critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the company s management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note  summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material 
management believes the company s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition  valuation and impairment of marketable securities  inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments  warranty costs  income taxes  and legal and other contingencies 
management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and operating results  and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters 
the company s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit and finance committee of the company s board of directors 
revenue recognition net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware  software  digital content and applications  peripherals  and service and support contracts 
the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred 
for most of the company s product sales  these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped 
for online sales to individuals  for some sales to education customers in the us  and for certain other sales  the company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit 
the company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products  
table of contents software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware  and third party digital content sold on the itunes store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions i standalone sales of software products  ii sales of software upgrades and iii sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware 
for multi element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware product s functionality  undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware product s essential software  and or undelivered non software services  the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices 
in such circumstances  the company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables i vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe  ii third party evidence of selling price tpe and iii best estimate of selling price esp 
vsoe generally exists only when the company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the company for that deliverable 
esps reflect the company s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand alone basis 
for sales of qualifying versions of ios devices  mac and apple tv  the company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features free of charge to customers 
the company also provides various non software services to owners of qualifying versions of ios devices and mac 
because the company has neither vsoe nor tpe for the unspecified software upgrade rights or the non software services  revenue is allocated to these rights and services based on the company s esps 
revenue allocated to the unspecified software upgrade rights and non software services based on the company s esps is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and non software services are expected to be provided for each of these devices  which ranges from two to four years 
the company s process for determining esps involves management s judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable 
if the facts and circumstances underlying the factors considered change  including the estimated or actual costs incurred to provide non software services or the estimated period the software upgrades and non software services are expected to be provided  or should future facts and circumstances lead the company to consider additional factors  the company s esps and the future rate of related amortization for software upgrades and non software services related to future sales of these devices could change 
the company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs 
for transactions involving price protection  the company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded  provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met 
the company s policy requires that  if refunds cannot be reliably estimated  revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses 
for the company s other customer incentive programs  the estimated cost is recognized at the later of the date at which the company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered 
the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the company s historical experience 
future market conditions and product transitions may require the company to increase customer incentive programs that could result in reductions to future revenue 
additionally  certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive 
management s estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs 
if a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeems such incentives  the company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue  which would have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
valuation and impairment of marketable securities the company s investments in available for sale securities are reported at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income  net 
table of contents of tax  in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
changes in the fair value of available for sale securities impact the company s net income only when such securities are sold or an other than temporary impairment is recognized 
realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each security s cost basis 
the company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is other than temporarily impaired  which would require the company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made 
in making this judgment  the company evaluates  among other things  the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost  the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto  and the company s intent to sell  or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell  the security before recovery of the its amortized cost basis 
the company s assessment on whether a security is other than temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security 
inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments 
the company records a write down for inventories of components and products  including third party products held for resale  which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value 
the company performs a detailed review of inventory each fiscal quarter that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts  product life cycle status  product development plans  current sales levels  and component cost trends 
the industries in which the company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes 
if future demand or market conditions for the company s products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory  the company may be required to record additional write downs  which would adversely affect its results of operations in the period when the write downs were recorded 
the company records accruals for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled 
consistent with industry practice  the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders  supplier contracts  and open orders based on projected demand information 
these commitments typically cover the company s requirements for periods up to days 
if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the company s products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the company s products  the company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would adversely affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded 
warranty costs the company provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates  historical and projected cost per claim  and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the company s typical experience 
each quarter  the company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary 
if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required and could materially affect the company s results of operations 
income taxes the company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations 
the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled 
the company records a 
table of contents valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 
the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income  including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies  together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets 
in the event that the company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future  the company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management s expectations could have a material impact on the company s financial condition and operating results 
legal and other contingencies as discussed in part i  item of this form k under the heading legal proceedings and in part ii  item of this form k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note  commitments and contingencies  the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims  including those that arise in the ordinary course of business 
the company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable 
there is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated 
in the opinion of management  there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss  or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual  with respect to loss contingencies for legal and other contingencies 
however  the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the company is subject to significant uncertainty 
therefore  although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote  if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management s expectations  the company s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected 
fiscal period the company s fiscal year is the or week period that ends on the last saturday of september

fiscal year spanned weeks  with a th week included in the first quarter of  as is done approximately every six years to realign the company s fiscal quarters more closely to calendar quarters

the foregoing statements regarding the company s expected gross margin percentage in future periods  including the first quarter of  are forward looking and could differ from actual results because of several factors including  but not limited to those set forth above in part i  item a of this form k under the heading risk factors and those described in this paragraph 
in general  gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors  including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures  increased competition  compressed product life cycles  product transitions and potential increases in the cost of components  as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the company s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins 
in response to competitive pressures  the company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions  which would adversely affect gross margins 
gross margins could also be affected by the company s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products 
due to the company s significant international operations  financial results can be significantly affected in the short term by fluctuations in exchange rates

off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations the company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the company has financial guarantees  subordinated retained interests  derivative instruments  or other contingent arrangements that expose the company to material continuing risks  contingent liabilities  or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk  or credit risk support to the company 
the following table presents certain payments due by the company under contractual obligations with minimum firm commitments as of september  and excludes amounts already recorded on the consolidated balance sheet in millions total payments due in less than year payments due in years payments due in years payments due in more than years operating leases purchase obligations other obligations total lease commitments the company s major facility leases are typically for terms not exceeding years and generally provide renewal options for terms not exceeding five additional years 
leases for retail space are for terms ranging from 
table of contents five to years  the majority of which are for years  and often contain multi year renewal options 
as of september   the company s total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were billion  of which billion related to leases for retail space 
purchase commitments with outsourcing partners and component suppliers the company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub assemblies for the company s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products 
these outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the company  which typically covers periods up to days 
the company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers 
consistent with industry practice  the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders  supplier contracts  and open orders based on projected demand information 
as of september   the company had outstanding off balance sheet third party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of billion 
other obligations in addition to the off balance sheet commitments mentioned above  the company had outstanding obligations of million as of september   that were comprised mainly of commitments to acquire capital assets  including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment  and commitments related to advertising  research and development  internet and telecommunications services and other obligations

as of september   the company had non current deferred tax liabilities of billion 
additionally  as of september   the company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of billion and an additional million for gross interest and penalties classified as non current liabilities 
at this time  the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years in connection with these tax liabilities  therefore  such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table 
indemnification the company generally does not indemnify end users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third party intellectual property rights 
other agreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the company could be subject to costs and or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the company or an indemnified third party 
however  the company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified third party 
in the opinion of management  there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of end users of its operating system or application software for infringement of third party intellectual property rights 
the company did not record a liability for infringement costs related to indemnification as of september  or september  the company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers 
under these agreements  the company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings 
it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim 
however  the company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations  and payments made under these agreements historically have not been material 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and foreign currency risk management the company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions  both on a stand alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures 
given the effective horizons of the company s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures  there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates 
further  the recognition timing of gains and losses related to these instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and  therefore  may adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results 
interest rate risk while the company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world s leading industrialized countries  the company s interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in us interest rates 
changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  the fair value of those securities  as well as costs associated with hedging 
the company s investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the liquidity requirements of the company 
a portion of the company s cash is managed by external managers within the guidelines of the company s investment policy and to objective market benchmarks 
the company s internal portfolio is benchmarked against external manager performance 
the company s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio 
the company typically invests in highly rated securities  and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the policy requires investments generally to be investment grade  with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss 
to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the company s investment portfolio  the company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a basis point parallel shift in the yield curve 
based on investment positions as of september   a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio 
as of september   a similar basis point shift in the yield curve would result in a million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio 
such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity 
foreign currency risk in general  the company is a net receiver of currencies other than the us dollar 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates  and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar  will negatively affect the company s net sales and gross margins as expressed in us dollars 
there is a risk that the company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there have been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities  certain firmly committed transactions  forecasted future cash flows  and net investments in foreign subsidiaries 
generally  the company s practice is to hedge a majority of its material foreign exchange exposures  typically for up to six months 
however  the company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons  including but not limited to accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures 

table of contents to provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the company s foreign currency derivative positions  the company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value at risk var model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates 
the var model consisted of using a monte carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions 
the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value  for a given confidence interval  to the company s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates 
the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool 
the model assumes normal market conditions 
forecasted transactions  firm commitments  and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model 
based on the results of the model  the company estimates with confidence a maximum one day loss in fair value of million as of september  compared to a maximum one day loss in fair value of million as of september  because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes  the loss in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures 
actual future gains and losses associated with the company s investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of september  due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchanges rates and the company s actual exposures and positions
