table of contents the dow chemical company and subsidiaries part i  item a 
risk factors 
risk factors the factors described below represent the company s principal risks 
global economic conditions the company operates in a global  competitive environment  which gives rise to operating and market risk exposure 
the company sells its broad range of products and services in a competitive  global environment  and competes worldwide for sales on the basis of product quality  price  technology and customer service 
increased levels of competition could result in lower prices or lower sales volume  which could have a negative impact on the company s results of operations 
economic conditions around the world and in certain industries in which the company does business also impact sales prices and volume 
as a result  an economic downturn in the geographic areas or industries in which dow sells its products could reduce demand for these products and result in decreased sales volume  which could have a negative impact on dow s results of operations 
in addition  volatility and disruption of financial markets could limit customers ability to obtain adequate financing to maintain operations  which could result in a decrease in sales volume and have a negative impact on dow s results of operations 
the company s global business operations also give rise to market risk exposure related to changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates  commodity prices and other market factors such as equity prices 
to manage such risks  dow enters into hedging transactions pursuant to established guidelines and policies 
if dow fails to effectively manage such risks  it could have a negative impact on the company s results of operations 
the economic environment impacts the fair value of pension and insurance assets  which could trigger increased future funding requirements of the pension trusts and could result in other than temporary impairment losses for certain insurance assets 
financial obligations and credit markets market conditions could reduce the company s flexibility to respond to changing business conditions or fund capital needs 
interest and dividend payments could increase the company s vulnerability to adverse economic conditions and reduce the company s flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions or to fund capital expenditures or working capital needs 
in addition  the economic environment could result in a contraction in the availability of credit in the marketplace and reduce sources of liquidity for the company 
this could result in higher borrowing costs 
raw materials availability of purchased feedstocks and energy and the volatility of these costs impact dow s operating costs and add variability to earnings 
the company purchases hydrocarbon raw materials including liquefied petroleum gases  naphtha  natural gas and condensate 
the company also purchases electric power  benzene  ethylene and propylene to supplement internal production  as well as other raw materials 
if the company s key suppliers are unable to provide the raw materials required for production  it could have a negative impact on dow s results of operations 
purchased feedstock and energy costs account for a substantial portion of the company s total production costs and operating expenses 
while the company uses its feedstock flexibility and financial and physical hedging programs to lower overall feedstock costs  when these costs increase the company is not always able to immediately raise selling prices  and  ultimately  the ability to pass on underlying cost increases is greatly dependent on market conditions 
conversely  when these costs decline  selling prices decline as well 
as a result  volatility in these costs could negatively impact the company s results of operations 
supply demand balance earnings generated by the company s basic chemical and plastic products vary based in part on the balance of supply relative to demand within the industry 
the balance of supply relative to demand within the industry may be significantly impacted by the addition of new capacity  especially for basic commodities where capacity is generally added in large increments as world scale facilities are built 
this may disrupt industry balances and result in downward pressure on prices due to the increase in supply  which could negatively impact the company s results of operations 

table of contents litigation the company is party to a number of claims and lawsuits arising out of the normal course of business with respect to commercial matters including product liability  governmental regulation and other actions 
certain of the claims and lawsuits facing the company purport to be class actions and seek damages in very large amounts 
all such claims are contested 
with the exception of the possible effect of the asbestos related liability of union carbide corporation union carbide  described below  it is the opinion of the company s management that the possibility is remote that the aggregate of all such claims and lawsuits will have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
union carbide is and has been involved in a large number of asbestos related suits filed primarily in state courts during the past three decades 
at december   union carbide s asbestos related liability for pending and future claims was million million at december  and its receivable for insurance recoveries related to the asbestos liability was million million at december  
at december   union carbide also had receivables of million million at december  for insurance recoveries for defense and resolution costs 
it is the opinion of the company s management that it is reasonably possible that the cost of union carbide disposing of its asbestos related claims  including future defense costs  could have a material impact on the company s results of operations and cash flows for a particular period and on the consolidated financial position of the company 
environmental compliance the costs of complying with evolving regulatory requirements could negatively impact the company s financial results 
actual or alleged violations of environmental laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations  substantial civil or criminal sanctions  as well as the assessment of strict liability and or joint and several liability 
the company is subject to extensive federal  state  local and foreign laws  regulations  rules and ordinances relating to pollution  protection of the environment  greenhouse gas emissions  and the generation  storage  handling  transportation  treatment  disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials 
at december   the company had accrued obligations of million million at december  for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs  including million million at december  for the remediation of superfund sites 
this is management s best estimate of the costs for remediation and restoration with respect to environmental matters for which the company has accrued liabilities  although it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to approximately twice that amount 
costs and capital expenditures relating to environmental  health or safety matters are subject to evolving regulatory requirements and depend on the timing of the promulgation and enforcement of specific standards which impose the requirements 
moreover  changes in environmental regulations could inhibit or interrupt the company s operations  or require modifications to its facilities 
accordingly  environmental  health or safety regulatory matters could result in significant unanticipated costs or liabilities 
chemical safety increased concerns regarding the safe use of chemicals in commerce and their potential impact on the environment have resulted in more restrictive regulations from local  state and federal governments and could lead to new regulations 
concerns regarding the safe use of chemicals in commerce and their potential impact on health and the environment reflect a growing trend in societal demands for increasing levels of product safety and environmental protection 
these concerns could manifest themselves in stockholder proposals  preferred purchasing and continued pressure for more stringent regulatory intervention 
these concerns could also influence public perceptions  the viability of the company s products  the company s reputation and the cost to comply with regulations 
in addition  terrorist attacks and natural disasters have increased concerns about the security and safety of chemical production and distribution 
these concerns could have a negative impact on the company s results of operations 
local  state and federal governments continue to propose new regulations related to the security of chemical plant locations and the transportation of hazardous chemicals  which could result in higher operating costs and interruptions in normal business operations 

table of contents operational event a significant operational event could negatively impact the company s results of operations 
as a diversified chemical manufacturing company  the company s operations  the transportation of products  cyber attacks  or severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena such as drought  hurricanes  earthquakes  tsunamis  floods  etc 
could result in an unplanned event that could be significant in scale and could negatively impact operations  neighbors or the public at large  which could have a negative impact on the company s results of operations 
in the past  major hurricanes have caused significant disruption in dow s operations on the us gulf coast  logistics across the region  and the supply of certain raw materials  which had an adverse impact on volume and cost for some of dow s products 
due to the company s substantial presence on the us gulf coast  similar severe weather conditions or other natural phenomena in the future could negatively affect dow s results of operations 
company strategy implementing certain elements of the company s strategy could negatively impact the company s financial results 
the company formed a new joint venture and is evaluating the formation of other joint ventures in emerging geographies to build and operate integrated  world scale facilities 
large projects like these  as well as other proposed and existing projects of varying size in these geographies  are accompanied by uncertainty and risks including navigating different government regulatory environments  relationships with new  local partners  project funding commitments and guarantees  war  terrorism and political instability  uninsurable risks  and determining raw material supply and other details regarding product movement 
if the implementation of these projects is not successful  it could adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
goodwill an impairment of goodwill would negatively impact the company s financial results 
the april  acquisition of rohm and haas company increased the company s goodwill by billion 
at least annually  the company assesses goodwill for impairment 
if an initial qualitative assessment identifies that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  additional quantitative testing is performed 
if the quantitative testing indicates that goodwill is impaired  the carrying value of goodwill is written down to fair value with a charge against earnings 
since the company utilizes a discounted cash flow methodology to calculate the fair value of its reporting units  continued weak demand for a specific product line or business could result in an impairment 
accordingly  any determination requiring the write off of a significant portion of goodwill could negatively impact the company s results of operations 
implementation of erp system the company s implementation of a new enterprise resource planning erp system may adversely affect the company s business and results of operations or the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting 
during the first quarter of  the company began implementing a new erp system that will deliver a new generation of work processes and information systems 
erp implementations are complex and time consuming projects that involve substantial expenditures on system software and implementation activities that take several years 
erp implementations also require transformation of business and financial processes in order to reap the benefits of the erp system 
if the company does not effectively implement the erp system as planned or if the system does not operate as intended  it could adversely affect financial reporting systems  the company s ability to produce financial reports  and or the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting

table of contents the dow chemical company and subsidiaries part i  item legal proceedings 
legal proceedings asbestos related matters of union carbide corporation union carbide corporation union carbide  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  is and has been involved in a large number of asbestos related suits filed primarily in state courts during the past three decades 
these suits principally allege personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestos containing products and frequently seek both actual and punitive damages 
the alleged claims primarily relate to products that union carbide sold in the past  alleged exposure to asbestos containing products located on union carbide s premises  and union carbide s responsibility for asbestos suits filed against a former union carbide subsidiary  amchem products  inc it is the opinion of dow s management that it is reasonably possible that the cost of union carbide disposing of its asbestos related claims  including future defense costs  could have a material impact on the company s results of operations and cash flows for a particular period and on the consolidated financial position of the company
