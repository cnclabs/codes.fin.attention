paul  chicago and atlanta 
these programs provide a base of current business and the potential for additional future business as the systems are expanded 
industry overview transport agencies  particularly those based in the us  rely heavily on federal  state and local governments for subsidies in capital investments  including new procurements and or upgrades of automated fare collection systems 
the average lifecycle for rail fare collection systems is to years  and for bus systems is to years 
procurements tend to follow a long and strict competitive bid process where low price is a significant factor 
the automated fare collection business is a niche market which is only able to sustain a relatively few number of suppliers 
because of the long life expectancy of these systems and the few companies able to supply them  there is fierce competition to win these jobs  often resulting in low initial contract profitability 
advances in communications  networking and security technologies are enabling interoperability of multiple modes of transportation within a single networked system  as well as interoperability of multiple transit operators within a single networked system 
as such  there is a growing trend for regional ticketing systems  usually built around a large transit agency and including neighboring operators  all sharing a common regional transit payment media 
recent transit agency procurements for open payment fare systems will extend the acceptance of payment media from transit smart cards  to contactless bank cards and near field communication nfc enabled smart phones 
there is also an emerging trend for other applications to be added to these regional systems to expand the utility of the transit payment media  offering higher value and incentives to the end users  and lowering costs and creating new revenue streams for the regional system operators 
as a result  these regional systems have created opportunities for new levels of systems support and services including customer support call center and web support services  smart card production and distribution  financial clearing and settlement  retail merchant network management  transit benefit support  and software application support 
in some cases  operators are choosing to outsource the ongoing operations and commercialization of these regional ticketing systems 
this growing new market provides the opportunity to establish lasting relationships and grow revenues and profits over the long term 
raw materials cts raw materials used by cts include sheet steel  composite products  copper electrical wire and castings 
a significant portion of our end product is composed of purchased electronic components and subcontracted parts and supplies 
we procure all of these items from commercial sources 
in general  supplies of raw materials and purchased parts are adequate to meet our requirements 
backlog cts funded sales backlog of cts at september  and amounted to billion and billion  respectively 
we expect that approximately billion of the september  backlog will not be completed by september  cts competitive environment we are one of several companies that specialize in providing automated fare collection systems solutions and services for public transport operators worldwide 
our competitors include thales  acs a xerox company  and scheidt bachmann 
the requirements of recent open standards fare collection system procurements call for system integration with payment industry infrastructures and outsourcing of longer term it support functions  which can be attractive to other it system integrators such as accenture and ibm 
in addition  there are many smaller local competitors  particularly in european and asian markets 
for large tenders  our competitors may form consortiums that could include telecommunications companies  financial institutions and consulting companies in addition to the fare collection and computer services companies noted above 
these procurement activities are very competitive and require that we have highly skilled and experienced technical personnel to compete 
we believe that our competitive advantages include intermodal and interagency regional integration expertise  technical skills  past contract performance  systems quality and reliability  experience in the industry and long term customer relationships 
defense systems segment cubic defense systems cds consists of several market focused businesses training systems  communications  and cyber security 
our systems and products include customized military range instrumentation systems  laser based training systems  virtual simulation systems  communications products including data links  power amplifiers  avionics systems  multi band communication tracking devices  and cross domain hardware solutions to address multi level security requirements 
we market our capabilities directly to various us government departments and agencies  as well as foreign governments 
in addition  we frequently contract or team with other leading defense suppliers 
training systems our training systems business is a pioneer and market leader in the design  innovation  and manufacture of instrumented training systems and products for militaries of allied nations 
instrumented training systems are used for live training in air and ground combat domains  with weapons and other effects simulated by electronics  software and or laser technologies 
these systems collect and record simulated weapons engagements  tactical behavior  and event data to evaluate combat effectiveness  lessons learned  and provide a basis to develop after action reviews 
our training business is organized into air combat  ground combat and virtual training divisions 
in air combat  cubic was the initial developer and supplier of air combat maneuvering instrumentation acmi capability during the vietnam war 
the acmi product line has progressed through several generations of technologies and capabilities 
we continue to maintain a market leadership position based on the competitive award of a year  million indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contract in as well as follow on contracts  for the p acmi system  to provide advanced air combat training capability to the us air force  navy and marine corps 
in fiscal year  cubic was awarded a p acmi system contract with a total price of million for operational training by us and australian forces 
in  cubic was awarded a million development contract to produce an internal version of the p system for use on the f joint strike fighter 
the f project is progressing toward production in concert with the aircraft program 
in concert with many nations employing our acmi systems for air to air combat training  cubic provides on site operations and maintenance support of our systems at several worldwide locations 
ground combat training uses systems analogous to air ranges for ground force training 
the systems are generally known as tactical engagement simulation systems or multiple integrated laser engagement simulation miles equipment 
our leadership role in instrumented training was established during the s when cubic provided turnkey systems for us army training centers including the joint readiness training center jrtc at fort polk  la and combat maneuver training center cmtc at hohenfels  germany  now known as the joint multinational readiness center 
since the completion of these original contracts  we have significantly expanded our market footprint with the sale of fixed  mobile and urban operation training centers to uniformed military and security forces in the us and allied nations around the world 
we have increased our focus on joint training solutions and those that can operate simultaneously in multiple simulation environments including live  virtual  constructive and gaming domains 
laser based tactical engagement simulation systems are used at combat training centers ctc to permit weapons to be used realistically  registering hits or kills  without live ammunition 
we supply miles equipment as part of ctc contracts 
cubic miles systems are being utilized by all branches of the us armed services  as well as the department of energy  and numerous international government customers 
our virtual training product line provides virtual training systems for various applications  employing actual or realistic weapons and systems together with visual imagery to simulate battlefield environments 
cubic also provides maintenance trainers for combat systems and vehicles  as well as operational trainers for missiles  armored vehicles and naval applications 
communications our communications business is a supplier of secure data links  high power rf amplifiers  direction finding systems  remote video terminals  and search and rescue avionics for the us military  government agencies  and allied nations 
we supplied the air ground secure data link for the us army air force joint stars system during the s  as well as the united kingdom s astor program and continue to provide spare parts and system upgrades 
more recently we have focused on the supply of common data link cdl products for shipborne applications  unmanned aerial vehicles uav  remote video terminals and hand held products 
capitalizing on a multiyear internal r d program  we won a competitive contract in fiscal year to develop and produce the common data link subsystem cdls for the us navy 
cdls has been installed on major surface ships of the us fleet 
smaller  tactical versions of our common data link have been selected for both uav and remote video terminal applications such as the uk watchkeeper and the us firescout uav programs 
our personnel locator system pls is standard equipment on us aircraft with a search and rescue mission 
pls is designed to interface with all modern search and rescue system standards 
we also supply high power amplifiers and direction finding systems to major primes and end users for both domestic and international applications 
these include systems used by the canadian coast guard  the us navy  the us air force and the french army 
in may cubic acquired the assets of impeva labs and formed a new subsidiary called cubic global tracking solutions  inc cgts 
cgts global tracking technology is deployed with the us department of defense dod for tracking and monitoring dod supply chain assets 
the products employ satellite  gsm mobile communications and encrypted mesh network technologies 
the company offers a device management center that provides continuous  reliable  real time monitoring and event notification without fixed infrastructure 
the global tracking products were consolidated with the communications business unit after the end of fiscal year cyber security in june cubic acquired safe harbor holdings  a cyber security and information assurance company  and formed a new subsidiary called cubic cyber solutions  inc ccsi 
ccsi provides specialized security and networking infrastructure  system certification and accreditation  and enterprise level network architecture and engineering services 
the company also provides cross domain hardware solutions to address multi level security challenges across common networks 
more recently certain ccsi operations have been consolidated within our newly acquired subsidiary  abraxas corporation  to simplify recruiting  program management and customer interfaces 
raw materials cds the principal raw materials used by cds are sheet aluminum and steel  copper electrical wire and composite products 
a significant portion of our end products are composed of purchased electronic components and subcontracted parts and supplies 
we procure these items primarily from commercial sources 
in general  supplies of raw materials and purchased parts are adequate to meet our requirements 
backlog cds funded sales backlog of cds at september  was million compared to million at september  we expect that approximately million of the september  backlog will not be completed by september  mission support services segment cubic mission support services mss is a leading provider of training  operations  intelligence  maintenance  technical  and other support services to the us government and allied nations 
mss is comprised of approximately  employees working at more than locations in nations throughout the world 
our employees serve with clients in actual training and operational environments to help prepare and support forces through provision of comprehensive training  exercises  staff augmentation  education  operational  intelligence  technical  and logistical assistance to meet the full scope of their assigned missions 
the scope of mission support that we provide includes training and rehearsals for both small and large scale combat operations  training and preparation of military advisor teams  mobilization and demobilization of forces prior to and following deployment  combat and material development  military staff augmentation  information technology and information assurance  logistics and maintenance support for fielded and deployed systems  support to national security and special operations activities  peacekeeping  consequence management  and humanitarian assistance operations worldwide 
we plan  prepare  execute and document realistic and focused mission rehearsal exercises using both live and computer based exercises as final preparation of forces prior to deployment 
in addition  we provide high level consultation and advisory services to the governments and militaries of allied nations 
us government service contracts are typically awarded on a competitive basis with options for multiple years 
we typically compete as a prime contractor to the government  but also team with other companies 
during the past year we have experienced increased price competition and contract awards for shorter performance periods 
also  due to the us government s increased emphasis on small business contracting  we have increased the amount of subcontracts to small businesses 
in addition  some of the contracts where we were the prime contractor in the past were re competed as small business contracts and we are now a subcontractor with a reduced role 
much of our early work centered on battle command training and simulation in which military commanders are taught to make correct decisions in battlefield situations 
our comprehensive business base has broadened to include integrated live  virtual and constructive training support  advanced distance learning and other professional military education  comprehensive logistics and maintenance support  weapons effects and analytical modeling  analysis and other support to the national security community  homeland security training and exercises  training and preparation of us army and marine corps foreign service advisor teams  and military force modernization 
additionally  we support the deployment and re deployment of both active and reserve component forces  and we provide in country logistics  maintenance  operational and training support to us forces deployed in overseas locations 
our contracts include providing mission support services to three of the army s major ctc s jrtc as prime contractor and the national training center ntc and mission command training program mctp as a principal subcontractor 
these services include planning  executing and documenting realistic and stressful large scale exercises and mission rehearsals that increase the readiness of both active and reserve us conventional and special operations forces by placing them in situations as close to actual combat as possible 
for the us joint community  mss is a principal member of the contractor team that supports and helps manage and execute all aspects of the operations of the joint coalition warfare center jcwc  including support to worldwide joint exercises and the development and fielding of the joint national training capability jntc 
under the marine air ground task force magtf training systems support mtss contract  we provide comprehensive training and exercise support to us marine corps forces worldwide  including real world mission rehearsals 
we have planned and executed virtually all marine corps simulation based exercises worldwide since  directly preparing marines for combat operations 
we provide training and professional military education support to the us army s quartermaster center and school  the signal school and to the transportation school 
we also provide contractor maintenance and instructional support necessary to operate and maintain a wide variety of flight simulation and training systems and other facilities worldwide  for us and allied forces under multiple long term contracts  including direct support to usmc aircrew training systems worldwide 
in addition  we provide a broad range of operational support to the us navy for anti submarine warfare asw and counter mine operations and training 
we support the defense threat reduction agency dtra with technology based engineering and other services necessary to accomplish dtra s mission of predicting and defeating the effects of chemical  biological  radiological  nuclear and high explosive cbrne weapons 
we support dtra with modeling and simulations to analyze  assess and predict the effects of such weapons in combat and other environments 
additionally  we provide comprehensive support to help plan  manage and execute dtra s worldwide consequence management exercise program  which trains senior us and allied civilian and military personnel  first responders and other users of dtra products 
we provide research  development and technical engineering rdte support to the us air force research laboratories afrl for assistance in the identification and application of current  new and emerging technologies leading to proof of principle evaluations of advanced operational concepts 
we have multiple contracts with all us armed services and other government agencies to improve the quality and reach of training and education of individuals and small teams up through collective training of large organizations 
our services  products and capabilities include development and deployment of curriculum and related courseware  computer based training  knowledge management and distribution  advanced distance learning e learning  serious military games for training and other advanced education programs for us and allied forces 
an important part of our services business is to provide specialized teams of military experts to advise the governments and militaries of the nations of the former warsaw pact and soviet union  and other former communist countries in the transformation of their militaries to a nato environment 
these very broad defense modernization contracts entail sweeping vision and minute detail  involving both the nations strategic foundation and the detailed planning of all aspects of reform 
we also develop and operate battle simulation centers for us forces in europe  as well as for select countries in central and eastern europe 
in december of  we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of abraxas corporation abraxas  a herndon  virginia based company that provides support services to the military and national intelligence communities  and subject matter and operational expertise for special operations  law enforcement and homeland security clients 
we believe the combination and scope of our growing mission support services and training systems business is unique in the industry  permitting us to offer customers a complete training and combat readiness capability from one source 
backlog mss funded sales backlog of our mss segment at september  was million compared to million at september  total backlog  including unfunded customer orders and options under multiyear service contracts  was million at september  compared to million at september  we expect that approximately million of the september  total backlog will not be completed by september  mss and cds competitive environment cubic s broad defense business portfolio means we compete with numerous companies  large and small  domestic and international 
well known competitors include lockheed martin  northrop grumman  general dynamics  boeing  l communications and saic  as well as other smaller companies 
in many cases  we have also teamed with these same companies  in both prime and subcontractor roles  on specific bid opportunities 
while we are generally smaller than our principle competitors  we believe our competitive advantages include an outstanding record of past performance  strong incumbent relationships  the ability to control operating costs and the ability to rapidly focus technology and innovation to solve customer problems 
projects must compete for funding in the defense budget 
while the us defense budget is expected to decrease over the next few years  we believe there is potential for long term growth to occur in those segments that offer high payoff and are consistent with peacetime readiness priorities and growing fiscal constraints 
the us defense market today can be characterized as highly dynamic  with priorities and funding shifting in reaction to  or anticipation of  world events much more rapidly than during the cold war or since 
overarching military priorities include lighter  faster  more lethal forces with the ability and training to rapidly adapt to new situations based on superior knowledge of the battle environment 
superior knowledge is enabled by systems that rapidly collect  process and disseminate the right information to the right place at the right time  resulting in what dod calls network centric warfare 
we believe our training systems  training support  operational support  and intelligence  surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities are well matched to these sustainable defense priorities 
business strategy our objective is to consistently grow sales  improve profitability and deliver attractive returns on capital 
we intend to expand our position as the leading provider of automated payment and fare collection systems and services to transport authorities worldwide and build on our position with us and foreign governments as the leading full spectrum supplier of training systems and mission support services  and grow our niche position as a supplier of data links and communications products 
our strategies to achieve these objectives include leverage long term relationships we seek to maintain long term relationships with our customers through repeat business by continuing to achieve high levels of performance and providing innovations on our existing contracts 
by achieving this goal  we can leverage our returns through repeat business with existing customers and expand our presence in the market through sales of similar systems at good value to additional customers 
cts maintains continuous long term relationships with its customers  such as in the case of transport for london tfl where our partnership started with a small trial of magnetic ticketing and gating in since then we have continuously delivered fare collection equipment and systems to tfl as its fare collection system and service provider 
most recently our role was expanded under a contract awarded by tfl 
we are now the prime contractor responsible for operating and maintaining the oyster system 
this contract  the future ticket agreement  will continue our relationship with tfl until a re compete is required in our track record of performance in supplying and servicing some of the largest automated fare collection systems around the world has led to three major design  build  operate and maintain contract wins since in  the south coast british columbia transportation authority awarded a contract to us for the open payment ready smart card and faregate system for the greater vancouver region and the chicago transit authority cta selected us for their open standards fare system contract 
in  the public transport ticketing corporation pttc selected us to provide greater sydney s electronic ticketing system 
these recent contract award decisions were reinforced by our long term performance in other major metropolitan areas including san francisco bay area since  washington dc  since  and new york since development of long term relationships is a vital part of cds business strategy 
multi year contracts and customer engagements offer increased revenue opportunities through upgrades  operations and maintenance services contracts  and product refresh 
cds has enjoyed five to ten year engagements with many customers including several that span several decades with core us army and us air force customers 
cds is leveraging its ground combat training credentials earned in the us to provide integrated system and service solutions to allied nations 
we intend to design  build  equip and service ground combat training systems for our foreign customers  providing them with turnkey solutions that result in long term relationships 
for example  for the british army  cds delivered combat training ranges in the united kingdom and canada under an initial contract awarded in and has continued to provide operations and maintenance support  as well post design services and equipment upgrades for the last decade 
other turnkey opportunities include allied nations in the middle east  far east and europe 
maintaining strong customer relationships is particularly important for mss as we rely heavily on our current and past performance to win recompete contracts and gain new customers 
as a result of maintaining a high level of performance  we continue to provide a combination of our support services for our principal long term customers including the jrtc since  the marine corps since  and the us army s combined arms center cac at fort leavenworth and the army s centers of excellence since our continuous record of performance for these customers helps us to gain new business 
expand services business we view services as a core element of our business and we are working to expand our service offerings and customer base 
in aggregate  approximately of our sales revenue in was from service work 
we believe that a strong base of service work helps to consistently generate profits and smooth the revenue fluctuations inherent in systems work 
at cts  our managed service offerings are growing 
due to the technical complexities of operating electronic fare collection and payment systems  transit agencies are turning to their system suppliers for it services and other operational and maintenance services  such as regional settlement  card management and customer support services that would otherwise be performed by the transit agency 
as a result  we are transitioning from an automated fare collection supplier to an it delivery and services company 
this transition is expressed in our vision for the future of transport named nextcity 
nextcity envisions the further integration of payment and information systems of all transport modes  ultimately expanding our universe of opportunities to include all forms of transport 
we now provide a suite of turnkey outsourced services for more than transit authorities worldwide 
approximately of cts sales were from service business in today  cts delivers a wide range of services from customer support to financial management and technical support at its full service operation centers in concord  california  brisbane  australia and london  england 
earlier in the year  we began to utilize our tullahoma  tennessee facility as an overflow service center of patron call support for both the east and west coasts of the us this is a further step toward delivering customer services from key service facilities for multiple transit authorities worldwide 
at mss  we provide a combination of services to our many customers 
multiple award indefinite delivery indefinite quantity id iq contracts are now the primary contract vehicle in the government services marketplace 
we have increased our participation on id iq contracts  giving us more opportunities to bid for work and increasing our chances to develop new customers  programs and capabilities 
we expand our scope of opportunities by offering additional services to current customers and transferring our skill sets to support similar programs for new customers 
the broad spectrum of services we offer reinforces this strategy  and includes planning and support for theater and worldwide exercises  computer based simulations  training and preparation of foreign military advisor and transition teams  mobilization and demobilization of deploying forces  range support and operations  logistics and maintenance operations  curriculum and leadership development  intelligence support  force modernization  open source data collection  as well as engineering and other technical support 
for cds  increased services and operations and maintenance opportunities can reduce the volatility and timing uncertainties associated with large equipment contracts and add depth to the revenue base 
compared to the us market where small business requirements  omnibus contracts and local preferences create acquisition challenges  the international market offers greater opportunities to bundle and negotiate multi year  turn key contracts 
we believe these long term contracts reinforce cds s competitive posture and enable the company to provide enhanced services through regular customer contact and increased visibility of product performance and reliability 
in december of we acquired abraxas  which expands our support services to the military and national intelligence communities  as well as for special operations  law enforcement and homeland security clients 
with this acquisition and our organic skillsets  we are broadening our service offerings across the dod and national security markets to pursue prime contract opportunities 
maintain a diversified business mix we have a diverse mix of business in our three segments 
approximately of our sales are made directly or indirectly to the us government  however  this represents a wide variety of product and service sales to many different us government agencies 
the largest single contract in the transportation segment represented more than of consolidated sales in no other single customer represented or more of our revenues 
expand international footprint we have developed a large global presence in our three business segments 
cts has delivered over projects in major markets on five continents 
cds has delivered systems in more than nations  and mss supports customers in more than locations in nations worldwide 
cts made an important expansion in australia with the recent award of the electronic ticketing system for sydney and the state of new south wales in the australia operation is now one of three primary operating regions of cts alongside north america and europe  and will be the base for us to pursue opportunities in the asia pacific region 
in europe  we are focused on growing our presence in germany where we were awarded a contract in by rhein main services rms on behalf of the transit authority rhein main verkehrsverbund 
this year we successfully deployed their regional electronic ticketing system 
in india  we continue our commitment to utilizing local engineering talent and pursuing automatic fare collection business 
in fiscal year more than of cds s revenues were derived from international customers including foreign military sales fms and foreign military financing contracts 
the company maintains a significant international marketing pipeline particularly in asia pacific  the middle east and europe 
to better serve its customers and to expand sales opportunities  the company opened offices in rome  italy and abu dhabi during these offices coupled with existing operations in asia pacific and europe represent the direct marketing channel to regional customers 
fms contracts are typically developed by the product lines in conjunction with us contracting authorities 
pursue strategic acquisitions we are focused on finding attractive acquisitions that enhance our market positions and lead to long term profitability 
we look for specific growth opportunities in the defense and transportation marketplaces 
the acquisition of abraxas in december was an important acquisition that further diversified our customer base and will enable us to expand our present offerings into significant markets for national security 
other matters we pursue a policy of seeking patent protection for our products where deemed advisable  but do not regard ourselves as materially dependent on patents for the maintenance of our competitive position 
we do not engage in any business that is seasonal in nature 
since our revenues are generated primarily from work on contracts performed by our employees and subcontractors  first quarter revenues tend to be lower than the other three quarters due to our policy of providing many of our employees seven holidays in the first quarter  compared to one or two in each of the other quarters of the year 
this is not necessarily a consistent pattern as it depends upon actual activities in any given year 
the cost of company sponsored research and development r d activities was million  million  million and million in   and  respectively 
in addition to internally funded r d  a significant portion of our new product development occurs in conjunction with the performance of work on our contracts 
the amount of contract required product development activity was approximately million in compared to million  million and million in  and  respectively  however  these costs are included in cost of sales as they are directly related to contract performance 
we comply with federal  state and local laws and regulations regarding discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposal of materials classed as hazardous and or toxic 
such compliance has no material effect upon our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
we employed approximately  persons at september  our domestic products and services are sold almost entirely by our employees 
overseas sales are made either directly or through representatives or agents 
item a 
risk factors 
the following are some of the factors we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us  or that we currently see as immaterial  may also harm our business 
if any of the risks or uncertainties described below or any such additional risks and uncertainties actually occur  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
this could cause the trading price of our stock to decline 
you should also refer to the other information set forth in this annual report  including our financial statements and the related notes  and other public filings 
we have restated our prior consolidated financial statements  which may lead to additional risks and uncertainties  including shareholder litigation 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item of this report  we have restated our consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended september   and  and for the quarterly periods ended december  through march  the determination to restate these consolidated financial statements and the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements was made by our audit committee upon management s recommendation following the identification of errors related to our method of recognizing revenues on certain contracts 
as a result of these events  we have become subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties  including substantial unanticipated costs for accounting and legal fees in connection with or related to the restatement 
if litigation did occur  we may incur additional substantial defense costs regardless of their outcome 
likewise  such events might cause a diversion of our management s time and attention 
if we do not prevail in any such litigation  we could be required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs 
we have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which could  if not remediated  result in additional material misstatements in our financial statements 
our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting  as defined in rule a f under the securities exchange act of  as amended 
as disclosed in item a  management identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting related to accounting for revenue on certain types of contracts 
a material weakness is defined as a deficiency  or combination of deficiencies  in internal control over financial reporting  such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 
as a result of these material weaknesses  our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organization of the treadway commission in internal control an integrated framework 
we are actively engaged in developing a remediation plan designed to address these material weaknesses 
if our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weaknesses  or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control are discovered or occur in the future  our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results  which could lead to substantial additional costs for accounting and legal fees and shareholder litigation 
we depend on government contracts for substantially all of our revenues and the loss of government contracts or a delay or decline in funding of existing or future government contracts could adversely affect our sales and cash flows and our ability to fund our growth 
our revenues from contracts  directly or indirectly  with foreign and united states  state  regional and local governmental agencies represented more than of our total revenues in fiscal year although these various government agencies are subject to common budgetary pressures and other factors  many of our various government customers exercise independent purchasing decisions 
as a result of the concentration of business with governmental agencies  we are vulnerable to adverse changes in our revenues  income and cash flows if a significant number of our government contracts  subcontracts or prospects are delayed or canceled for budgetary or other reasons 
the factors that could cause us to lose these contracts or could otherwise materially harm our business  prospects  financial condition or results of operations include re allocation of government resources as the result of actual or threatened terrorism or hostile activities or for other reasons  budget constraints affecting government spending generally  or specific departments or agencies such as us or foreign defense and transit agencies and regional transit agencies  and changes in fiscal policies or a reduction of available funding  disruptions in our customers ability to access funding from capital markets  curtailment of government s use of outsourced service providers  the adoption of new laws or regulations pertaining to government procurement  government appropriations delays or blanket reductions in departmental budgets  such as which will automatically take effect if congress fails to act on budget reduction plans by the end of  suspension or prohibition from contracting with the government or any significant agency with which we conduct business  impairment of our reputation or relationships with any significant government agency with which we conduct business  impairment of our ability to provide third party guarantees and letters of credit  and delays in the payment of our invoices by government payment offices 
government spending priorities may change in a manner adverse to our businesses 
in the past  our businesses have been adversely affected by significant changes in government spending during periods of declining budgets 
a significant decline in overall spending  or the decision not to exercise options to renew contracts  or the loss of or substantial decline in spending on a large program in which we participate could materially adversely affect our business  prospects  financial condition or results of operations 
as an example  the us defense and national security budgets in general  and spending in specific agencies with which we work  such as the dod  have declined from time to time for extended periods  resulting in program delays  program cancellations and a slowing of new program starts 
although spending on defense related programs by the us government has increased in recent years  future levels of expenditures and authorizations for those programs may decrease  remain constant or shift to programs in areas where we do not currently provide products or services 
even though our contract periods of performance for a program may exceed one year  congress must usually approve funds for a given program each fiscal year and may significantly reduce funding of a program in a particular year 
significant reductions in these appropriations or the amount of new defense contracts awarded may affect our ability to complete contracts  obtain new work and grow our business 
congress does not always enact spending bills by the beginning of the new fiscal year 
such delays leave the affected agencies under funded which delays their ability to contract 
future delays and uncertainties in funding could impose additional business risks on us 
in addition  the dod has recently increased its emphasis on awarding contracts to small businesses and has decreased the period of performance of some contracts  which increases our bid and proposal costs 
sequestration may adversely affect our businesses which are dependent on federal government funding 
pursuant to a law passed in august  unless the administration and congress reach an agreement on spending cuts and increased revenues for the federal government by january   there will be deep and automatic cuts in defense budgets and other non defense budgets 
it is unknown what programs will be cut  over what time period and by what amount 
some programs may be cancelled in their entirety 
all of our us defense contracts are at risk of being cut or terminated 
our domestic transportation contracts could be materially harmed if transit agencies do not receive expected federal funds and are required to curtail their plans to expand or upgrade their fare collection systems 
our contracts with government agencies may be terminated or modified prior to completion  which could adversely affect our business 
government contracts typically contain provisions and are subject to laws and regulations that give the government agencies rights and remedies not typically found in commercial contracts  including providing the government agency with the ability to unilaterally terminate our existing contracts  reduce the value of our existing contracts  modify some of the terms and conditions in our existing contracts  suspend or permanently prohibit us from doing business with the government or with any specific government agency  control and potentially prohibit the export of our products  cancel or delay existing multiyear contracts and related orders if the necessary funds for contract performance for any subsequent year are not appropriated  decline to exercise an option to extend an existing multiyear contract  and claim rights in technologies and systems invented  developed or produced by us 
most us government agencies and some other agencies with which we contract can terminate their contracts with us for convenience  and in that event we generally may recover only our incurred or committed costs  settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination 
if an agency terminates a contract with us for default  we are denied any recovery and may be liable for excess costs incurred by the agency in procuring undelivered items from an alternative source 
we may receive show cause or cure notices under contracts that  if not addressed to the agency s satisfaction  could give the agency the right to terminate those contracts for default or to cease procuring our services under those contracts 
in the event that any of our contracts were to be terminated or adversely modified  there may be significant adverse effects on our revenues  operating costs and income that would not be recoverable 
changes in future business or other market conditions could cause business investments and or recorded goodwill or other long term assets to become impaired  resulting in substantial losses and write downs that would reduce our results of operations 
as part of our strategy  we will  from time to time  acquire a minority or majority interest in a business 
these investments are made upon careful analysis and due diligence procedures designed to achieve a desired return or strategic objective 
these procedures often involve certain assumptions and judgment in determining acquisition price 
after acquisition  unforeseen issues could arise which adversely affect the anticipated returns or which are otherwise not recoverable as an adjustment to the purchase price 
even after careful integration efforts  actual operating results may vary significantly from initial estimates 
we evaluate our recorded goodwill balances for potential impairment annually as of july  or when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value  including recorded goodwill 
we have not yet had a case where the carrying value exceeded the fair value  however  if it did  impairment would be measured by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying value  and any impairment determined would be recorded in the current period  which could result in substantial losses and write downs that would reduce our results of operations 
for more information on accounting policies we have in place for impairment of goodwill  see our discussion under valuation of goodwill in item of this form k 
failure to retain existing contracts or win new contracts under competitive bidding processes may adversely affect our revenue 
we obtain most of our contracts through a competitive bidding process  and substantially all of the business that we expect to seek in the foreseeable future likely will be subject to a competitive bidding process 
competitive bidding presents a number of risks  including the need to compete against companies or teams of companies with more financial and marketing resources and more experience in bidding on and performing major contracts than we have  the need to compete against companies or teams of companies that may be long term  entrenched incumbents for a particular contract for which we are competing and that have  as a result  greater domain expertise and better customer relations  the need to compete to retain existing contracts that have in the past been awarded to us on a sole source basis or as to which we have been incumbent for a long time  the us government s increased emphasis on awarding contracts to small businesses could preclude us from bidding on certain work or reduce the scope of work we can bid as a prime contractor  the expense and delay that may arise if our competitors protest or challenge new contract awards  the need to bid on some programs in advance of the completion of their design  which may result in higher research and development expenditures  unforeseen technological difficulties  or increased costs which lower our profitability  the substantial cost and managerial time and effort  including design  development and marketing activities  necessary to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us  the need to develop  introduce and implement new and enhanced solutions to our customers needs  the need to locate and contract with teaming partners and subcontractors  and the need to accurately estimate the resources and cost structure that will be required to perform any fixed price contract that we are awarded 
we may not be afforded the opportunity in the future to bid on contracts that are held by other companies and are scheduled to expire if the agency decides to extend the existing contract 
if we are unable to win particular contracts that are awarded through the competitive bidding process  we may not be able to operate in the market for services that are provided under those contracts for a number of years 
if we win a contract  and upon expiration the customer requires further services of the type provided by the contract  there is frequently a competitive rebidding process and there can be no assurance that we will win any particular bid  or that we will be able to replace business lost upon expiration or completion of a contract 
as a result of the complexity and scheduling of contracting with government agencies  we occasionally incur costs before receiving contractual funding by the government agency 
in some circumstances  we may not be able to recover these costs in whole or in part under subsequent contractual actions 
if we are unable to consistently retain existing contracts or win new contract awards  our business prospects  financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected 
the us government s increased emphasis on awarding contracts to small businesses could increase the number of contracts we receive as a subcontractor to small businesses and decrease the amount of our revenues from such contracts 
some of these small businesses may not be financially sound  which could adversely affect our business 
there has recently been an increased emphasis by the us government on awarding contracts to small businesses which may preclude companies the size of ours from obtaining certain work  other than as a subcontractor to these small businesses 
there are inherent risks in contracting with small companies that may not have the capability or financial resources to perform these contracts or administer them correctly 
if a small business with which we have a subcontract fails to perform  fails to bill the government properly or fails financially  we may have difficulty receiving timely payments or may incur bad debt write offs if the small business is unable or unwilling to pay us for work we perform 
this could result in significant adverse effects on our revenues  operating costs and cash flows 
government audits of our contracts could result in a material charge to our earnings and have a negative effect on our cash position following an audit adjustment 
many of our government contracts are subject to cost audits which may occur several years after the period to which the audit relates 
if an audit identifies significant unallowable costs  we could incur a material charge to our earnings or reduction in our cash position 
our international business exposes us to additional risks  including exchange rate fluctuations  foreign tax and legal regulations and political or economic instability that could harm our operating results 
our international operations subject us to risks associated with operating in and selling products or services in foreign countries  including devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates  changes in foreign laws that adversely affect our ability to sell our products or services or our ability to repatriate profits to the united states  increases or impositions of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign subsidiaries or joint ventures to us  increases in investment and other restrictions or requirements by foreign governments in order to operate in the territory or own the subsidiary  costs of compliance with local laws  including labor laws  export control regulations and policies which govern our ability to supply foreign customers  unfamiliar and unknown business practices and customs  domestic and foreign government policies  including requirements to expend a portion of program funds locally and governmental industrial cooperation requirements  the complexity and necessity of using foreign representatives and consultants or being prohibited from such use  the uncertainty of the ability of foreign customers to finance purchases  imposition of tariffs or embargoes  export controls and other trade restrictions  the difficulty of management and operation of an enterprise in various countries  and economic and geopolitical developments and conditions  including international hostilities  acts of terrorism and governmental reactions  inflation  trade relationships and military and political alliances 
our foreign subsidiaries generally enter into contracts and make purchase commitments that are denominated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  we are exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates  which could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
we have no control over the factors that generally affect this risk  such as economic  financial and political events and the supply of and demand for applicable currencies 
while we use foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge significant contract sales and purchase commitments that are denominated in foreign currencies  our hedging strategy may not prevent us from incurring losses due to exchange fluctuations 
our operating margins may decline under our fixed price contracts if we fail to accurately estimate the time and resources necessary to satisfy our obligations 
approximately of our revenues in were from fixed price contracts under which we bear the risk of cost overruns 
our profits are adversely affected if our costs under these contracts exceed the assumptions we used in bidding for the contract 
sometimes we are required to fix the price for a contract before the project specifications are finalized  which increases the risk that we will incorrectly price these contracts 
the complexity of many of our engagements makes accurately estimating the time and resources required more difficult 
we may be liable for civil or criminal penalties under a variety of complex laws and regulations  and changes in governmental regulations could adversely affect our business and financial condition 
our businesses must comply with and are affected by various government regulations that impact our operating costs  profit margins and our internal organization and operation of our businesses 
these regulations affect how we do business and  in some instances  impose added costs 
any changes in applicable laws could adversely affect our business and financial performance 
any material failure to comply with applicable laws could result in contract termination  price or fee reductions or suspension or debarment from contracting 
the more significant regulations include the federal acquisition regulations and all department and agency supplements  which comprehensively regulate the formation  administration and performance of us government contracts  the truth in negotiations act and implementing regulations  which require certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations  the international traffic in arms regulations  which control the export and import of defense related articles and services on the united states munitions control list  laws  regulations and executive orders restricting the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the exportation of certain products and technical data  regulations of most state and regional agencies and foreign governments similar to those described above  the foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act  the sarbanes oxley act and the dodd frank act  and tax laws and regulations in the us and in other countries in which we operate 
business disruptions could seriously affect us 
our business may be affected by disruptions including  but not limited to threats to physical security of our facilities and employees  including senior executives  terrorist acts  information technology attacks or failures  damaging weather or other acts of nature  and pandemics or other public health crises 
the costs related to these events may not be fully mitigated by insurance or other means 
disruptions could affect our internal operations or services provided to customers  and could impact our sales  increase our expenses  or adversely affect our reputation or our stock price 
our failure to identify  attract and retain qualified technical and management personnel could adversely affect our existing businesses 
we may not be able to attract or retain highly qualified technical personnel  including engineers  computer programmers and personnel with security clearances required for classified work  or management personnel to supervise such activities that are necessary for maintaining and growing our existing businesses 
our business could be negatively affected by cyber or other security threats or other disruptions 
as a us defense contractor  we face cyber threats  threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees  and terrorist acts  as well as the potential for business disruptions associated with information technology failures  natural disasters  or public health crises 
we routinely experience cyber security threats  threats to our information technology infrastructure and attempts to gain access to our company sensitive information  as do our customers  suppliers  subcontractors and joint venture partners 
we may experience similar security threats at customer sites that we operate and manage as a contractual requirement 
prior cyber attacks directed at us have not had a material impact on our financial results  and we believe our threat detection and mitigation processes and procedures are robust 
due to the evolving nature of these security threats  however  the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted 
although we work cooperatively with our customers and our suppliers  subcontractors  and joint venture partners to seek to minimize the impacts of cyber threats  other security threats or business disruptions  we must rely on the safeguards put in place by those entities 
the costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means 
occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our internal operations  the services we provide to customers  loss of competitive advantages derived from our r d efforts  early obsolescence of our products and services  our future financial results  our reputation or our stock price 
we may incur significant costs in protecting our intellectual property which could adversely affect our profit margins 
our inability to protect our patents and proprietary rights could adversely affect our businesses prospects and competitive positions 
we seek to protect proprietary technology and inventions through patents and other proprietary right protection 
the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
if we are unable to obtain or maintain these protections  we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary rights 
in addition  we may incur significant expense both in protecting our intellectual property and in defending or assessing claims with respect to intellectual property owned by others 
we also rely on trade secrets  proprietary know how and continuing technological innovation to remain competitive 
we have taken measures to protect our trade secrets and know how  including the use of confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and advisors 
these agreements may be breached and remedies for a breach may not be sufficient to compensate us for damages incurred 
we generally control and limit access to our product documentation and other proprietary information 
other parties may independently develop our know how or otherwise obtain access to our technology 
we compete primarily for government contracts against many companies that are larger  better capitalized and better known than us 
if we are unable to compete effectively  our business and prospects will be adversely affected 
our businesses operate in highly competitive markets 
many of our competitors are larger  better financed and better known companies who may compete more effectively than we can 
in order to remain competitive  we must keep our capabilities technically advanced and compete on price and on value added to our customers 
our ability to compete may be adversely affected by limits on our capital resources and our ability to invest in maintaining and expanding our market share 
the terms of our financing arrangements may restrict our financial and operational flexibility  including our ability to invest in new business opportunities 
we currently have unsecured borrowing arrangements 
the terms of these borrowing arrangements include provisions that limit our levels of debt and require minimum levels of net worth and coverage of fixed charges 
we may incur future obligations that would subject us to additional covenants that affect our financial and operational flexibility or subject us to different events of default 
our current million unsecured revolving credit facility expires in may as of september   there were no borrowings under this revolving facility and million of outstanding letters of credit issued under this facility 
our revenues could be less than expected if we are not able to deliver services or products as scheduled due to disruptions in supply 
since our internal manufacturing capacity is limited  we use contract manufacturers 
while we use care in selecting our manufacturers  we have less control over the reliability of supply  quality and price of products or components than if we manufactured them 
in some cases  we obtain products from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
consequently  we risk disruptions in our supply of key products and components if our suppliers fail or are unable to perform because of strikes  natural disasters  financial condition or other factors 
any material supply disruptions could adversely affect our ability to perform our obligations under our contracts and could result in cancellation of contracts or purchase orders  penalties  delays in realizing revenues  payment delays  as well as adversely affect our ongoing product cost structure 
failure to perform by our subcontractors could materially and adversely affect our contract performance and our ability to obtain future business 
our performance of contracts often involves subcontractors  upon which we rely to complete delivery of products or services to our customers 
we may have disputes with subcontractors 
a failure by a subcontractor to satisfactorily deliver products or services can adversely affect our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor 
any subcontractor performance deficiencies could result in the customer terminating our contract for default  which could expose us to liability for excess costs of reprocurement by the customer and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for other contracts 
we may acquire other companies  which could increase our costs or liabilities or be disruptive to our business 
part of our strategy involves the acquisition of other companies 
we may not be able to integrate acquired entities successfully without substantial expense  delay or operational or financial problems 
the acquisition and integration of new businesses involves risk 
the integration of acquired businesses may be costly and may adversely impact our results of operations or financial condition 
as a result we may need to divert management resources to integration  which may adversely affect our ability to pursue other more profitable activities  integration may be difficult as a result of the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations  integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures  we may not be able to eliminate redundant costs anticipated at the time we select acquisition candidates  and one or more of our acquisition candidates may have unexpected liabilities  fraud risk  or adverse operating issues that we fail to discover through our due diligence procedures prior to the acquisition 
unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability 
our business operates in many locations under government jurisdictions that impose taxes based on income and other criteria 
changes in domestic or foreign tax laws and regulations  or their interpretation  could result in higher or lower tax rates assessed  changes in the taxability of certain revenues or activities  or changes in the deductibility of certain expenses  thereby affecting our tax expense and profitability 
in addition  audits by tax authorities could result in unanticipated increases in our tax expense 
our results of operations have historically fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future  which could adversely affect our stock price 
our revenues are affected by factors such as the unpredictability of contract awards due to the long procurement process for most of our products and services  the potential fluctuation of governmental agency budgets  the time it takes for the new markets we target to develop and for us to develop and provide products and services for those markets  competition and general economic conditions 
our contract type product mix and unit volume  our ability to keep expenses within budget and our pricing affect our operating margins 
significant growth in costs to complete our contracts may adversely affect our results of operations in future periods 
these factors and other risk factors described herein may adversely affect our results of operations and cause our financial results to fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis 
consequently  we do not believe that comparison of our results of operations from period to period is necessarily meaningful or predictive of our likely future results of operations 
in some future financial period our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
if so  the market price of our securities may decline significantly

in  the ministry of defense for the armed forces of the islamic republic of iran obtained a judgment from the united states district court for the southern district of california enforcing an arbitration award in its favor against us of million  plus arbitration costs and interest related to a contract awarded to us by iran in both parties appealed to the th circuit court of appeals 
in december  a decision was handed down upholding the arbitration award and requiring the district court to resolve outstanding issues related to the amount of interest to be paid and whether the plaintiff should be awarded attorney s fees 
under a presidential executive order  all transactions by united states citizens with iran are prohibited  however  in april we received a license from the us treasury department allowing us to remit the million owed to the us district court on april   resulting in the cessation of further post judgment interest expense 
we had recorded a liability for the judgment amount in a previous year and had accrued interest through the date of the payment  so there was no impact on earnings other than interest accrued of million 
we are unable to determine whether the us district court will award additional pre judgment interest  which the plaintiff has asserted should be million  or reimbursement to the plaintiff for attorney s fees amounting to million  because these are discretionary with the court 
therefore  we have not recorded a liability for these amounts as of september  the district court heard arguments from both parties on september  and we are awaiting their decision 
in november  we received a claim from a public transit authority customer which alleges that the authority incurred a loss of transit revenue due to the inappropriate and illegal actions of one of our former employees  who has plead guilty to the charges 
this individual was employed to work on a contract we acquired in a business combination in and had allegedly been committing these illegal acts from almost two years prior to our acquisition of the contract  until his arrest in may the transit system was designed and installed by a company unrelated to us 
the claim seeks recoupment from us of the alleged lost revenue and an unspecified amount of fees and damages 
in march  the county superior court in boston  massachusetts entered a default judgment against our former employee and others for million based upon the estimated loss of revenue by the public transit authority customer 
in the quarter ended march   we recorded an accrued cost of million within general and administrative expense in the transportation systems segment based upon the court s assessment of these losses 
we are currently unable to estimate the amount of any other fees or damages related to this matter in excess of the amount that has been recorded through september  insurance may cover all  or a portion  of any losses we could ultimately incur for this matter 
however  any potential insurance proceeds are treated as a gain contingency and will not be recognized in the financial statements until receipt of any such proceeds is assured 
in addition to the matters described above  we are subject to various claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business from time to time  including claims and legal proceedings that have been asserted against us by customers  former employees and competitors 
we have accrued for estimated losses in the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for matters where we believe the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
based on currently available information  management does not believe that the ultimate outcome of these unresolved matters  individually or in the aggregate  are likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations incorporates the restated amounts 
for this reason the data set forth in this section may not be comparable to discussions and data in our previously filed annual and quarterly reports 
overview our primary businesses are in the defense and transportation industries 
for the year ended september   of sales were derived from defense systems and services  while were derived from transportation fare collection systems and other commercial operations 
these include high technology businesses that design  manufacture and integrate complex systems  and provide essential services to meet the needs of various federal and regional government agencies in the us and other nations around the world 
the us government remains our largest customer  accounting for approximately of sales in  compared to in  in and in cubic transportation systems cts develops and delivers innovative fare collection systems for public transit authorities worldwide 
we provide hardware  software and multiagency  multimodal transportation integration technologies  as well as a full scope of operational services that allow the agencies to efficiently collect fares  manage their operations  reduce fare evasion and make using public transit a more convenient and attractive option for commuters 
cubic defense systems cds is focused on two primary lines of business training systems and communications 
the segment is a diversified supplier of live and virtual military training systems  and communication systems and products to the us department of defense  other us government agencies and allied nations 
we design instrumented range systems for fighter aircraft  armored vehicles and infantry force on force live training weapons effects simulations  laser based tactical and communication systems  and precision gunnery solutions 
our communications products are aimed at intelligence  surveillance  and search and rescue markets 
in  through two acquisitions  we added new product lines including multi band communication tracking devices  and cross domain hardware solutions to address multi level security requirements 
mission support services mss is a leading provider of highly specialized support services to the us government and allied nations 
services provided include live  virtual and constructive training  real world mission rehearsal exercises  professional military education  intelligence support  information technology  information assurance and related cyber support  development of military doctrine  consequence management  infrastructure protection and force protection  as well as support to field operations  force deployment and redeployment and logistics 
sales increased in fiscal over  primarily due to growth of in cts 
growth in sales from mss was nearly offset by a decrease in cds sales 
sales increased to billion in  compared to billion in  with all of the growth coming from existing businesses 
the average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the us dollar  resulted in a decrease in sales of million in over sales increased in over  due to growth in all three business segments 
sales grew to billion in  compared to billion in approximately half of the growth in was organic and half was the result of our acquisition of abraxas in december  which added million to our revenue 
sales in would have increased by without the addition of abraxas and sales in our mss segment would have decreased absent this acquisition 
the average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the us dollar resulted in an increase in sales of million in over growth in sales of in over also came from all three business segments 
sales increased to billion in  compared to billion in nearly of the growth in was organic  while the remainder came from the consolidation of transys  a variable interest entity vie  and from two small acquisitions we made during the vie added million to sales  however these sales had no net margin and therefore had no effect on operating income 
sales growth in without consolidation of the vie would have been approximately 
the average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the us dollar  resulted in an increase in sales of million in over see the segment discussions following for further information about segment sales 
operating income increased to million in compared to million in cts and cds each contributed to the growth in operating income in  while mss operating income was down in from growth in cts sales was the primary reason for the increase in operating income  while cds operating income grew primarily due to a decrease in our investment in cross domain and global asset tracking products in compared to the current competitive environment in the government services industry is driving mss profit margins lower than in recent years  resulting in lower operating income 
operating results for mss include an operating loss from abraxas of million in  including amortization of intangible assets of million  compared to a loss of million in  which included amortization of intangible assets of million and acquisition costs of million 
the average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the us dollar  resulted in a decrease in operating income of million for operating income increased to million in compared to million in improved margins and higher sales in our transportation systems segment contributed significantly to the increase in our operating income 
we incurred higher costs in than in on our contract in london for the transition of our contract from the vie to cubic  resulting in higher margins on this contract in operating income growth in was limited somewhat by an increase in the investment by cds in two businesses acquired in that are developing cross domain and global asset tracking products 
the operating losses for these two businesses totaled million in compared to million in mss operating income in was lower than primarily because of an operating loss of million incurred by the newly acquired abraxas business  as mentioned above 
a million gain was recorded by cds in related to the recovery of a receivable that had been reserved for in previous years  which positively impacted our operating income 
the average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the us dollar  resulted in an increase in operating income of million for our operating income increased in to million from million in  with the increase coming primarily from cds 
the operating results of cds for had included a provision for an uncollectable receivable of million  however  in we were able to recover the full amount plus attorney s fees  costs and interest  bringing the total recovery to million 
cts operating income was lower in than in because of costs that were incurred for the transition of our contract in london from the vie to cubic completed in late this transition of the entire contract to cubic is expected to result in higher sales and operating income in subsequent years until completion of the contract in august of the average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the us dollar  resulted in an increase in operating income of million for see the segment discussions following for further information about segment operating income 
net income attributable to cubic increased to million per share in from million per share in  million per share in and million per share in higher net income year over year resulted primarily from the improvements in operating income  as described above 
our net income also increased in and compared to and due to a decrease in our effective tax rate  as described below 
the gross margin from product sales was in  compared to in  in and in improved performance from our transportation systems business in and our defense systems training business in and primarily accounted for the increases over the prior years 
the gross margin from service sales was in compared to in  in and in competitive pressures in the defense services business in contributed to the decrease in gross margin from the increase in gross margins from services in also reflected the improvement in margin and increase in service revenue related to our transportation business in the uk  as well as a higher gross margin from abraxas revenues since our acquisition of the business in december the services gross margin in was lower because of costs we incurred in the transition of our contract in london from the vie to cubic 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased to million or of sales in  compared to million or of sales in  million or of sales in and million or of sales in the increase in sg a expenses in reflects the overall growth of the business 
the increase in was primarily due to increased business development expenses for two defense systems businesses acquired in  as well as increased business development expenses related to other businesses within our defense systems segment 
in  we incurred more bid and proposal costs as a percentage of revenue throughout the organization  and more sg a costs related to the growth of our transportation systems business in australia and the uk the acquisition of abraxas in the mss segment also added to and sg a expenses compared to and in addition  sg a expenses benefitted from a bad debt recovery of million  while sg a expenses included a bad debt provision of million 
company sponsored research and development r d spending totaled million in compared to million in  million in and million in the increase in r d expenditures in came from the transportation systems business  which increased r d spending from million in to million in increased r d expenditures in were primarily related to the development of products by the two defense companies we acquired in  including multi band communication tracking devices and cross domain hardware solutions to address multi level security requirements 
we also increased r d spending in and again in related to new technologies for ground combat training systems in our defense systems business 
a significant portion of our product development spending is incurred in connection with the performance of work on our contracts 
the amount of contract required development activity in was approximately million compared to million in  million in and million in  however  these costs are included in cost of sales  rather than r d  as they are directly related to contract performance 
amortization expense increased to million in  compared to million in  million in and million in the increase in and over and was primarily due to our acquisition of abraxas in december interest and dividend income was million in  compared to million in  million in and million in interest and dividend income primarily increased in and over and due to an increase in local currencies held by our wholly owned subsidiaries in new zealand and australia 
these foreign investments earned a higher interest rate in both and than our other cash and short term investments 
other income expense netted to income of million in  compared to million in  million in and million in the higher amount of other income in and was caused primarily by the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on us dollar denominated investments held by our wholly owned subsidiary in the uk that uses the british pound as its functional currency 
the impact of exchange rates on these us dollar denominated investments was recorded as other non operating income  and resulted in income of million in and million in interest expense was million in  compared to million in  million in and million in due to a reduction in long term borrowings over the four year period 
our effective tax rate for was of pretax income compared to in  in and in our effective tax rate increased in over  primarily because of the expiration of the us r d credit on december  in  we also recorded a benefit of million  due to the reversal of uncertain tax positions relating to statute expirations and settlements with tax authorities  compared to million in  million in and million in the effective tax rate also decreased in and compared to and  due to an increase in the amount of our income earned in foreign tax jurisdictions that is taxed at lower rates than the us federal statutory tax rate 
our effective tax rate also decreased in compared to and due to an increase in r d and other income tax credits 
in addition  in fiscal the us congress retroactively reinstated the r d credit  which had expired in fiscal  further reducing our tax expense by million 
the tax effect of repatriation of earnings from our foreign subsidiaries resulted in additional tax of million in and million in our effective tax rate could be affected in future years by  among other factors  the mix of business between us and foreign jurisdictions  our ability to take advantage of available tax credits and audits of our records by taxing authorities 
transportation systems segment years ended september  in millions as restated as restated as restated transportation systems sales transportation systems operating income cts sales increased to million in compared to million in the overall increase in sales was primarily from work on our contracts in sydney  australia and vancouver  bc canada 
in addition  sales were somewhat higher from our contracts in the uk partially offsetting these increases were lower sales from design and build projects in the us that were completed in the average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the us dollar  resulted in a decrease in sales of million for cts sales increased to million in compared to million in sales increased in europe and australia  but decreased in north america 
the increase in sales came primarily from our contract in vancouver  bc canada  our contracts in the bc and our contracts in sydney and brisbane  australia 
higher sales from our contract in london resulted primarily from the transition of services to cubic under a major contract modification awarded in fiscal  for which full transition of services to cubic was completed in august of these services were formerly performed by our joint venture partner in the transys arrangement 
partially offsetting these increases were lower sales from a gating system contract in southern california  which was completed in  and lower sales in the san francisco bay area 
the average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the us dollar  resulted in an increase in sales of million for cts sales increased in to million from million in sales were higher in from work in the san francisco bay area  our uk contracts  the installation of a gating system in southern california  and from a new contract in sydney  australia 
these increases were partially offset by lower sales from a system installation contract in florida  which was completed early in  and from train operating companies in the uk a portion of the sales increase from the london contract resulted from a major contract modification received in fiscal  which began the transition of services in fiscal to cubic from our joint venture partner in the transys arrangement 
in addition  a portion of the sales increase from the london contract resulted from consolidation of the company s owned subsidiary  transys  beginning in march of this newly consolidated subsidiary added million to sales in the average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the us dollar  resulted in an increase in sales of million for cts operating income improved to million in from million in  an increase of 
improvements in operating income resulted from higher sales in canada and the uk as mentioned above 
in addition  profit margins have improved from a service contract in north america  where we receive higher revenues based on increased system usage 
lower sales in the us from the contracts that were completed in partially offset the growth in operating income  in addition to cost growth of million on contracts in the u 
s and europe 
we also increased research and development spending in to million  compared to million in  which limited growth in operating income 
we are working on next generation transit technologies that we believe will enhance our leading position in the industry 
the average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the us dollar  resulted in a decrease in operating income of million for cts operating income improved to million in from million in  an increase of 
operating income was higher on increased revenue from our contracts in the uk and australia 
the operating margin in australia improved primarily due to a reduction in bid and proposal costs in compared to costs incurred in to secure the sydney contract 
operating income was higher in the uk from our contract in london  due to higher sales and lower costs in than in we had incurred significantly higher costs in to transition services to cubic that were formerly performed by our joint venture partner in the transys arrangement  as mentioned above 
partially offsetting these increases were lower operating income on lower sales from the gating system customer in southern california mentioned above 
in addition  in we received a contract modification that resolved a contingency on a contract in europe  resulting in a reversal of a million reserve that added to operating income in the average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the us dollar  resulted in an increase in operating income of million for operating income from cts decreased in to million from million in we incurred costs in of approximately million to transition services to cubic that were formerly performed by our joint venture partner in the transys arrangement  as mentioned above 
the additional sales from transys did not add to operating income  because transys operated on a break even basis  as it was designed to do 
cost growth of million on a contract in north america also contributed to the decrease in operating income 
partially offsetting these decreases were higher margins on higher sales in north america and higher operating profits from european operations 
a contract modification received in resolved a contingency on a contract in europe  allowing us to reverse a reserve of million that had been recorded in  as mentioned above 
results from european operations for also included a pension curtailment charge of million 
results in had included contract restructuring agreements that added million to operating income and a foreign currency exchange gain that added million 
the average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the us dollar  resulted in a decrease in operating income of million for defense systems segment years ended september  in millions as restated as restated as restated defense systems sales training systems communications other defense systems operating income training systems communications other training systems training systems sales decreased in to million from million in the delivery of air combat training systems to a us government customer in resulted in significantly higher sales than in in addition  sales from a ground combat training system contract in the far east were lower in than in and shipment of miles multiple integrated laser engagement simulation equipment to the us government decreased in compared to partially offsetting these decreases were higher sales of our small arms training systems and higher sales from two ground combat training range contracts in europe 
the average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the us dollar  resulted in an increase in training system sales of million for training systems sales were up for to million from million in higher sales from air combat training  ground combat training and miles equipment all contributed to the increase 
sales of air combat training systems to the us military and to customers in the far east grew in increases in ground combat training system sales in europe more than offset decreases in sales of ground combat training systems to customers in the far east 
the average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the us dollar  resulted in an increase in training system sales of million for training systems sales increased in to million compared to million in sales were higher in from all major product lines  including air and ground combat training systems  miles equipment and small arms training systems 
significant fourth quarter deliveries of air combat training systems to the us military helped to push sales higher for  more than offsetting lower air combat training sales to customers in the far east 
sales were also higher for the year from a ground combat training system contract for a customer in the far east 
the average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the us dollar  resulted in an increase in training system sales of million for operating income for training systems was million in and in and the first half of  we recorded revenues equal to costs on a ground combat training system in europe because we were working under a contract without a firm contract price or scope of work 
in  we reached agreement with the customer on price and scope of work  resulting in additional profit margin this year because of this favorable change in estimate 
an increase in operating income also came from increased sales of small arms training systems 
offsetting these increases were lower operating profits on lower sales of air combat training systems  a ground combat training system in the far east and miles equipment 
in addition  we incurred higher than previously expected costs in developing an instumented training system for the us marine corps in the average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the us dollar  resulted in an increase in training systems operating income of million for operating income for training systems increased to million in compared to million in the growth in operating income was primarily attributable to increased operating income on higher sales of air combat training systems to the us military and to a customer in the far east  and improved margins on increased sales of miles equipment 
the operating income for training systems was positively impacted by a bad debt recovery from a company through which we sold training systems products to the us government 
in the company had failed to pass on to us cash they collected from the government on our behalf 
in  we were able to collect the entire amount plus attorney s fees  costs and interest  for a total recovery of million 
we invested million in and million in in the development of new ground combat training technology for tactical vehicles  which limited our operating income in both years 
the average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the us dollar  resulted in an increase in training systems operating income of million for training systems operating income increased in to million  from million in higher sales and improved profit margins from the ground combat training system in the far east mentioned above added to operating income in  as well as higher sales and improved profit margins from miles equipment 
in addition  in we had established a million allowance for doubtful accounts receivable related to a company through which we sold training systems products to the us government  because they failed to pass on to us cash they collected from the government on our behalf 
as mentioned  in we were able to collect the entire amount plus attorney s fees  costs and interest  for a total recovery in of million 
these improvements were partially offset by lower operating income from lower sales of air combat training systems to customers in the far east where we had realized higher profit margins in in addition  in the fourth quarter of  we invested million in the development of new ground combat training technology for tactical vehicles  which limited growth in our operating income in the average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the us dollar  resulted in an increase in training systems operating income of million for communications communications sales increased slightly to million in from million in sales of personnel locator systems and power amplifiers decreased in  while sales of data links increased 
communications sales decreased to million in from million in sales of data links and power amplifiers decreased in  while sales of personnel locater systems were relatively consistent between the years 
communications sales grew in to million from million in sales were higher in from all three major product lines  including personnel locator systems  data links and power amplifiers 
we began work on a new contract in called video scout and produced spare parts for the joint stars system we delivered years ago  which contributed to the increase in data links sales 
operating income from communications decreased to million in from million in higher data link sales added to operating income  however  this was more than offset by higher than expected costs of developing new data link technology in lower sales of personnel locator systems and power amplifiers also contributed to the decrease 
operating income from communications increased to million in from million in in we realized operating losses of million from a new mini common data link mini cdl product and video scout product as a result of development costs incurred in  compared to profitable sales of these products in communications operating income increased to million in  compared to million in  a increase 
in  higher operating income on higher sales from all three product lines was partially offset by development costs for new products  including video scout and mini cdl 
other in  cds added two new product lines through acquisitions that are developing cross domain and global asset tracking products 
during  we increased our investment in the development and marketing of these products  resulting in an operating loss for the year as reflected in the other caption in the table above 
in  we reduced operating and development costs for these product lines  but again incurred an operating loss 
also included in the other category above were development costs for combat identification technologies 
partially offsetting these expenses was an adjustment of million recorded in that reduced our estimated liability for contingent consideration related to one of the acquisitions made in mission support services segment years ended september  in millions as restated as restated as restated mission support services sales mission support services operating income mss sales were up to million in compared to million in sales were higher from abraxas in  both due to growth of the business and because we acquired the business during the first quarter of and thus did not realize a full year of sales that year 
sales were also higher from our contract at the joint readiness training center jrtc in fort polk  la and from our defense modernization business in eastern europe 
the loss of training work for flight simulators  and at the us army quartermaster center and school  partially offset these sales increases 
the current environment in defense services  including increased competition and an emphasis on small business awards  has limited mss growth and may continue to do so in the near term 
mss sales were up to million in compared to million in our acquisition of abraxas in december added million to sales for sales growth was also driven by increased activity in support of homeland security under our seaport e contract  and in support of instruction and maintenance of flight simulators 
partially offsetting these sales increases were lower sales from the jrtc contract and from the us army quartermaster center and school 
sales also decreased from training and education contracts due to delays in contract awards  as well as services insourcing  primarily by the us army  and the migration of certain contracts to small businesses where we are now in a subcontractor role 
mss sales increased in to million compared to million in increased activity at the jrtc and at the us army quartermaster center and school added to sales in in addition  higher sales from two contracts with the us marine corps and a contract at the joint coalition warfare center jcwc added to the sales total in compared to partially offsetting these improvements in were lower sales from a trainer maintenance contract that we lost to a small business competitor and from a contract for services performed in iraq that had added approximately million to sales in  but was completed 
mss operating income decreased to million in from million in the loss of the contracts mentioned above contributed to lower operating income in in addition  the competitive environment has forced us to bid somewhat lower margins than in recent years in order to acquire positions on new contracts and retain positions on our existing contracts 
the operating loss from abraxas improved to million in  including amortization of intangible assets of million  compared to million in  which included amortization of intangible assets of million and acquisition costs of million 
mss operating income decreased to million in from million in abraxas incurred an operating loss of million for  as mentioned above 
lower revenue from certain higher margin training and education contracts also contributed to the decrease in operating income for these decreases were partially offset by an increase in operating margin on increased sales from certain information operations contracts 
in late and early  mss had recorded a provision of million for a dispute with a customer over contract terms 
as a result of the settlement of this dispute  we recorded a gain of million in mss operating income increased to million in from million in higher operating income on higher sales in from the contracts mentioned above helped to improve operating income in compared to mss operating income was impacted by the reserve recorded for the dispute with a customer over contract terms discussed above by million in and million in the contract in iraq mentioned above  that was completed in  had contributed higher than typical profit margins to operating income in amortization of purchased intangibles included in the mss results amounted to million  million  million and million in   and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities used cash of million in  compared to providing cash of million in  million in and million in in  cash generated by earnings was offset by increases in accounts receivable of million  long term capitalized construction costs of million  and inventories of million  and a net decrease in customer advances of million  which contributed to the overall use of cash for the year 
the growth in accounts receivable and reduction of customer advances related to several large contracts we worked on in  including transportation systems contracts in canada and australia and defense system contracts in the us  far east and middle east 
negative cash flows on these contracts at this stage of their completion is in accordance with contract terms 
in  cash generated by earnings  decreases in accounts receivable of million and inventories of million  and net customer advances of million contributed to the positive results 
in  cash generated by earnings  decreases in accounts receivable of million and inventories of million  and net customer advances of million contributed to the positive cash flows 
in  cash generated by earnings  decreases in accounts receivable of million and net customer advances of million contributed to the positive results 
in  mss contributed positive operating cash flows  while cds and cts both generated negative operating cash flows 
in through  all three segments contributed to positive operating cash flows 
in and  cts provided the greatest portion of the positive cash flows  while in cds provided more than half the positive cash flows 
partially offsetting the positive operating cash flows were payments of million for income taxes in and million in value added tax vat in  related to the wind up of the prestige contract within transys  our owned variable interest entity vie 
cash provided by the consolidation of the vie was the primary source of cash used to make these income tax and vat payments  which are included in operating activities 
we have classified certain unbilled accounts receivable balances as non current because we do not expect to receive payment within one year from the balance sheet date 
at september   this balance was million compared to million at september   million at september  and million at september  investing activities provided cash of million in  and used cash of million in  million in and million in in  net cash provided by investing activities consisted of proceeds of million from maturities of short term investments  offset by capital expenditures of million 
in  cash used in investing activities included million for the acquisition of abraxas  million for a small defense systems acquisition made during the year  and an additional payment of million for a small defense systems acquisition made in in addition  in  we received proceeds from the sale or maturities of short term investments of million and made capital expenditures of million 
in  cash used in investing activities included million of net purchases of short term investments  cash paid for acquisitions of million for two small defense systems acquisitions and an additional payment of million for a transportation systems acquisition made in in  we consolidated transys  our owned vie  which provided million of cash and made capital expenditures of million 
in  two transportation systems acquisitions used million  as well as the final payment of million from a acquisition  purchases of short term investments of million and capital expenditures of million 
financing activities used cash of million in  million in  million in and million in in  we placed million of cash in a restricted bank account as collateral for a letter of credit facility we entered into in the uk we are required to leave the cash in the restricted account as long as the bank continues to maintain the associated letters of credit under the facility 
cash used in financing activities consisted of scheduled payments on long term borrowings of million  million  million and million in   and  respectively 
dividends paid to shareholders amounted to million cents per share  million cents per share  million cents per share and million cents per share in   and  respectively 
we have a committed five year revolving credit agreement with a group of financial institutions in the amount of million  expiring in may commitment fees associated with this financing arrangement are of the unutilized balance per annum 
as of september   there were no borrowings under this agreement  however  there were letters of credit outstanding under the agreement totaling million  which reduce the available line of credit to million 
the accumulated deficit in other comprehensive income loss decreased million in due to a positive adjustment from foreign currency translation of million and an unrealized gain on cash flow hedges of million 
partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in the recorded liability for our pension plans of million after applicable income taxes 
these adjustments resulted in a negative balance in accumulated other comprehensive income of million at september  compared to a negative balance of million at september   million at september and million at september  the net deferred tax assets balance was million  million  million and million at september    and  respectively 
the primary reasons for the increase in was an increase in the asset related to the effect of recording adjustments to our pension liability through other comprehensive income and a decrease in the liability related to identified intangible assets arising from acquisitions 
the increase in the deferred tax asset related to net operating loss carryforwards in a foreign subsidiary during was the result of  and largely offset by  an increase in the deferred tax liability for deferred revenues under that jurisdiction s tax laws 
the deferred tax liability for deferred revenues does not represent amounts related to revenues deferred in our financial statements  but only for purposes of our tax returns 
in we recorded a net deferred tax liability of million in connection with our acquisition of abraxas to reflect the tax impact of the identified intangible assets that will not generate tax deductible amortization expense  net of the future tax benefit of acquired net operating loss carrybacks and carryforwards 
also  net deferred tax liabilities increased by million in due to a change in the tax accounting method for recording service contract revenue in the us the decrease in the deferred tax assets in was partially offset by the effect of recording adjustments to the pension liability through other comprehensive income  which resulted in an additional deferred tax asset of million at september  we expect to generate sufficient taxable income in the future such that the net deferred tax asset will be realized 
our financial condition remains strong with working capital of million and a current ratio of to at september  we expect that cash on hand and our ability to access the debt markets will be adequate to meet our working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
in addition to short term borrowing arrangements we have in new zealand and australia  we have a committed five year credit facility from a group of financial institutions in the us  aggregating million 
this agreement will expire in may as of september   million of this capacity was used for letters of credit  leaving an additional million available 
our total debt to capital ratio at september  was 
in addition  our cash and cash equivalents  including restricted cash  totaled million at september  which exceeded our total debt by million 
our cash is invested primarily in highly liquid bank deposits and government instruments in the us  us  new zealand and australia 
as of september   million of the million of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments was held by our foreign subsidiaries  primarily in the uk  new zealand and australia 
we also had million of restricted cash in the uk at september  if these funds are needed for our operations in the us  we would be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds 
however  we have the intent and ability to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the us and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our us operations 
the following is a schedule of our contractual obligations outstanding as of september  total less than year years years after years in millions long term debt interest payments operating leases deferred compensation quarterly results quarters ended december   and first fiscal quarter consolidated overview sales for the quarter ended december  increased to million from million in the quarter ended december  and million in the quarter ended december  these amounts represented quarter over quarter growth of in the first quarter of fiscal and in the first quarter of fiscal cts sales increased in and in mss sales increased in after decreasing in cds sales decreased in after having increased in see the segment discussions following for further analysis of segment sales 
operating income was million in the first quarter of fiscal compared to million in the first quarter of fiscal and million in the first quarter of fiscal cts operating income increased in and in mss operating income was lower in than and lower in than in cds operating income decreased in after increasing in corporate and other costs for the first quarter of were million compared to million in and million in see the segment discussions following for further analysis of segment operating income 
net income attributable to cubic for the first quarter of fiscal was million  or cents per share  compared to million  or cents per share in and million or cents per share in net income increased in and over the prior year due primarily to the increases in operating income 
included in other income was a net foreign currency exchange gain of million in the first quarter of fiscal compared to a loss of million in the first quarter of fiscal and a gain of million in the first quarter of fiscal  before applicable income taxes 
these increases were partially offset by the increase in income tax expense described below 
our gross margin percentage on product sales decreased to in the first quarter of compared to in the first quarter of and in the first quarter of the decrease in our gross margin percentage on product sales in is primarily due to cost growth on two cts design and build contracts  one in north america and one in europe  totaling million and a lower gross margin from cds contracts in the far east and europe 
the increase in gross margin in the first quarter of over was primarily due to higher gross margins on a ground combat training contract in the far east 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased in the first quarter of to million compared to million in and million in as a percentage of sales  sg a expenses were for the first quarter of compared to in and in the decrease in was due primarily to lower selling costs in the cds and mss segments  while the increase in was primarily because of higher selling costs in these segments compared to in addition  sg a expenses in the first quarter of included million of costs related to the abraxas acquisition 
company funded research and development expenditures  which mainly relate to new defense technologies we are developing  decreased to million for the first quarter of compared to million in and million in amortization of purchased intangibles increased in the first quarter of to million compared to million in the first quarter of and million in the first quarter of due to the acquisition of abraxas 
the tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal was compared to for the first three months of and for the first three months of in the quarter ended december  the us congress reinstated the research and development r d credit  which had expired in december  resulting in a lower effective rate in the first quarter of fiscal and than in in addition  the income tax rate in the first quarter of further benefitted from the retroactive reinstatement of the federal r d credit  which reduced the tax provision by million in that quarter 
the tax rate in the first quarter of fiscal was also higher because a higher percentage of the income in fiscal was forecast to be from the us  where the tax rate is higher than in foreign jurisdictions 
transportation systems segment cts three months ended december  in millions as restated as restated as restated transportation systems segment sales transportation systems segment operating income cts sales increased in the first quarter of to million compared to million in  which represented a increase over first quarter sales of million 
sales were higher in from work on contracts in australia  a contract in canada  and our contracts in the uk partially offsetting these increases were lower sales from design and build projects in the us compared to the first quarter of sales were higher in than in from work on contracts in australia and our contracts in the uk in late  we completed the transition of services to cubic under a major contract modification awarded in fiscal these services were formerly performed by our joint venture partner in the transys arrangement 
partially offsetting these increases were lower sales from design and build projects in north america compared to the first quarter of the average exchange rates between the prevailing currency in our foreign operations and the us dollar  did not have a material impact on sales when comparing exchange rates in the first quarter of to the first quarter of or when comparing the first quarter of to operating income from cts increased in the first quarter of to million  compared to million in and million in higher sales from contracts in canada and the uk  in addition to improved margins from a service contract in north america contributed to the increase in partially offsetting these increases was cost growth of million related to contracts in the us and europe 
in addition  profit margins were lower in than in because the growth in sales came largely from new contracts that are at an early stage of development  realizing lower margins than our other  more mature  contracts 
in  the profit improvement over came primarily from our contracts in the uk in  we incurred higher costs on our london contract to transition services from our joint venture partner in the transys arrangement  as mentioned above 
this transition was completed in late  resulting in a higher profit margin from the contract in than in the average exchange rates between the prevailing currency in our foreign operations and the us dollar  did not have a material impact on operating income when comparing exchange rates in the first quarter of to the first quarter of or when comparing the first quarter of to defense systems segment cds three months ended december  in millions as restated as restated as restated defense systems segment sales training systems communications other defense systems segment operating income training systems communications other training systems training systems sales decreased in the first quarter of to million compared to million in the first quarter of  after having increased in from million in the first quarter of in the first quarter of  a delivery of air combat training systems to a us government customer resulted in significant additional sales for the quarter 
ground combat training sales in the us and the far east were also lower for the first quarter of compared to partially offsetting these decreases in the first quarter of were higher air combat training sales to a customer in the far east and higher ground combat training sales on a contract with a customer in europe 
in the first quarter of both and we recorded revenues equal to costs on this ground combat training contract because we were working under a contractual arrangement without a firm contract price or scope of work 
in addition to higher sales in the first quarter of compared to from air combat training systems  sales were higher from the delivery of engagement skills trainers 
the average exchange rates between the prevailing currency in our foreign operations  and the us dollar  did not have a material impact on sales when comparing exchange rates in the first quarter of to the first quarter of in  average exchange rates in our foreign operations and the us dollar  resulted in an increase in sales of million for the first quarter compared to the same periods in operating income was down for the first quarter of to million from million in operating income for the first quarter of was higher than the million operating income in the first quarter of lower sales in of air combat training systems in the us and ground combat training systems in the us and far east primarily caused the decrease from the first quarter of  in addition to a lower profit margin from contracts in the far east and europe 
the lower margin was partially caused by the ground combat training system contract where we recorded sales equal to costs  as described above 
higher sales in from these same contracts primarily accounted for the increase over  in addition to higher sales of engagement skills trainers 
the profit margin also benefited from a higher profit margin from the ground combat training contract in the far east due to a favorable change in estimate 
the average exchange rates between the prevailing currency in our foreign operations  and the us dollar  did not have a material impact on operating income when comparing exchange rates in the first quarter of to the first quarter of in  average exchange rates in our foreign operations and the us dollar  resulted in an increase in operating income of million for the first quarter of compared to the same period in communications communications sales increased in the first quarter of to million from million in and million in operating income increased to million in the first quarter of from million in  after decreasing in from million in sales and operating income were higher in than in from all three product lines  including a higher profit margin from data links 
sales and operating income in were higher for the quarter from data links but were lower from the higher margin personnel locator systems and power amplifiers when compared to other included in other are businesses that are developing cross domain and global asset tracking products 
in the first three months we continued to invest in the development and marketing of these products  resulting in an operating loss for the quarter

sales growth in was also driven by increased activity in support of instruction and maintenance of flight simulators 
partially offsetting these sales improvements was a decrease in activity during the first quarter of at the joint readiness training center jrtc in fort polk  la  from a contract at the us army s quartermaster center and school  and from other training and education contracts 
in the first quarter of  activity at the jrtc in fort polk  la

the effective tax rate for the first half of increased from  also resulting in lower net income in the first six months of compared to the effective tax rate in the first half of dropped from the rate in  helping to increase net income for the first half of these changes in tax rates related primarily to changes in the availability of the us r d credit 
the gross margin percentage on product sales decreased to in the first six months of fiscal compared to in and in the decrease in our gross margin percentage on product sales is primarily due to the growth in sales on new cts design and build contracts that are in an early stage of development and are realizing lower margins than our other  more mature  cts contracts and due to cost growth on two cts design and build contracts  one in north america and one in europe  totaling million for the first half of our gross margin percentage on service sales was in the six month periods ended march  and compared to for the first six months of in  cts incurred higher costs on our contract in london  to transition services to cubic from our joint venture partner in the transys arrangement 
sg a expenses increased in the second quarter of to million compared to million in and million in for the six month period  sg a increased to million in compared to million in and million in the primary reason for the increase in was a million provision made for a legal claim in the transportation segment during the second quarter 
the increase in sg a over was primarily because of higher selling costs in the cds and mss segments 
in addition  sga expenses in the first half of included million of costs related to the abraxas acquisition 
as a percentage of sales  sg a expenses were for the first half of fiscal and compared to in fiscal company funded r d expenditures  which relate to new transportation and defense technologies we are developing  increased to million for the second quarter compared to million in and million in for the six month period r d expenditures were million compared to million in and million in amortization of purchased intangibles increased for the six month period in to million compared to million in and million in  due to the acquisition of abraxas in december our effective tax rate for the first half of fiscal was compared to in and in the projected effective rate for fiscal was higher than in primarily due to the expiration of the us federal research and development r d credit on december  in addition  our projected effective income tax rate for the first half of benefitted from the retroactive reinstatement of the federal r d credit  which reduced the tax provision by million in that period 
the tax rate in the first half of fiscal was also higher because a higher percentage of the income in fiscal was forecast to be from the us where the tax rate is higher than in foreign jurisdictions transportation systems segment cts six months ended march  three months ended march  in millions in millions as restated as restated as restated as restated as restated as restated transportation systems segment sales transportation systems segment operating income cts sales increased in the second quarter of to million compared to million in  which represented a increase over second quarter sales of million 
for the six month period  sales increased to million from million in  which had increased over first half sales of million 
sales for the quarter and the six month period ended march   were higher from work on contracts in australia  a contract in canada  and our contracts in the uk partially offsetting these increases were lower sales from design and build projects in the us compared to the second quarter and six month period last year 
in  sales were higher from work on contracts in australia and the uk in late  we completed the transition of services to cubic under a major contract modification awarded in fiscal for our contract in london 
these services were formerly performed by our joint venture partner in the transys arrangement 
partially offsetting these increases were lower sales from design and build projects in north america compared to the second quarter and first six months of last year 
the average exchange rates between the prevailing currency in our foreign operations  and the us dollar  resulted in an increase in sales of million for the second quarter of and million for the six month period  compared to the same periods in in  average exchange rates between the prevailing currency in our foreign operations and the us dollar  resulted in an increase in sales of million for the second quarter of and million for the six month period  compared to operating income from cts decreased in the second quarter of to million compared to million in  which represented a increase over operating income of million in in the second quarter of we recorded a million provision related to a claim against us  for which we are seeking insurance reimbursement 
any potential insurance recovery is treated as a contingent gain until we are assured of receiving the insurance proceeds 
in addition  operating income for the second quarter of was impacted by higher r d spending in than in and cost growth on contracts in the us and europe that reduced operating income by million for the quarter 
higher sales and operating income from contracts in canada and the uk  in addition to improved margins from a service contract in north america in partially offset these decreases for the quarter compared to in the second quarter of  the profit improvement over came primarily from our contract in london 
in we incurred higher costs on the contract to transition services from our joint venture partner in the transys arrangement  as mentioned above 
this transition was completed in late  resulting in a higher profit margin from the contract in than in in the second quarter of  operating income also increased on higher sales volume and reduced proposal related costs compared to what we had incurred in in pursuing a contact in sydney  australia 
in addition  in the second quarter of we received a contract modification that resolved a contingency on a contract in europe  resulting in a reversal of a million reserve that added to operating income 
also in the second quarter of  we completed the installation of a gating system in southern california  which added to operating income

partially offsetting these improvements was the million claim provision mentioned above and cost growth on contracts in the us and europe that reduced operating income by million for the six month period 
we also increased r d spending in over for the first half of  profit improvement over came primarily from our uk contracts  for the reason described above

a delivery of air combat training systems to a us government customer in resulted in significantly higher sales for the quarter and six month period  compared to both and ground combat training sales in the us and the far east were also lower in for the quarter and the six month periods 
in addition  we continued to record revenues equal to costs on a ground combat training system in europe in because we were working under a contract without a firm contract price or scope of work 
partially offsetting these decreases in the quarter and six month periods of were higher sales from new ground combat training systems contracts 
in addition to the air combat training systems sales mentioned above  sales were also higher in the second quarter and first six months  from a ground combat training system we are building for a customer in the far east  from small arms training systems  and from miles multiple integrated laser engagement simulation equipment 
these increases for the six month period in were partially offset by lower sales from a ground combat training system in the middle east 
the average exchange rates between the prevailing currency in our foreign operations and the us dollar  resulted in an increase in sales of million for the second quarter of and million for the six month period  compared to the same periods in in  average exchange rates between the prevailing currency in our foreign operations  and the us dollar  resulted in an increase in sales of million for the second quarter of and million for the six month period  compared to operating income was down for the second quarter to million in from million in  which was higher than second quarter of operating income of million 
for the six month period  operating income decreased to million from million in  after increasing in the first half of from million in lower sales in of higher margin air and ground combat training systems to customers in the far east  and lower sales of ground combat training systems in the us were the primary cause of the decreased profitability in the second quarter and first half of operating income in was also impacted by the ground combat training system contract in europe where we recorded sales equal to costs  as described above 
the large shipment of air combat training systems in did not have a significant impact on comparability of operating income between the periods as the profit margin on these sales was low 
in  higher small arms training and miles sales contributed to the increase in operating income over  in addition to higher sales and improved margins from a ground combat training contract in the far east 
in the second quarter of we collected million of a receivable we had reserved for in  adding to operating income for the quarter and first six months of the average exchange rates between the prevailing currency in our foreign operations and the us dollar  resulted in an increase in operating income of million for the second quarter and the six month period  compared to the same periods in in  average exchange rates between the prevailing currency in our foreign operations and the us dollar  resulted in an increase in operating income of million for the second quarter of and million for the six month period  compared to communications communications sales decreased in the second quarter of to million compared to million in  after decreasing in the second quarter of from million in for the six month period sales increased in to million from million in  which was lower than sales of million 
higher sales of power amplifiers for the six month period in was partially offset by lower sales of personnel locater systems 
in  sales of personnel locater systems increased in the second quarter  but this was more than offset by lower sales of data links and power amplifiers for the quarter and six month period  when compared to operating income decreased in the second quarter of  to million from million in  which had decreased from million in for the first half of  operating income increased to million from million in  which had decreased from operating income of million 
lower profit margins on lower data links and personnel locater system sales contributed to the decrease for the second quarter of  while higher margins on data links sales and higher power amplifier sales contributed to the increase in operating income for the first half of in  lower sales of power amplifiers was the primary cause of lower operating income for the second quarter and first half of the year 
other the other category of the defense systems segment includes businesses that are developing cross domain and global asset tracking products 
in the first six months of we continued to invest in the development and marketing of these products  resulting in an operating loss for the quarter and six month period

sales increased for the six month period to million in from million in  after increasing from sales of million in sales growth for the six month period of was driven by the acquisition of abraxas in december  which added million to sales in compared to million in abraxas sales for the second quarter of were million higher than in the second quarter of sales decreased for the second quarter and six month period from training and education contracts due to the migration of certain contracts to small businesses where we are now in a subcontractor role 
in addition  earlier in we lost a contract in a competitive bid situation  for support of simulation trainers that we had performed for several years 
in  the acquisition of abraxas added million to sales in the second quarter and million for the six month period 
sales growth in was also driven by increased activity in support of homeland security  under our seaport e contract  and in support of the us army in afghanistan 
partially offsetting these sales improvements were lower sales from training and education contracts due to delays in contract awards  and services insourcing by the us government 
mss operating income decreased to million in the second quarter of from million in  and decreased in from million in operating income decreased for the six month period to million in compared to million in  which was lower than operating income of million in the first half of lower sales from certain higher margin training and education contracts contributed to the decrease in operating income for the quarter and six month period in both and in addition  the current competitive environment in the government services industry is driving profit margins somewhat lower than in recent years  especially on contracts where we must compete for task orders on a regular basis 
abraxas incurred an operating loss of million for the second quarter this year compared to an operating loss of million in abraxas operating loss for the six month period ended march  decreased to million from million in the first half of abraxas operating results included million of amortization of intangible assets for the second quarter of compared to million in abraxas recorded million of amortization for the six month period ended march  while amortization and acquisition related costs were million and million  respectively  in the comparable period of liquidity and capital resources operating activities used cash of million for the first six months of  and provided cash of million and million in the first half of and  respectively 
increases in accounts receivable and inventories and decreases in other current liabilities and customer advances contributed to the use of cash in use of cash by cts and cda was partially offset by positive cash flows from mss 
a significant portion of the cash used was in the transportation segment for expenditures related to large contracts in australia and canada where we must meet certain milestones before being paid by the customer

in the third quarter of  we had a significant boost to sales and operating income in the cds segment from a significant delivery of virtual small arms training systems to a us government customer 
however  in  the deliveries of these systems occurred throughout the year  resulting in sales and operating income more evenly spread across the quarters 
the third quarter of also included a large equipment sale in the cts segment  adding to sales and operating income for the quarter 
this was a unique event  as product sales from cts usually come from the development of systems over a period of time  resulting in the revenue spread over the period of performance 
for the first nine months of the fiscal year  sales increased to million compared to million in  an increase of

in addition to the amounts identified above  we have been selected as a participant in  or  in some cases  the sole contractor for several substantial indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts 
idiq contracts are not included in backlog until an order is received 
we also have several service contracts in our transportation business that include contingent revenue provisions tied to meeting certain performance criteria

recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs  which amends accounting standards codification asc topic  fair value measurement 
asu clarified the intent about the application of existing fair value measurement requirements and changed certain requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
we adopted asu in the quarter ended march  this adoption had no material impact to our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other  which amends the existing guidance on goodwill impairment testing 
the new standard allows an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if this is the case  the entity will need to perform a more detailed two step goodwill impairment test which is used to identify potential goodwill impairments and to measure the amount of goodwill impairment losses to be recognized  if any 
the standard is effective for annual or interim goodwill impairment tests performed by us after december   and did not have an effect on our measurement for potential goodwill impairment 
in june  the fasb issued asu  presentation of comprehensive income  which eliminates the option to present other comprehensive income oci in the statement of shareholders equity and instead requires net income  the components of oci  and total comprehensive income to be presented in either one continuous statement or two separate but consecutive statements 
the standard also requires that items reclassified from oci to net income be presented on the face of the financial statements 
the new standard will be effective for us beginning in the quarter ending december  and will be applied retrospectively 
the adoption of the new standard will not have an effect on our results of operations  financial position  or cash flows as it only requires a change in the presentation of oci in our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments our consolidated financial statements are based on the application of us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and any such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the estimates set forth below may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than our other accounting estimates and represent the critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we believe our judgments related to these accounting estimates are appropriate 
however  if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the results could be materially different from the amounts recorded 
revenue recognition a significant portion of our business is derived from long term development  production and system integration contracts 
we consider the nature of these contracts  and the types of products and services provided  when we determine the proper accounting for a particular contract 
generally  we record revenue for long term fixed price contracts on a percentage of completion basis using the cost to cost method to measure progress toward completion 
many of our long term fixed price contracts require us to deliver quantities of products over a long period of time or to perform a substantial level of development effort in relation to the total value of the contract 
under the cost to cost method of accounting  we recognize revenue based on a ratio of the costs incurred to the estimated total costs at completion 
for certain other long term  fixed price production contracts not requiring substantial development effort we use the units of delivery percentage of completion method as the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract and recognizing sales 
the units of delivery measure recognizes revenues as deliveries are made to the customer generally using unit sales values in accordance with the contract terms 
we estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract based on deliveries 
as a general rule  we recognize sales and profits earlier in a production cycle when we use the cost to cost method of percentage of completion accounting than when we use the units of delivery method 
in addition  our profits and margins may vary materially depending on the types of long term contracts undertaken  the costs incurred in their performance  the achievement of other performance objectives  and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees  particularly under award and incentive fee contracts  is finally determined 
award fees and incentives related to performance on contracts  which are generally awarded at the discretion of the customer  as well as penalties related to contract performance  are considered in estimating sales and profit rates 
estimates of award fees are based on actual awards and anticipated performance 
incentive provisions that increase or decrease earnings based solely on a single significant event are generally not recognized until the event occurs 
those incentives and penalties are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance 
accounting for long term contracts requires judgment relative to assessing risks  estimating contract revenues and costs  and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues 
due to the scope and nature of the work required to be performed on many of our contracts  the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables 
contract costs include material  labor and subcontracting costs  as well as an allocation of indirect costs 
for contracts with the us federal government  general and administrative costs are considered contract costs  however  general and administrative costs are not considered contract costs for any other customers 
we have to make assumptions regarding labor productivity and availability  the complexity of the work to be performed  the availability of materials  estimated increases in wages and prices for materials  performance by our subcontractors  and the availability and timing of funding from our customer  among other variables 
for contract change orders  claims  or similar items  we apply judgment in estimating the amounts and assessing the potential for realization 
these amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable 
based upon our history  we believe we have the ability to make reasonable estimates for these items 
we have accounting policies and controls in place to address these  as well as other contractual and business arrangements to properly account for long term contracts  and we continue to monitor and improve such policies  controls  and arrangements 
for other information on such policies  controls and arrangements  see our discussion in item a of this form k 
products and services provided under long term  fixed price contracts represented approximately of our net sales for because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes  it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if our underlying circumstances were to change 
for example  if underlying assumptions were to change such that our estimated profit rate at completion for all fixed price contracts accounted for under the cost to cost percentage of completion method was higher or lower by one percentage point  our net earnings would have increased or decreased by approximately million 
when adjustments in estimated contract revenues or estimated costs at completion are required  any changes from prior estimates are recognized by recording adjustments in the current period for the inception to date effect of the changes on current and prior periods using the cumulative catch up method of accounting 
when estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of revenue to be earned  a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period the loss is determined 
we occasionally enter into contracts that include multiple deliverables such as the construction or upgrade of a system and subsequent services related to the delivered system 
recently we have seen an increase in the number of customer requests for proposal that include this type of contractual arrangement 
an example of this is a contract we entered into in to provide system upgrades and long term services for the vancouver  bc canada smart card and faregate system 
we elected to adopt updated authoritative accounting guidance for multiple element arrangements in on a prospective basis 
for contracts of this nature entered into in and beyond  the contract value is allocated at the inception of the contract to the different contract elements based on their relative selling price 
the relative selling price for each deliverable is determined using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price or third party evidence of selling price if vsoe does not exist 
if neither vsoe nor third party evidence exists  which is typically the case for our contracts  we use our best estimate of the selling price for each deliverable 
once the contract value is allocated to the separate deliverables  revenue recognition guidance relevant to each contractual element is followed 
for example  for the long term construction portion of a contract we use the cost to cost percentage of completion method and for the services portion we recognize the service revenues on a straight line basis over the contractual service period or based on measurable units of work performed or incentives earned 
the judgment we apply in allocating the relative selling price to each deliverable can have a significant impact on the timing of recognizing revenues and operating income on a contract 
changes in estimates on contracts for which revenue is recognized using the cost to cost percentage of completion method increased operating profit by approximately million in  million in  million in  and million in these adjustments increased net income by approximately million per share in  million per share in  million per share in  and million per share in we provide services under contracts including outsourcing type arrangements and operations and maintenance contracts 
revenue under our service contracts with the u 
s 
government  which is generally in our mss segment  is recorded under the cost to cost percentage of completion method 
award fees and incentives related to performance on services contracts at mss are generally accrued during the performance of the contract based on our historical experience with such awards 
revenue under contracts for services other than those with the us government and those associated with design  development  production  or maintenance activities is recognized either as services are performed or when a contractually required event has occurred  depending on the contract 
these types of service contracts are entered primarily by our cts segment and to a lesser extent by our cds segment 
revenue under such contracts is generally recognized on a straight line basis over the period of contract performance  unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned or the obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern 
costs incurred under these services contracts are expensed as incurred 
earnings related to services contracts may fluctuate from period to period  particularly in the earlier phases of the contract 
incentive fees included in some of our transportation systems service contracts are recognized when they become fixed and determinable based on the provisions of the contract 
often these fees are based on meeting certain contractually required service levels or based on system usage levels 
more than half of our total sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the us government 
cost based pricing is determined under the federal acquisition regulation far 
the far provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services under us government contracts 
for example  costs such as those related to charitable contributions  interest expense and certain advertising activities are unallowable and  therefore  not recoverable through sales 
we closely monitor compliance with  and the consistent application of  our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting 
business segment personnel evaluate our contracts through periodic contract status and performance reviews 
corporate management and our internal auditors also monitor compliance with our revenue recognition policies and review contract status with segment personnel 
costs incurred and allocated to contracts are reviewed for compliance with us government regulations by our personnel  and are subject to audit by the defense contract audit agency 
for other information on accounting policies we have in place for recognizing sales and profits  see our discussion under revenue recognition in note to the financial statements 
income taxes significant judgment is required in determining our income tax provisions and in evaluating our tax return positions 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe it is more likely than not a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return  if examined  would be challenged and that we may not prevail 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the outcomes of tax audits 
tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements and are referred to as timing differences 
in addition  some expenses are not deductible on our tax return and are referred to as permanent differences 
timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the benefit in our consolidated statement of income 
we establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent deductions we have taken on our tax return but have not yet recognized as expense in our financial statements or income we have recorded in our financial statements that is deferred to a future period 
we have not recognized any united states tax expense on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries since we intend to reinvest the earnings outside the us for the foreseeable future and therefore no amounts of undistributed earnings are available for distribution 
these undistributed earnings totaled approximately million at september  annually we evaluate the capital requirements in our foreign subsidiaries and determine the amount of excess capital  if any  that is available for distribution 
whether or not we actually repatriate the excess capital in the form of a dividend  we would provide for us taxes on the amount determined to be available for distribution 
this evaluation is judgmental in nature and  therefore  the amount of us taxes provided on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries is affected by these judgments 
purchased intangibles we generally fund acquisitions using cash on hand 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with an acquisition are recorded at their fair values determined by management as of the date of acquisition 
the excess of the transaction consideration over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
we amortize intangible assets acquired as part of business combinations over their estimated useful lives unless their useful lives are determined to be indefinite 
for certain business combinations  we utilize independent valuations to assist us in estimating the fair value of purchased intangibles 
our purchased intangibles primarily relate to contracts and programs acquired and customer relationships  which are amortized over periods of years or less 
the determination of the value and useful life of purchased intangibles is judgmental in nature and  therefore  the amount of annual amortization expense we record is affected by these judgments 
for example  if the weighted average amortization period for our purchased intangibles was one year less than we have determined  our amortization expense would have increased by approximately million 
valuation of goodwill we evaluate our recorded goodwill balances for potential impairment annually as of july  or when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value  including recorded goodwill 
we have not yet had a case where the carrying value exceeded the fair value  however  if it did  impairment would be measured by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying value  and any impairment determined would be recorded in the current period 
to date there has been no impairment of our recorded goodwill 
goodwill balances by reporting unit are as follows september  in millions mission support services defense systems transportation systems total goodwill determining the fair value of a reporting unit for purposes of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and involves the use of estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and market multiples from publically traded comparable companies 
these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows  discount rate reflecting the inherent risk in future cash flows  perpetual growth rate and determination of appropriate market comparables 
for fiscal year  the discounted cash flows for each reporting unit were based on discrete three year financial forecasts developed by management for planning purposes 
cash flows beyond the three year discrete forecasts were estimated based on projected growth rates and financial ratios  influenced by an analysis of historical ratios and by calculating a terminal value at the end of five years for our defense systems and mission support services reporting units  and three years for our transportation systems reporting unit 
the future cash flows were discounted to present value using a discount rate of for our defense systems reporting unit  for our mission support services reporting unit and for our transportation systems reporting unit 
the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its carrying value and  accordingly  there was no indication that goodwill was impaired as of july  changes in estimates and assumptions we make in conducting our goodwill assessment could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period 
however  the fair value of our reporting units would remain in excess of their respective carrying values even if there were a decrease in their fair value at july  pension costs the measurement of our pension obligations and costs is dependent on a variety of assumptions used by our actuaries 
these assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to plan participants  taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience 
these assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions 
the assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors discount rates inflation salary growth expected return on plan assets retirement rates mortality rates the discount rate represents the interest rate that is used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle pension obligations 
we base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on high quality corporate long term bonds 
our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators 
the salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience in relation to the inflation assumption 
the expected return on plan assets reflects asset allocations  our historical experience  our investment strategy and the views of investment managers and large pension sponsors 
mortality rates are based on published mortality tables 
retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience 
the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods 
changes in the above assumptions can affect our financial statements  although the relatively small size of our defined benefit pension plans limits the impact any individual assumption changes would have on earnings 
for example  if the assumed rate of return on pension assets was basis points higher or lower than we have assumed  our net earnings would have increased or decreased by approximately million  assuming all other assumptions were held constant 
holding all other assumptions constant  an increase or decrease of basis points in the discount rate assumption for would increase or decrease net earnings for by approximately million  and would have decreased or increased the amount of the benefit obligation recorded at september   by approximately million 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk we invest in money market instruments and short term marketable debt securities whose return is tied to short term interest rates being offered at the time the investment is made 
we maintain short term borrowing arrangements in the us  australia and new zealand which are also tied to short term rates the us prime rate  the australia bank bill swap bid rate and the new zealand base rate 
we also have senior unsecured notes payable to insurance companies that are due in annual installments 
these notes have fixed coupon interest rates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
interest income earned on our short term investments is affected by changes in the general level of interest rates in the us  the us  australia and new zealand 
these income streams are generally not hedged 
interest expense incurred under the short term borrowing arrangements is affected by changes in the general level of interest rates in the us  australia and new zealand 
the expense related to these cost streams is usually not hedged since it is either revolving  payable within three months and or immediately callable by the lender at any time 
interest expense incurred under the long term notes payable is not affected by changes in any interest rate because it is fixed 
however  we may in the future use an interest rate swap to essentially convert this fixed rate into a floating rate for some or all of the long term debt outstanding 
the purpose of a swap would be to tie the interest expense risk related to these borrowings to the interest income risk on our short term investments  thereby mitigating our net interest rate risk 
we believe that we are not significantly exposed to interest rate risk at this point in time 
we intend to obtain financing in the future in order to finance a transportation contract with a customer for which we will incur significant costs prior to receiving payments under the contract 
in order to mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates prior to obtaining this financing  we have entered into a forward starting swap to reduce interest rate variability exposure for the projected interest rate cash flows 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
foreign currency exchange risk in the ordinary course of business  we enter into firm sale and purchase commitments denominated in many foreign currencies 
we have a policy to hedge those commitments greater than  by using foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary responsible for the commitment  typically the british pound  canadian dollar  singapore dollar  euro  swedish krona  new zealand dollar and australian dollar 
these contracts are designed to be effective hedges regardless of the direction or magnitude of any foreign currency exchange rate change  because they result in an equal and opposite income or cost stream that offsets the change in the value of the underlying commitment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our foreign currency translation and transaction accounting policies 
we also use balance sheet hedges to mitigate foreign exchange risk 
this strategy involves incurring british pound denominated debt see interest rate risk above and having the option of paying off the debt using us dollar or british pound funds 
we believe that our hedging activities limit our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk at this point in time 
investments in our foreign subsidiaries in the uk  australia  new zealand and canada are not hedged because we consider them to be invested indefinitely 
in addition  we generally have control over the timing and amount of earnings repatriation  if any  and expect to use this control to mitigate foreign currency exchange risk
