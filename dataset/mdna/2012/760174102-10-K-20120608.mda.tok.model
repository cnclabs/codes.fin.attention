item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview we have two operating divisions within our corporate structure and  accordingly  we report certain financial information by individual segment under this structure 
our advanced media and information ami operating division includes our media measurement services 
our home entertainment he operating division includes our distribution services as well as services that measure  aggregate and report consumer rental activity on film and video game product from traditional brick and mortar  online and kiosk retailers 
our ami division encompasses media measurement services across multiple screens and platforms and is delivered via web based products within our entertainment essentials lines of business 
these services  offered primarily on a recurring subscription basis  capture consumer viewing data  which is integrated with consumer segmentation and purchase behavior databases 
we provide film studios  television networks and stations  cable  satellite and telecommunications company telco operators  advertisers and advertising agencies insights into consumer viewing and purchasing patterns through our thorough and expansive databases of box office results and local  national and on demand television performance 
our he division services incorporate a unique set of applications designed to help clients maintain and direct their business practices relating to home video products 
entertainment content is distributed to various retailers primarily on behalf of motion picture studios 
we track and report performance of home entertainment products leased directly to video retailers or through our pay per transaction ppt system 
within this system  video retailers participating retailers are given access to a wide selection of box office hits  independent releases and foreign films from the industry s leading suppliers program suppliers on a revenue sharing basis 
by providing second and third tier retailers the opportunity to acquire new inventory in the same manner as major national chains  our ppt system enables retailers everywhere  regardless of size  to increase both the depth and breadth of their inventory  better satisfy consumer demand and more effectively compete in the marketplace 
we lease product from our program suppliers  participating retailers sublease that product from us and rent it to consumers 
participating retailers then share a portion of the revenue from each retail rental transaction with us and we share a portion of the revenue with the program suppliers 
our ppt system supplies both content providers and retailers with the intelligence and infrastructure necessary to make revenue sharing a viable and productive option 
our he division also includes our rental studio direct revenue sharing drs services  which grants content providers constant  clear feedback and data  plus valuable checks and balances on how both their video products and retailers are performing 
data relating to rented entertainment content is received on physical product under established agreements on a fee for service basis 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  digital download essentials and home entertainment essentials was moved from the he division to the ami division effective april  as a result of a change in our internal management reporting structure 
as a result  all prior periods have been restated to reflect this change 
also during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reorganized our international offices and incurred costs of million  which are included in selling and administrative costs on our consolidated statements of operations 
as a result of this reorganization  we expect improved results from our foreign operations 
see forward looking statements on page ami division our media measurement services  offered primarily on a recurring subscription basis  are distributed to clients through patent pending software systems and business processes  and capture data and other intelligence viewed on multiple screens across various platforms within the entertainment  television and advertising industries 
our current spending  investments and long term strategic planning are heavily focused on the development  growth and expansion of our ami division  both domestically and internationally 
as such  we continue to allocate significant resources to our entertainment essentials services and product lines 
our ami division revenue increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal 
table of contents the ami division lines of business are box office essentials  ondemand essentials  and related ondemand everywhere products  and tv essentials  which includes stationview essentials 
typical clients subscribing to our services include motion picture studios  television networks and stations  cable and telco operators  advertisers and advertising agencies 
he division the financial results from the he division continue to be affected by the changing dynamics in the home video rental market as well as overall economic trends and conditions 
this market is highly competitive and influenced greatly by consumer spending patterns and behaviors 
the end consumer has a wide variety of choices from which to select entertainment content and can easily shift from one provider to another 
some examples include renting product from our participating retailers or other retailers  purchasing previously viewed units from our participating retailers or other retailers  renting or purchasing product from kiosk locations  ordering product via online subscriptions and or online distributors mail delivery  subscribing to at home movie channels  downloading or streaming content via the internet  purchasing and owning the unit directly  or selecting an at home pay per view or on demand option from a satellite or cable provider 
our ppt system focuses primarily on the traditional brick and mortar retailer 
end consumers usage of other options for obtaining entertainment content  such as kiosks  continues to increase and our participating retailers market share has been negatively affected 
thus  for the foreseeable future  we expect revenue from our he division to continue to decline 
the landscape of the home video rental market for brick and mortar retailers has seen significant changes 
in the first half of calendar year  a major retailer  movie gallery  closed all of its  stores 
also  blockbuster entertainment blockbuster closed approximately  retail locations 
in april  blockbuster s assets were acquired by dish network corporation dish 
while dish continues to operate the remaining locations  in february it announced that it will close additional stores 
although movie gallery and blockbuster were not direct customers of ours  as a result of these closures  we believe the major brick and mortar retailers share of the overall industry is contracting 
it is difficult to predict what effect  if any  this will have on our program suppliers and or the performance of our participating retailers 
for the many regional chains and independent retailers who rent home entertainment products dvd  blu ray and video games units to consumers  it is more effective to acquire new release rental inventory on a lease basis instead of purchasing the inventory 
our ppt system provides participating retailers the opportunity to increase both the depth and breadth of their inventory  better satisfy consumer demand and more effectively compete in the marketplace 
also  many of our arrangements are structured so that the participating retailers pay reduced upfront fees and lower per transaction fees in exchange for ordering units of all titles offered by a particular program supplier referred to as output programs 
in general  we continue to be in good standing with our program suppliers  and we make ongoing efforts to strengthen those business relationships through enhancements to our current service offerings and the development of new service offerings 
we are also continually seeking to develop business relationships with new program suppliers 
our relationships with program suppliers typically may be terminated without cause upon thirty days written notice by either party 
sources of revenue revenue by segment includes the following ami division subscription fee and other revenue  primarily relating to custom reports  from box office essentials  ondemand essentials  and related ondemand everywhere products  and 
table of contents tv essentials  which includes stationview essentials 
he division transaction fees  which are generated when participating retailers rent units to consumers 
additionally  certain arrangements include guaranteed minimum revenue from our customers  which are recognized on the street release date  provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met  sell through fees  which are generated when participating retailers sell previously viewed rental units to consumers and or buy out fees generated when participating retailers purchase units at the end of the lease term  drs fees  which are generated from data tracking and reporting services provided to program suppliers  and other fees  which primarily include order processing fees  which are generated when units are ordered by  and distributed to  participating retailers

revenue revenue decreased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in revenue was primarily due to a decline in revenue from our he division  partially offset by an increase in ami revenue primarily related to growth in our existing lines of business 
these fluctuations are described in more detail below 
revenue increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in revenue was due to an increase in ami revenue related to our acquisition of nielsen edi limited and certain assets of the nielsen company united states  llc the edi business in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as well as growth in other ami lines of business  partially offset by declines in revenue from the he division as described in more detail below 
ami division revenue related to our entertainment essentials business information service offerings increased in both comparable periods

our acquisition of cin chiffres in the third quarter of fiscal contributed million to the increase 
subscription fees revenue also increased as a result of rate increases for existing accounts 
the increase in ondemand essentials revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to rate increases for existing clients  as well as the addition of new clients 
these factors were partially offset by a large non recurring custom project in fiscal the increase in ondemand essentials revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to a combination of adding new clients  providing custom reports and securing rate increases for existing clients 
the increase in tv essentials revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the addition of new clients  including local stations  networks and advertising agencies 
the increase in tv essentials revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the addition of clients who subscribe to our systems and other fees relating to periodic custom work

units with minimum guarantees also declined  resulting in a decrease in revenues of million  primarily due to the timing and number of major motion picture releases 
the decrease in rental transactions was due to fewer participating retailers  fewer available units and lower box office performance from theatrical titles in fiscal compared to fiscal  as well as continued changing market conditions 
also  warner brothers decided to release its video content in the retail channel before offering it to the rental market  which had a negative impact on the number of units available to us and represented of the decline in revenue 
we expect this decision to continue to negatively impact our ppt business for fiscal the decrease in transaction fees in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to fewer rental transactions at our participating retailers  which decreased by  partially offset by a increase in the rate per transaction  which excludes the impact of minimum guarantees 
minimum guarantees increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal due to the timing and number of major motion picture releases 
the decrease in rental transactions was due to fewer participating retailers  as well as continued changing market conditions 
the decrease in sell through fees in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to a decrease in sell through volume  as well as a decrease in the number of units purchased at end of term  both as a result of overall declines in units available for sale 
in addition  we experienced a decrease in the average rate per transaction in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to a shift in the mix of available units from our program suppliers 
the decrease in sell through fees in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in sell through volume and the overall rate per transaction 
the decrease in sell through volume was primarily due to an overall decline in units available for sale 
the number of transactions decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal  and the rate per transaction decreased 
the decrease in drs revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to fewer transactions  primarily as a result of a decline in transactions from blockbuster  offset by an increase in revenue of million as a result of our acquisition of media salvation during the fourth quarter of fiscal the increase in drs revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to higher volumes of transactions from online retailers and the addition of kiosk transactions in fiscal  partially offset by fewer transactions as a result of movie gallery s store closures 
the increase also reflects our acquisition of media salvation  which contributed million to the increase 
the decrease in other revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal and in fiscal compared to fiscal related primarily to reduced order processing fees as a result of the overall reduction in available units 
cost of sales and gross margins cost of sales represents the direct costs to produce revenue 
in the ami division  cost of sales includes costs associated with certain entertainment essentials business information offerings  and consists of costs associated with the operation of a call center for our box office essentials services  as well as costs associated with amortizing capitalized internally developed software used to provide the corresponding services and direct costs incurred to obtain  cleanse  process and integrate data as well as maintain our systems 
in the he division  cost of sales includes unit costs  transaction costs  sell through costs and freight costs 
sell through costs represent the amounts due to the program suppliers that hold the distribution rights to the units 
freight costs represent the cost 
table of contents to pick  pack and ship orders of units to the participating retailers 
our cost of sales can also be affected by the release dates of units with guarantees 
we recognize the guaranteed minimum costs on the release date 
the terms of some of our agreements result in cost of sales on titles in the first month in which the unit is released  which results in lower margins during the initial portion of the revenue sharing period 
once the unit s rental activity exceeds the required amount for these guaranteed minimums  margins generally expand during the second and third months of the unit s revenue sharing period 
however  since these factors are highly dependent upon the quality  timing and release dates of all new products  margins may not expand to any significant degree during any reporting period 
as a result  it is difficult to predict the impact these program supplier revenue sharing programs with guaranteed minimums will have on future results of operations in any reporting period

the increase in costs of sales within the ami division in fiscal compared to fiscal resulted primarily from increased costs related to our call center operations and obtaining  cleansing and processing data 
the increased costs in our call center operation were primarily due to the addition of the edi business  which operates call centers in numerous foreign locations 
the increase in costs related to obtaining  cleansing and processing data was primarily due to growth in our service offerings and revenue sharing arrangements in place with data providers

gross margins as a percentage of divisional revenues were as follows year ended march  ami division he division the decrease in gross margin in the ami division in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to increased costs associated with one of our data provider agreements  which converted to a fixed fee agreement in the third quarter of fiscal  and higher costs associated with amortization of our internally developed systems 
the increase in gross margin in the ami division in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the increase in revenue  partially offset by a million charge in the third quarter of fiscal related to an amendment to an agreement with one of our data providers 
this amendment allows us to provide more robust information reporting to our clients and furthers our efforts toward moving our products from data to knowledge based products and services that interpret this data 
additionally  the agreement was converted from a variable agreement based on revenue to a fixed fee arrangement 
the increase in gross margin in the he division in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to fewer total available and rented units including minimum guarantees 
as noted previously  guarantee units can result in cost of sales on the titles in the first month in which they are released 
the increase in gross margins in the he division in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the increase in drs revenue  which has higher margins 
selling and administrative selling and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits  development  marketing and advertising costs  legal and professional fees  communications costs  depreciation and amortization of tangible fixed assets and software  real and personal property leases  and other general corporate expenses

our long term strategic plan is heavily focused on the development  growth and expansion of our ami division  both domestically and internationally and we consider these expenses to be investments which will leverage this business 
the increase in selling and administrative expenses in the ami division in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a million increase related to costs associated with the edi business and a million charge in fiscal related to the increase in the value of a stock award granted to a non employee that is valued at the end of each reporting period  compared to a million charge in fiscal related to this award 
increased costs associated with expansion of our ami division and our acquisition of cin chiffres also contributed to the overall increase 
he division the decrease in selling and administrative expenses in the he division in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a reduction in overall headcount for the year 
the increase in selling and administrative expenses in the he division in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to our media salvation acquisition

income taxes our effective tax rate was an expense of in fiscal the rate was negatively affected by the recording of a million valuation allowance to fully reserve against our deferred tax assets 
primarily due to our investments in acquisitions  as well as expansion of our ami division and our equity compensation structure  we have accumulated operating losses over the past three fiscal years 
as a result  we evaluated various factors relating to these assets and determined that it was not more likely than not that all of our deferred tax assets would be realized 
in the future  if we generate taxable income  we expect to be able to utilize these deferred tax assets  which should reduce future tax expense 
our effective tax rate was a benefit of in fiscal the rate was positively impacted by federal and state research and experimentation credits of million  earnings on marketable securities that are exempt from federal income taxes of million and the tax impact of income in foreign locations of million  offset by increases in reserves on tax positions of million

inflation we believe that the impact of inflation was minimal on our business in fiscal  and liquidity and capital resources our sources of liquidity include our cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  cash expected to be generated from future operations and investments and our million line of credit 
based on our current financial projections and projected cash needs  we believe that our available sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our current operations  the continued current development of our business information services and other cash requirements through at least march  cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities increased million to million at march  from march  this increase resulted primarily from million provided by operating activities and million of proceeds received from a loan from the state of oregon 
these factors were offset by million used for the purchase of equipment and capitalization of internally developed software for our business information service offerings and million used for the repurchase of common stock 
portions of our cash and cash equivalents are held in our foreign subsidiaries 
we may not be able to repatriate these funds without significant tax implications 
as of march   we had million in foreign bank accounts  which we plan to use to fund our international expansion and growth 
we had million invested in a tax exempt bond fund as of march  bond fund values fluctuate in response to the financial condition of individual issues  general market and economic conditions and changes in interest rates 
in general  when interest rates rise  bond fund values fall and investors may lose principal value 
while we currently have no plans or requirements to sell the securities in the foreseeable future  we are exposed to market risks and cannot predict what impact fluctuations in the market may have on the value of these funds 
accounts and notes receivable  net of allowances  decreased million to million at march  from march   primarily due to lower revenues in the he division in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal during fiscal  we spent million on property and equipment  including million for the capitalization of internally developed software for our business information service offerings 
we anticipate spending a total of approximately million on property and equipment in fiscal  including approximately million for the capitalization of internally developed software  primarily for the development of systems for our entertainment essentials lines of business 
our total spending also includes amounts for computer equipment and renovations to our corporate offices 
as of march   we have been reimbursed 
table of contents million from the landlord for a portion of the costs associated with these renovations 
this amount is treated as a lease incentive  the value of which will reduce rent expense over the remaining lease term 
accounts payable decreased million to million at march  from march   primarily due to the timing of payments to our program suppliers 
accrued compensation increased million to million at march  from march   primarily due to million of severance related accruals associated with our international reorganization  increases in bonus accruals of million and a million increase in accrued stock based compensation that will be settled in cash and relates to an agreement with a non employee  which fluctuated with our stock price during fiscal deferred revenue increased million to million at march  from march  primarily due to increases in quarterly and annual subscriptions for our services 
deferred rent  current and long term  of million at march  represents amounts received for qualified renovations on our corporate headquarters and free rent during the lease term 
the deferred rent related to qualified renovations is being amortized against rent expense over the remaining lease term  which is expected to end december   at the rate of approximately  per quarter 
the deferred rent related to free rent will also be amortized against rent expense over the remaining lease term and is expected to be approximately  per quarter for fiscal in january  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of our common stock 
as of march    shares remained available for repurchase under this plan at a per share price not to exceed 
this plan does not have an expiration date 
in addition  in may  our board of directors authorized a one year share repurchase program for up to million of our outstanding common stock 
common stock repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices or through privately negotiated transactions 
the amount and timing of all repurchase transactions are contingent upon market conditions  regulatory requirements and alternative investment opportunities 
we did not repurchase any shares during the three months ended march  during all of fiscal  we repurchased  shares pursuant to this program at a weighted average price of per share for a total of million 
as of march   million remained available for repurchases pursuant to this program 
however  no additional shares were repurchased pursuant to this program before it expired in may we currently have a revolving line of credit for million that matures december  interest accrues on outstanding balances under the line of credit at a rate equal to libor plus percent 
the credit line is secured by substantially all of our assets and includes certain financial covenants 
in december   the agreement was amended to include a requirement that we maintain cash liquidity of three times the amount of all cumulative quarterly losses 
one of the financial covenants relates to reporting after tax income of not less than on an annual basis 
wells fargo bank na waived the income and cash liquidity requirements for the year ended march  on may   the credit line was amended to add a requirement that we maintain at least million in cash liquidity 
at march   we had no outstanding borrowings under this agreement and are in compliance with the remaining covenants 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we received a loan from the state of oregon for million for the purpose of facility renovations 
the loan bears interest at per annum and contains provisions relating to forgiveness if we meet certain requirements 
as of march   we are on schedule towards meeting those requirements 
the loan is due on january  if it is not forgiven

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the products or services have been delivered  for units released within our he division  we believe this condition is met when the film is complete and  in accordance with the terms of the arrangement  has been delivered or is available for immediate and unconditional delivery  the license period has begun which is referred to as the street date for a he product  the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the arrangement fee is reasonably assured based on our collection history 
within our he division  our agreements generally provide for an initial order processing fee and continuing transaction fees based on a percentage of rental revenue earned by the retailers upon renting the units to their customers 
initial order processing fees cover the direct costs of accessing units from program suppliers and handling  packaging and shipping of the units to the retailer 
once the units are shipped  we have no further obligation to provide services to the retailer 
we recognize order processing fees as revenue on the street date and recognize transaction fees when the units are rented to the consumers  provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
certain arrangements include guaranteed minimum revenue from our customers as well as our suppliers  which vary by studio and relate to single films  typically major motion picture releases 
these guarantees  which totaled million  million and million  respectively  in fiscal  and  are contractually fixed on the street date and are nonrefundable 
we follow accounting standards codification  which applies to the entertainment films industry  and requires that the entire amount of these minimum guarantees be recognized as revenue  along with the corresponding cost  on the street date  provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we entered into a long term agreement with a customer supplier relating to our entertainment essentials line of business  in which we developed reporting tools specifically relating to its unique business requirements 
we recognized revenue in accordance with the completed contract method and  accordingly  we recognized the revenue and related costs when the development project was completed during the second quarter of fiscal we recognize our business information services revenue ratably over the period of service 
revenue related to custom work projects is recognized upon delivery and acceptance by the customer 
accounts and notes receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
credit limits are established through a process of reviewing the financial history and stability of each customer 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable by monitoring past due balances 
if it is determined that a customer may be unable to meet its financial obligations  a specific reserve is established based on the amount we expect to recover 
an additional general reserve is provided based on aging of accounts receivable and our historical collection experience 
if circumstances change related to specific customers  overall aging of accounts receivable or collection experience  our estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable could materially change 
our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled million at both march  and see also 
schedule ii  valuation and qualifying accounts included in item of this annual report on form k 

table of contents deferred taxes deferred tax assets arise from the tax benefit of amounts expensed for financial reporting purposes but not yet deducted for tax purposes and from unutilized tax credits and net operating loss carry forwards 
we evaluate our deferred tax assets on a regular basis to determine if a valuation allowance is required 
to the extent it is determined the recoverability of the deferred tax assets is not more likely than not  we will record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
as of march  and  we had a valuation allowance of million and million  respectively  recorded against our federal net operating and capital loss carry forwards  as well as those net operating and capital loss carry forwards in various state and foreign jurisdictions 
net deferred tax liabilities totaled  as of march  and net deferred tax assets totaled million as of march  accounting for unrecognized tax benefits we record a benefit for uncertain tax positions only when we determine that those tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
as of march  and  the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was million and million  respectively  including penalties and interest of  and  respectively 
all unrecognized tax benefits at march  would affect the effective tax rate if recognized

capitalized software capitalized software  which is included in property and equipment  net  consists of costs to purchase and develop internal use software  as well as costs to develop internal software  which is used by us to provide various services to clients 
the internal and external costs to develop the internal software used to support these services are capitalized after the technological and business feasibility of the project is determined and the preliminary project stage is completed 
we continue to develop our internal software systems in order to expand our service offerings 
once we begin to utilize this software in our products  these costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated economic life of the software  which is five years from the date of utilization 
capitalized software is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
based on these reviews  we recorded impairment charges of  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
no impairment charges were recorded in fiscal changes in technology could affect our estimate of the useful life of those assets 
capitalized software costs  net of accumulated amortization  totaled million and million at march  and  respectively 
we also had million and million as of march  and  respectively  of capitalized costs associated with software projects which are still in the application development stage 
stock based compensation we are required to measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock based awards granted to our employees and directors  including employee stock options  deferred stock units dsus  stock appreciation rights sars  stock settled stock appreciation rights ssars and restricted stock units rsus  based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date 
we utilize the black scholes options pricing model and monte carlo simulations for valuing our stock based awards with a conversion or exercise price 
the use of the black scholes and monte carlo valuation models to estimate the fair value of stock option awards requires us to make judgments on assumptions regarding the risk free interest rate  expected dividend yield  expected term and expected volatility over the expected term of the award 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of expense could be materially different in the future 
compensation expense is only recognized on awards that ultimately vest and market based awards 
however  we have not reduced the stock based compensation expense for estimated forfeitures because there is no basis for estimating future forfeitures since most unvested awards are held by members of senior management 
we update for forfeitures as they occur and recognize any changes to accumulated compensation expense in the period of change 
if actual forfeitures are significant  our results of operations could be materially affected 
stock based compensation agreements with non employees we are required to recognize compensation expense for stock based compensation agreements with non employees based on the 
table of contents estimated fair value of the award on the grant date and at the end of each reporting period 
we utilize the black scholes valuation model to determine the end of period fair value of these awards and record the cumulative incremental change in value as compensation expense over the life of the award 
marketable securities we classify our marketable securities as available for sale securities and  accordingly  they are marked to market on a quarterly basis  with unrealized gains and losses being excluded from earnings and reflected as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
dividend and interest income is recognized when earned 
realized gains and losses are included in earnings and are derived using the specific identification method for determining the cost of securities sold 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and certain intangible assets acquired which have indefinite lives are not subject to amortization 
we test these assets for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they might be impaired  based on cash flows and other market valuation methods 
we amortize intangible assets with definite lives over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method and evaluate for impairment in accordance with our existing policy impairment of long lived assets  which is included in

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we operate globally and have exposure to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates 
in most markets  we generate revenue and expenses in local currencies 
foreign currency translation risk is the risk that exchange rate gains or losses arise from translating foreign entities statements of operations and balance sheets from functional currency to our reporting currency the united states dollar for consolidation purposes 
our most significant foreign currency risks relate to the euro  the argentine peso and the canadian dollar 
we have evaluated and assessed the potential effect of this risk and concluded that near term changes in currency rates should not materially adversely affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we performed a sensitivity analysis  assuming a decrease in the value of foreign currencies in which we operate 
our analysis has determined that a decrease in value would have resulted in a million decrease to our operating loss for the year ended march  we have exposure to interest rate risk related to our marketable securities and  to a lesser extent  our cash deposits
