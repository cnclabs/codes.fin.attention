table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash flow provided by operating activities was approximately million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to the improvement in the results of oil and natural gas operations

management continuously searches for opportunities to make cost effective acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties 
further  management evaluates the market price and trading volume of fieldpoint s common stock and may repurchase shares if capital is available and management believes that such repurchase would be advantageous to the company and its stockholders 
capital requirements management believes the company will be able to meet its current operating needs through internally generated cash from operations and borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility 
as of december   the company had working capital of approximately million and approximately million borrowing capacity under its line of credit based on a borrowing base of million 
the borrowing base is subject to redetermination based on the value of proved reserves  and could be increased or decreased during although the company had no significant commitments for capital expenditures at december   management anticipates continued investments in oil and natural gas properties during if bank credit is not available  fieldpoint may not be able to continue to invest in strategic oil and natural gas properties 
management cannot predict how oil and natural gas prices will fluctuate during and what effect they will ultimately have on the company  but management believes that the company will be able to generate sufficient cash from operations to service its bank debt and provide for maintaining current production of its oil and natural gas properties 
the timing of most capital expenditures is relatively discretionary 
therefore  the company can plan expenditures to coincide with available funds in order to minimize business risks 
as of december   the company had approximately million of capital items in accounts payable that will be paid from working capital 
subsequent events the company s board of directors has declared a dividend to common stockholders of record on march  the record date consisting of one common stock purchase warrant the warrant dividend and warrant  respectively for every share of common stock owned on the record date

no prediction can be made if the warrants will provide any significant additional working capital in the future
