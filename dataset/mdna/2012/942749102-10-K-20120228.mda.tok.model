item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a leading supplier of products for use in the water quality  water safety  water flow control and water conservation markets in both north america and europe with a presence in asia 
for over years  we have designed and manufactured products that promote the comfort and safety of people and the quality and conservation of water used in commercial and residential applications 
we earn revenue and income almost exclusively from the sale of our products 
our principal product lines include residential commercial flow control products includes products typically sold into plumbing and hot water applications such as backflow preventers  water pressure regulators  temperature and pressure relief valves  and thermostatic mixing valves 
hvac gas products includes hydronic and electric heating systems for under floor radiant applications  hydronic pump groups for boiler manufacturers and alternative energy control packages  and flexible stainless steel connectors for natural and liquid propane gas in commercial food service and residential applications 
hvac is an acronym for heating  ventilation and air conditioning 
drains water re use products includes drainage products and engineered rain water harvesting solutions for commercial  industrial  marine and residential applications 
water quality products includes point of use and point of entry water filtration  conditioning and scale prevention systems for both commercial and residential applications 
our business is reported in three geographic segments north america  europe and asia 
we distribute our products through three primary distribution channels wholesale  do it yourself diy and original equipment manufacturers oems 
we believe that the factors relating to our future growth include our ability to continue to make selective acquisitions  both in our core markets as well as in new complementary markets  regulatory requirements relating to the quality and conservation of water  safe use of water  increased demand for clean water  continued enforcement of plumbing and building codes and a healthy economic environment 
we have completed acquisitions since divesting our industrial and oil and gas business in our acquisition strategy focuses on businesses that manufacture preferred brand name products that address our themes of water quality  water conservation  water safety and water flow control and related complementary markets 
we target businesses that will provide us with one or more of the following an entry into new markets  an increase in shelf space with existing customers  a new or improved technology or an expansion of the breadth of our water quality  water conservation  water safety and water flow control products for the commercial  industrial and residential markets 
products representing a majority of our sales are subject to regulatory standards and code enforcement  which typically require that these products meet stringent performance criteria 
together with our commissioned manufacturers representatives  we have consistently advocated for the development and enforcement of such plumbing codes 
we are focused on maintaining stringent quality control and testing procedures at each of our manufacturing facilities in order to manufacture products in compliance with code requirements and take advantage of the resulting demand for compliant products 
we believe that the product development  product testing capability and investment in plant and equipment needed to manufacture products in compliance with code requirements  represent a competitive advantage for us 
in  we experienced many of the same macro challenges that affected our business in the previous year 
the commercial marketplace continued to struggle  we saw low residential activity and commodity prices remained volatile 
despite the challenging end markets  we were able to grow sales organically by and grow income from continuing operations by 
organic sales growth excludes the impacts of acquisitions  divestitures and foreign exchange from year over year comparisons 
we believe this provides investors with a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis 
we continued our restructuring programs to right size our manufacturing footprint and we sustained our continuous improvement initiatives to gain productivity in our operations 
our performance improved as progressed 
during the first half of  increases in the cost of copper reduced margins for our high copper content products and we encountered operational inefficiencies as a result of our french restructuring efforts 
copper costs increased during the later portion of and into early  reaching an all time high in april we were able to balance commodity costs through price increases by mid year  providing better results during the second half of in general  we were more successful in north america than in europe in passing on price increases to our end customers during the year 
europe has and continues to experience uncertainties regarding its economy  driven largely by sovereign debt concerns 
we believe the economic uncertainty is affecting how our competitors are pricing in end markets 
we believe that price increases may continue to be difficult to achieve in many of our european markets in copper costs abated somewhat during the second half of  but have begun to trend upward again through early february we have announced selected price increases for in certain markets but we cannot determine whether such initiatives will be successful in the marketplace 
we continually review our business and implement restructuring plans as needed

non gaap financial measures we believe free cash flow to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating performance because it provides investors with a measure of our ability to generate cash  to repay debt and to fund acquisitions 
other companies may define free cash flow differently 
free cash flow does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap 
therefore it should not be considered an alternative to net cash provided by operations as an indication of our performance 
free cash flow should also not be considered an alternative to net cash provided by operations as defined by gaap 
the cash conversion rate of free cash flow to net income from continuing operations is also a measure of our performance in cash flow generation 
a reconciliation of net cash provided by continuing operations to free cash flow and calculation of our cash conversion rate is provided below years ended december  in millions net cash provided by continuing operations less additions to property  plant  and equipment plus proceeds from the sale of property  plant  and equipment free cash flow net income from continuing operations as reported cash conversion rate of free cash flow to net income from continuing operations our net debt to capitalization ratio  a non gaap financial measure used by management  increased to for from for the increase resulted from cash used for and debt incurred  as part of the socla acquisition 
management believes it to be an appropriate supplemental measure because it helps investors understand our ability to meet our financing needs and as a basis to evaluate our financial structure 
our computation may not be comparable to other companies that may define net debt to capitalization differently 
a reconciliation of long term debt including current portion to net debt and our net debt to capitalization ratio is provided below december  in millions current portion of long term debt plus long term debt  net of current portion less cash and cash equivalents net debt a reconciliation of capitalization is provided below december  in millions net debt total stockholders equity capitalization net debt to capitalization ratio contractual obligations our contractual obligations as of december  are presented in the following table payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in millions long term debt obligations  including current maturities a operating lease obligations capital lease obligations a pension contributions interest b earnout payments a other c total a as recognized in the consolidated balance sheet b assumes the balance on the revolving credit facility remains at million and the interest rate remains at approximately for the presented periods c includes commodity and capital commitments  acquisition of tekmar  ceo separation costs and other benefits at december  we maintain letters of credit that guarantee our performance or payment to third parties in accordance with specified terms and conditions 
amounts outstanding were approximately million as of december  and our letters of credit are primarily associated with insurance coverage and  to a lesser extent  foreign purchases and generally expire within one year of issuance 
these instruments may exist or expire without being drawn down  therefore they do not necessarily represent future cash flow obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements except for operating lease commitments  we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
application of critical accounting policies and key estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported 
a critical accounting estimate is an assumption about highly uncertain matters and could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements if another  also reasonable  amount were used  or  a change in the estimate is reasonably likely from period to period 
we base our assumptions on historical experience and on other estimates that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
there were no changes in our accounting policies or significant changes in our accounting estimates during except for a change in the amortization period of pension gains and losses as discussed below under the caption pension benefits 
we periodically discuss the development  selection and disclosure of the estimates with our audit committee 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met we have entered into a binding agreement  the product has shipped and title has passed  the sales price to the customer is fixed or is determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue based upon a determination that all criteria for revenue recognition have been met  which  based on the majority of our shipping terms  is considered to have occurred upon shipment of the finished product 
some shipping terms require the goods to be received by the customer before title passes 
in those instances  revenues are not recognized until the customer has received the goods 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer returns and allowances and for customer programs 
provisions for returns and allowances are made at the time of sale  derived from historical trends and form a portion of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
customer programs  which are primarily annual volume incentive plans  allow customers to earn credit for attaining agreed upon purchase targets from us 
we record estimated reductions to revenue  made at the time of sale  for customer programs based on estimated purchase targets 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is established to represent our best estimate of the net realizable value of the outstanding accounts receivable 
the development of our allowance for doubtful accounts varies by region but in general is based on a review of past due amounts  historical write off experience  as well as aging trends affecting specific accounts and general operational factors affecting all accounts 
in addition  factors are developed in certain regions utilizing historical trends of sales and returns and allowances and cash discount activities to derive a reserve for returns and allowances and cash discounts 
we uniformly consider current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we also aggressively monitor the creditworthiness of our largest customers  and periodically review customer credit limits to reduce risk 
if circumstances relating to specific customers change or unanticipated changes occur in the general business environment  our estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with costs determined primarily on a first in first out basis 
we utilize both specific product identification and historical product demand as the basis for determining our excess or obsolete inventory reserve 
we identify all inventories that exceed a range of one to four years in sales 
this is determined by comparing the current inventory balance against unit sales for the trailing twelve months 
new products added to inventory within the past twelve months are excluded from this analysis 
a portion of our products contain recoverable materials  therefore the excess and obsolete reserve is established net of any recoverable amounts 
changes in market conditions  lower than expected customer demand or changes in technology or features could result in additional obsolete inventory that is not saleable and could require additional inventory reserve provisions 
in certain countries  additional inventory reserves are maintained for potential shrinkage experienced in the manufacturing process 
the reserve is established based on the prior year s inventory losses adjusted for any change in the gross inventory balance 
goodwill and other intangibles we have made numerous acquisitions over the years which included the recognition of a significant amount of goodwill 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss may have been incurred 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using an income approach based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
we believe this approach yields the most appropriate evidence of fair value as our reporting units are not easily compared to other corporations involved in similar businesses 
intangible assets such as purchased technology are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition 
values assigned to intangible assets are determined by an independent valuation firm based on our estimates and judgments regarding expectations of the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired 
during  and  we recognized non cash pre tax charges of approximately million  million and million  respectively  as an impairment of some of our indefinite lived intangible assets 
in addition  during  we recognized non cash pretax charges of million as an impairment of certain amortizable intangible assets in our europe segment 
in  the company determined that the prospects for austroflex rohr isoliersysteme gmbh austroflex  part of our europe segment  were lower than originally estimated due to current operating profits below forecast and tempered future growth expectations 
accordingly  the company performed a fair value assessment and  as a result  wrote down the long lived assets by million  or approximately  including customer relationships of million  trade names of million  and property  plant and equipment of million 
fair value was based on discounted cash flows using market participant assumptions and utilized an estimated weighted average cost of capital 
revised accounting guidance issued in september allows us to review goodwill for impairment utilizing either qualitative or quantitative analyses 
we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the totality of events and circumstances  we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  then performing the two step quantitative impairment test is unnecessary 
we first identify those reporting units that we believe could pass a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary 
for each reporting unit identified  our qualitative analysis includes a review of the most recent fair value calculation to identify the extent of the cushion between fair value and carrying amount  to determine if a substantial cushion existed 
a review of events and circumstances that have occurred since the most recent fair value calculation to determine if those events or circumstances would have affected our previous fair value assessment 
items identified and reviewed include macroeconomic conditions  industry and market changes  cost factor changes  events that affect the reporting unit  financial performance against expectations and the reporting unit s performance relative to peers 
we then compile this information and make our assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if we determine it is not more likely than not  then no further quantitative analysis is required 
we determined we have eight reporting units in continuing operations  one of which  water quality  has no goodwill 
in  we performed a qualitative analysis for the residential and commercial formerly regulator  dormont and asia reporting units and concluded further impairment testing was not required 
the second analysis for goodwill impairment involves a quantitative two step process 
we performed a quantitative impairment analysis for our drains and water re use formerly orion  brae  europe and bl cher reporting units 
the first step of the impairment test requires a comparison of the fair value of each of our reporting units to the respective carrying value 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit is less than its fair value  no indication of impairment exists and a second step is not performed 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit is higher than its fair value  there is an indication that impairment may exist and a second step must be performed 
in the second step  the impairment is computed by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill  an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess and charged to operations 
inherent in our development of the present value of future cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results  business plans  expected growth rates  cost of capital and tax rates 
we also make certain assumptions about future economic conditions and other market data 
we develop our assumptions based on our historical results including sales growth  operating profits  working capital levels and tax rates 
we believe that the discounted cash flow model is sensitive to the selected discount rate 
we use third party valuation specialists to help develop appropriate discount rates for each reporting unit 
we use standard valuation practices to arrive at a weighted average cost of capital based on the market and guideline public companies 
the higher the discount rate  the lower the discounted cash flows 
while we believe that our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions could significantly affect our valuations and result in impairments in the future 
during the fourth quarter of  we recognized apre tax non cash goodwill impairment charge of million related to our brae reporting unit within our north america segment 
as of our october  testing date  we had approximately million of goodwill on our balance sheet 
our impairment testing indicated that the fair values of the reporting units  except for brae  exceeded the carrying values  thereby resulting in no impairment 
the results of this impairment analysis are summarized in the table below goodwill balance at october  book value of equity of reporting unit at october  estimated fair value implied value of equity at october  in millions reporting unit europe bl cher drains water re use brae the underlying analyses supporting our fair value assessment related to our outlook of the business long term performance  which included key assumptions as to the appropriate discount rate and long term growth rate 
in connection with our october  impairment test  we utilized discount rates ranging from to  growth rates beyond our planning periods ranging from to and long term terminal growth rates from to 
operating results for our europe segment have been hindered by the downturn in the economic environment in europe 
should europe s sales decline because the european marketplace deteriorates beyond our current expectations  then the reporting unit s goodwill may be at risk for impairment in the future 
europe s goodwill balance as of december  was million

product liability and workers compensation costs because of retention requirements associated with our insurance policies  we are generally self insured for potential product liability claims and for workers compensation costs associated with workplace accidents 
we are subject to a variety of potential liabilities in connection with product liability cases and we maintain product liability and other insurance coverage  which we believe to be generally in accordance with industry practices 
for product liability cases in the us  management establishes its product liability accrual by utilizing third party actuarial valuations which incorporates historical trend factors and our specific claims experience derived from loss reports provided by third party administrators 
in other countries  we maintain insurance coverage with relatively high deductible payments  as product liability claims tend to be smaller than those experienced in the us changes in the nature of claims or the actual settlement amounts could affect the adequacy of this estimate and require changes to the provisions 
because the liability is an estimate  the ultimate liability may be more or less than reported 
workers compensation liabilities in the us are recognized for claims incurred including claims incurred but not reported and for changes in the status of individual case reserves 
at the time a workers compensation claim is filed  a liability is estimated to settle the claim 
the liability for workers compensation claims is determined based on management s estimates of the nature and severity of the claims and based on analysis provided by third party administrators and by various state statutes and reserve requirements 
we have developed our own trend factors based on our specific claims experience  discounted based on risk free interest rates 
we employ third party actuarial valuations to help us estimate our workers compensation accrual 
in other countries where workers compensation costs are applicable  we maintain insurance coverage with limited deductible payments 
because the liability is an estimate  the ultimate liability may be more or less than reported and is subject to changes in discount rates 
we determine the trend factors for product liability and workers compensation liabilities based on consultation with outside actuaries 
we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers to minimize our risks related to catastrophic claims in excess of all self insured positions 
any material change in the aforementioned factors could have an adverse impact on our operating results 
legal contingencies we are a defendant in numerous legal matters including those involving environmental law and product liability as discussed in more detail in part i  item business product liability  environmental and other litigation matters 
as required by gaap  we determine whether an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and the loss amount can be reasonably estimated  net of any applicable insurance proceeds 
when it is possible to estimate reasonably possible loss or range of loss above the amount accrued  that estimate is aggregated and disclosed 
estimates of potential outcomes of these contingencies are developed in consultation with outside counsel 
while this assessment is based upon all available information  litigation is inherently uncertain and the actual liability to fully resolve litigation cannot be predicted with any assurance of accuracy 
in the event of an unfavorable outcome in one or more legal matters  the ultimate liability may be in excess of amounts currently accrued  if any  and may be material to our operating results or cash flows for a particular quarterly or annual period 
however  based on information currently known to us  management believes that the ultimate outcome of all legal contingencies  as they are resolved over time  is not likely to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations  cash flows or liquidity 
pension benefits we account for our pension plans in accordance with gaap  which involves recording a liability or asset based on the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets 
assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets 
the primary assumptions are as follows weighted average discount rate this rate is used to estimate the current value of future benefits 
this rate is adjusted based on movement in long term interest rates 
expected long term rate of return on assets this rate is used to estimate future growth in investments and investment earnings 
the expected return is based upon a combination of historical market performance and anticipated future returns for a portfolio reflecting the mix of equity  debt and other investments indicative of our plan assets 
rates of increase in compensation levels this rate is used to estimate projected annual pay increases  which are used to determine the wage base used to project employees pension benefits at retirement 
we determine these assumptions based on consultation with outside actuaries and investment advisors 
any variance in these assumptions could have a significant impact on future recognized pension costs  assets and liabilities 
on october   our board of directors voted to cease accruals effective december  under both the pension plan and supplemental employees retirement plan 
we recorded a curtailment charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of in connection with this action 
effective november   we began amortizing the unamortized gains and losses over the remaining life expectancy of the participants instead of our former policy of average remaining service period 
income taxes we estimate and use our expected annual effective income tax rates to accrue income taxes 
effective tax rates are determined based on budgeted earnings before taxes  including our best estimate of permanent items that will affect the effective rate for the year 
management periodically reviews these rates with outside tax advisors and changes are made if material variances from expectations are identified 
we recognize deferred taxes for the expected future consequences of events that have been reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the book values and tax bases of particular assets and liabilities  using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets if  based upon the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we consider estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce exposure to adverse fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  interest rates and costs of certain raw materials used in the manufacturing process 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
as a matter of policy  all derivative positions are used to reduce risk by hedging underlying economic exposure 
the derivatives we use are instruments with liquid markets 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  our consolidated earnings  which are reported in united states dollars  are subject to translation risks due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
this risk is concentrated in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro  the us dollar and the canadian dollar  and the us dollar and the chinese yuan 
our foreign subsidiaries transact most business  including certain intercompany transactions  in foreign currencies 
such transactions are principally purchases or sales of materials and are denominated in european currencies or the us or canadian dollar 
we use foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage the risk related to intercompany purchases that occur during the course of a year and certain open foreign currency denominated commitments to sell products to third parties 
for  we recorded a million gain in other income associated with the change in the fair value of such contracts 
we have historically had a low exposure on the cost of our debt to changes in interest rates 
information about our long term debt including principal amounts and related interest rates appears in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  we purchase significant amounts of bronze ingot  brass rod  cast iron  steel and plastic  which are utilized in manufacturing our many product lines 
our operating results can be adversely affected by changes in commodity prices if we are unable to pass on related price increases to our customers 
we manage this risk by monitoring related market prices  working with our suppliers to achieve the maximum level of stability in their costs and related pricing  seeking alternative supply sources when necessary and passing increases in commodity costs to our customers  to the maximum extent possible  when they occur
