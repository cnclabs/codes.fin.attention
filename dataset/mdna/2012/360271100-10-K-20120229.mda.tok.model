overview summary financial results the corporation generates the majority of its revenue through net interest income  or the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
growth in net interest income is dependent upon balance sheet growth and or maintaining or increasing the net interest margin  which is net interest income fully taxable equivalent as a percentage of average interest earning assets 
the corporation also generates revenue through fees earned on the various services and products offered to its customers and through gains on sales of assets  such as loans  investments  or properties 
offsetting these revenue sources are provisions for credit losses on loans  operating expenses and income taxes

was characterized by improving  but still challenging  general economic conditions  a continuation of the low interest rate environment  and increasing regulatory and compliance changes 
these factors  along with the corporation s efforts to control discretionary spending in light of both current and future challenges  resulted in positive earnings growth and an improved capital position 
the following is a summary of the significant factors impacting the corporation s financial performance in improved asset quality the corporation s provision for credit losses decreased million  or  to million in from million in due to improved credit quality metrics and reduced allocation needs 
general market conditions stabilized in the corporation s pennsylvania  maryland  northern delaware and virginia markets  but remained more challenging in its new jersey market 
despite improving economic conditions  many of the corporation s borrowers remain stressed  impacting both the pace of asset quality improvement and the growth in loans 
non performing assets decreased million  or  in compared to due to the continued resolution of distressed assets  including the sale of million of non performing residential mortgages and home equity loans in december to a third party investor 
non performing assets at december  were at their lowest level since march  and delinquencies were at their lowest level since march  while net charge offs increased  additional provisions for credit losses were not needed as allowance allocations were considered to be sufficient 
growth in net interest income and an improved net interest margin net interest income increased million  to million in from million in the net interest margin increased basis points  to in as compared to in the increases in both net interest income and net interest margin were primarily attributable to decreases in funding costs as interest rates remained at historically low levels throughout the year 
partially offsetting the decrease in funding costs was a decline in yields on interest earning assets of basis points  or  and a million  or  decrease in average interest earning assets 
while the net interest margin improved  growing earning assets remained a challenge 
as a result  the positive impact to net interest income resulting from the increase in the margin was largely offset by the effect of the decrease in average interest earning assets 
other income growth  despite regulatory headwinds total other income  excluding gains on sales of investment securities  increased million  or 
during  the corporation was able to achieve moderate growth in total other income in spite of regulatory changes which had a negative effect on certain fee categories  primarily overdraft fees and interchange income on debit card transactions 
improvements in other fee categories that were driven by changes in fee structures and increased transaction volumes mitigated the impact of these changes 
total other income was also affected by a million  or  decrease in mortgage banking income resulting from a million increase to mortgage banking income in for a correction in the methodology for determining the fair value of commitments to originate fixed rate mortgages held for sale 
moderate other expense increase other expenses increased million  or 
the corporation continued to experience upward pressure on its expenses as a result of continuing loan workout efforts and expanding regulatory and compliance requirements 
such increases were mitigated to a degree through continued control of discretionary expenses  such as marketing expense  which decreased million  or  in the efficiency ratio remained strong at in  although this also represented a moderate increase from the most significant variances were seen in salaries and employee benefits million  or  increase and fdic insurance expense million  or  decrease 
as a result of the increase in earnings outpacing the growth in the balance sheet  the corporation s capital position improved in total shareholders equity increased million  or  to billion at december  regulatory capital also grew  as shown by an increase in the total risk based capital ratio to at december   as compared to in the prior year 
with the improvements in both capital levels and earnings  the corporation was able to increase its shareholder dividends during the total dividend per share was in as compared to in in  the corporation will continue to focus on increasing market share  prudently deploying capital  reducing credit costs and providing superior customer service 
in an effort to improve both its operating efficiency and customer service  the corporation will be converting and upgrading its core banking systems over the next two years 
while there will be moderate cost increases associated with the implementation of these new systems  the corporation will benefit from the ability to expand product offerings  enhance delivery channels and improve customer service

the million  or  increase in residential mortgages was largely due to the corporation s retention in portfolio of certain and year fixed rate mortgages and certain adjustable rate mortgages to partially mitigate the impact of decreases in average interest earning assets 
see further discussion regarding the impact of retaining these mortgages under the heading other income and expenses  below 
the million  or  decrease in construction loans was a result of charge offs and repayments exceeding originations  in addition to the conversion of commercial construction loans to permanent mortgages

as noted above  the decrease in short term customer certificates of deposit was largely due to customers migrating funds to interest bearing savings and demand accounts 
the growth in longer term certificates of deposit was due to the corporation s continuing focus on building customer relationships  while at the same time extending funding maturities at reasonable rates over a longer time horizon 
the decrease in brokered certificates of deposit occurred because the significant growth in customer funding reduced the need for non core funding alternatives 
the average cost of interest bearing deposits decreased basis points  or  from in to in  primarily due to the maturities of higher rate certificates of deposit

fhlb advances decreased million  or  due to maturities  which were generally not replaced with new advances 
provision and allowance for credit losses the corporation accounts for the credit risk associated with lending activities through its allowance for credit losses and provision for credit losses 
the provision is the expense recognized on the consolidated statements of income to adjust the allowance to its proper balance  as determined through the application of the corporation s allowance methodology procedures 
these procedures include the evaluation of the risk characteristics of the portfolio and documentation in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 selected loan loss allowance methodology and documentation issues 
the corporation s established methodology for evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses considers both components of the allowance specific allowances allocated to loans evaluated for impairment under the financial accounting standards board s accounting standards codification fasb asc section  and allowances calculated for pools of loans evaluated for impairment under fasb asc subtopic effective april   the corporation revised and enhanced its allowance for credit loss methodology 
this change in methodology did not impact the total allowance for credit losses 
see the critical accounting policies section of management s discussion for a discussion of the corporation s allowance for credit loss evaluation methodology 
the development of the corporation s allowance for credit losses is based first on a segmentation of its loan portfolio by general loan type  or portfolio segments 
certain portfolio segments are further disaggregated and evaluated for impairment based on class segments  which are largely based on the type of collateral underlying each loan 
for commercial loans  class segments include loans secured by collateral and unsecured loans 
construction loan class segments include loans secured by commercial real estate and loans secured by residential real estate 
consumer loan class segments are based on collateral types and include direct consumer installment loans and indirect automobile loans

the corporation s provision for credit losses for totaled million  a million  or  decrease from the million provision for credit losses in  as the level of non performing assets decreased  leading to a decrease in additional allocation needs 
while the provision for credit losses decreased  net charge offs increased as losses previously provided for were realized 
this relationship between the provision for credit losses and net charge offs is not unusual  since the recognition of losses through the provision generally occurs before such losses are realized through a charge off against the allowance for credit losses 
net charge offs increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase in net charge offs was primarily due to increases in residential mortgage net charge offs million  or and commercial loan net charge offs million  or  partially offset by declines in construction loan net charge offs million  or  commercial mortgage net charge offs million  or and consumer and other net charge offs million  or

provision for loan losses is net of a  decrease in provision applied to unfunded commitments for the year ended december  the total provision for credit losses  comprised of allocations for both funded and unfunded loans  was million for the year ended december  during  the million provision for loan losses  including the impact of the corporation s change in methodology  was allocated to commercial mortgages  to residential mortgages  to commercial mortgages  to home equity loans and to construction loans 
allocations of the provision for loan losses to these loan types were offset by a negative provision to reduce the unallocated allowance by million  due to the corporation s new reserve methodology  including an enhanced qualitative process that has further quantified inherent risks that were historically covered by the unallocated allowance 
changes in allocations by portfolio segment are driven by indications of credit quality deterioration

the million  or  increase in equipment expense was largely due to a  or  increase in depreciation expense  primarily related to the addition of assets supporting the corporation s information technology infrastructure  and increased maintenance costs 
the  or  increase in professional fees was due to increased legal costs associated with the collection and workout efforts for non performing loans  in addition to an increase in regulatory fees 
the million  or  decrease in marketing expenses was due to efforts to control expenditures and the timing of promotional campaigns in the  or  increase in oreo and repossession expense was due to increased costs associated with the repossession of foreclosed assets  partially offset by a net increase in gains on sales of oreo 
total net gains on sales of oreo were  in compared to net losses of  in oreo and repossession expense is expected to be volatile as the corporation continues to work through repossessed real estate 
the  or  decrease in intangible amortization was due to certain core deposit intangible assets becoming fully amortized during the million  or  decrease in operating risk loss was primarily due to a million reduction in accruals for potential repurchases of previously sold residential mortgage and home equity loans 
the million  or  increase in other expenses included a million increase in software maintenance costs 
in mid  the corporation entered into a three year desktop software licensing agreement  thereby resulting in a full year of costs for this maintenance agreement in compared to a partial year impact in also contributing to the increase in other expenses was a  increase in merchant and debit cardholder assessment fees  a  increase in losses on the sale of fixed assets   of consulting services related to the corporation s planned core technology platform upgrade and a  loss upon redemption of a junior subordinated deferrable interest debenture in vs 
other income other income for increased million  or  in comparison to excluding investment securities gains and losses  other income increased million  or 
service charges on deposit accounts decreased million  or  due primarily to a million  or  decrease in cash management fees and a  or  decrease in overdraft fees 
the decrease in cash management fees was a result of customers transferring funds from the cash management program to deposits due to the low interest rate environment 
average cash management balances decreased in in comparison to the  or  decrease in overdraft fees was a result of regulations which took effect in august of that require customers to affirmatively consent to the payment of certain types of overdrafts 
partially offsetting the effect of these regulations was growth in fees largely due to an increase in transaction volumes 
other service charges and fees increased million  or  including a million  or  increase in debit card income  which was partially due to an increase in transaction volumes and partially due to the introduction of a new rewards points program in also contributing to the increase in other service charges and fees was a million  or  increase in merchant fees and a million  or  increase in foreign currency processing income  both due to increases in transaction volumes 
the corporation s fulton bank  na subsidiary has a foreign currency payment processing division that achieved significant growth over the past two years  contributing to the increase in foreign currency processing income 
these increases in other service charges and fees were partially offset by a million  or  decrease in letter of credit fees  which was due to a decrease in the balance of letters of credit outstanding from million at december  to million at december  investment management and trust services increased million  or  due primarily to a million  or  increase in brokerage revenue  partially offset by a  or  decrease in trust commissions 
throughout  the corporation expanded its brokerage operations by adding to its sales staff and transitioning from a transaction based revenue model to a relationship based model  which generates fees based on the values of assets under management rather than transaction volume 
in  the effect of these fully implemented changes resulted in a positive impact to brokerage revenue 
mortgage banking income increased million  or  which included a million increase in gains on sales of mortgage loans  offset by a  decrease in mortgage servicing income 
during  the corporation recorded a million increase to mortgage banking income resulting from a correction of its methodology for determining the fair value of its interest rate locks 
adjusting for the impact of this change  mortgage banking income increased million  or  due to an increase in the spread on loans sold in  partially offset by lower volumes 
total loans sold in were billion  compared to billion of loans sold in the million  or  decrease in loans sold was due to a decrease in refinance volumes 
refinances accounted for of sale volumes in  compared to in the decrease in mortgage servicing income was due to a  increase to the mortgage servicing rights valuation allowance as expected prepayment speeds increased during the year 
credit card income increased  or  primarily due to an increase of transactions on credit cards previously originated and new card account originations  which generate fees under a joint marketing agreement with an independent third party 
other income decreased  or  primarily due to a decrease in title search fee income  as a result of lower volumes of residential mortgage loans originated 
investment securities gains of  for included million of net gains on the sales of securities  partially offset by other than temporary impairment charges of million 
during  the corporation recorded other than temporary impairment charges of million of for pooled trust preferred securities issued by financial institutions and million for financial institutions stocks 
the million of investment securities gains for resulted from million of net gains on sales of debt securities  partially offset by million of other than temporary impairment charges for pooled trust preferred securities issued by financial institutions and million of other than temporary impairment charges for financial institutions stocks 
other expenses other expenses decreased million  or  in comparison to salaries and employee benefits decreased million  or  with salaries increasing  or  and employee benefits decreasing million  or 
the moderate increase in salaries expense was due to the ending of a month freeze on merit increases in march  which was largely offset by a decrease in average full time equivalent employees  from approximately  in to approximately  in  and an  decrease in incentive compensation expenses 
the decrease in employee benefits was primarily due to a million decrease in healthcare claims costs due in part to a change in employee deductibles  a  decrease in defined benefit pension plan expense due to a higher return on plan assets and a decrease in severance expense  primarily due to  of severance expense recorded in related to the consolidation of the corporation s columbia bank subsidiary s back office functions 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in accruals for compensated absences 
net occupancy expense increased million  or  due to higher maintenance expense  primarily snow removal and utilities costs 
fdic insurance expense decreased million  or  due to the impact of the million special assessment recorded in and the corporation opting out of the transaction account guarantee program in mid year the impact of these decreases was partially offset by an increase in fdic assessment rates 
data processing expense decreased million  or  primarily due to savings realized from the consolidation of back office functions of the corporation s columbia bank subsidiary during equipment expense decreased million  or  largely due to a decrease in depreciation expense and an increase in certain vendor rebates in professional fees increased million  or  due to increased legal costs associated with the collection and workout efforts for non performing loans  in addition to an increase in regulatory fees 
marketing expenses increased million  or  due to new promotional campaigns initiated in oreo and repossession expense increased  or  due primarily to increased costs associated with the repossession of foreclosed assets and a net increase in provisions and net losses on sales of oreo 
operating risk loss decreased million  or  due a million charge recorded in related to the corporation s commitment to purchase illiquid auction rate securities from customer accounts 
the corporation did not record any charges related to this guarantee in as all remaining customer auction rate securities were purchased during partially offsetting this increase was the effect of  of credits  recorded in  related to a reduction in the corporation s accrual for potential repurchases of previously sold residential mortgage and home equity loans 
other expenses increased million  or  which included a million increase in software maintenance costs  mainly due to upgrades in desktop software for virtually all employees  an  increase in student loan lender expense as a result of the low interest rate environment and a  increase in provision for debit card rewards points earned 
income taxes income tax expense for was million  an increase of million  or  from income tax expense for increased million  or  from the corporation s effective tax rate income taxes divided by income before income taxes was  and in  and  respectively

the corporation classified of its investment portfolio as available for sale as of december  and  as such  these investments were recorded at their estimated fair values 
the net unrealized gain on available for sale investment securities was million as of december   compared to million as of december  during  improvements in the fair values of state and municipal securities  mortgage backed securities and corporate debt securities were partially offset by decreases in the fair values of auction rate securities and equity securities 
loans the following table presents loans outstanding  by type  as of the dates shown december in thousands real estate commercial mortgage commercial industrial  financial and agricultural real estate home equity real estate residential mortgage real estate construction consumer leasing and other gross loans unearned income loans  net of unearned income total loans  net of unearned income  increased million  or  due to slightly improved demand  particularly within the commercial mortgage portfolio  which increased million  or 
also contributing to the increase in loans was a million  or  increase in residential mortgages  which was a result of the corporation s retention in portfolio of certain and year fixed rate mortgages and certain adjustable rate mortgages rather than being sold in the secondary market 
these increases were offset by a million  or  decrease in construction loans  due to a combination of weak demand for new residential housing and continuing efforts by the corporation to reduce its exposure within this sector  specifically in its maryland  new jersey and virginia markets 
commercial loans also decreased million  or  mostly due to a by product of slow economic growth 
consumer loans decreased million  or  due to a million decrease in direct consumer loans and a million decrease in the indirect automobile loan portfolio 
approximately billion  or  of the corporation s loan portfolio was in commercial mortgage and construction loans as of december  the corporation does not have a concentration of credit risk with any single borrower  industry or geographical location 
however  the performance of real estate markets and general economic conditions adversely impacted the performance of these loans throughout other assets cash and due from banks increased million  or 
because of the daily fluctuations that result in the normal course of business  cash is more appropriately analyzed in terms of average balances 
on an average balance basis for the month of december  cash and due from banks increased million  or  from million in to million in other earning assets increased million  or  due to an increase in interest bearing deposits with other banks 
the corporation s interest bearing account with the federal reserve bank increased million  or  at december   primarily due to the investment of excess funds generated from an increase in demand and savings deposits  combined with a decrease in investments 
partially offsetting this increase was a million  or  decrease in loans held for sale  mainly due to the corporation s retention of certain residential mortgages in portfolio and a decrease in the volume of loans sold 
premises and equipment increased million  or 
the increase reflects additions primarily for the construction of new branch facilities and information technology initiatives  offset by depreciation and the sales of branch and office facilities during goodwill and intangible assets decreased million  or  due to the amortization of intangible assets 
other assets increased million  or  to million due primarily to a million increase in receivables related to investment securities sales that had not settled at year end 
as of december   the corporation had million of such receivables outstanding  compared to million as of december  also contributing to the increase in other assets was a million increase in tax credit investments and a million increase in net mortgage servicing rights 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in prepaid fdic assessments which were amortized to expense in  a million decrease in federal taxes receivable due to overpayments in and a million decrease in the fair value of mortgage banking derivative assets 
deposits and borrowings deposits increased million  or  to billion as of december  during  total non interest and interest bearing demand and savings deposits increased million  or  and time deposits decreased million  or 
non interest bearing accounts increased million  or  due primarily to a million  or  increase in business account balances 
interest bearing accounts increased million  or  due to a million  or  increase in municipal account balances  which was largely due to attractive interest rates for insured deposits relative to non bank alternatives  a million  or  increase in personal account balances and a million  or  increase in business account balances 
growth in business accounts was due  in part  to businesses maintaining higher balances to offset service fees  as well as a migration away from the corporation s cash management products due to the low interest rate environment 
the increase in personal accounts was primarily due to a migration from customer certificates of deposit 
the decrease in time deposits resulted from a million  or  decrease in customer certificates of deposit and a million  or  decrease in brokered certificates of deposit 
the decrease in customer certificates of deposit was in accounts with original maturity terms of less than two years of million  or  and jumbo accounts of million  or 
short term borrowings decreased million  or  due to a decrease in short term customer funding of million  or  and a decrease in federal funds purchased of million  or 
long term debt decreased million  or  as a result of the maturity of fhlb advances 
other liabilities other liabilities increased million  or 
the increase was primarily due to a million increase in the underfunded status of the corporation s defined benefit pension plan  which was largely the result of a basis point decrease in the discount rate used to calculate the projected benefit obligation 
also contributing to the increase in other liabilities was a million increase in dividends payable to common shareholders due to the increase in the corporation s fourth quarter dividend per share from per share in to cents in these increases were largely offset by a million decrease in payables related to investment security purchases executed prior to year end  but not settled until after year end 
shareholders equity total shareholders equity increased million  or  to billion  or of total assets as of december  the increase was primarily due to million of net income  partially offset by million of dividends on common shares outstanding 
due to the earnings improvement achieved throughout and the strength of its capital  the corporation increased its dividend to common shareholders to cents per share in  compared to cents per share in the corporation and its subsidiary banks are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by various banking regulators 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain actions by regulators that could have a material effect on the corporation s financial statements 
the regulations require that banks maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and tier i capital as defined in the regulations to risk weighted assets as defined  and tier i capital to average assets as defined 
as of december   the corporation and each of its bank subsidiaries met the minimum capital requirements 
in addition  all of the corporation s bank subsidiaries capital ratios exceeded the amounts required to be considered well capitalized as defined in the regulations

the basel committee on banking supervision basel is a committee of central banks and bank regulators from major industrialized countries that develops broad policy guidelines for use by each country s regulators with the purpose of ensuring that financial institutions have adequate capital given the risk levels of assets and off balance sheet financial instruments 
in december  basel released a framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation  referred to as basel iii 
basel iii includes defined minimum capital ratios  which must be met when implementation occurs on january  an additional capital conservation buffer will be phased in beginning january  and  when fully phased in three years later  the minimum ratios will be higher 
fully phased in capital standards under basel iii will require banks to maintain more capital than the minimum levels required under current regulatory capital standards 
the us banking regulators have not yet proposed regulations implementing basel iii  but are expected to do so in the near future 
as of december   the corporation met the fully phased in minimum capital ratios required for each of the capital measures included in basel iii 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements the corporation has various financial obligations that require future cash payments 
these obligations include the payment of liabilities recorded on the corporation s consolidated balance sheet as well as contractual obligations for purchased services or for operating leases 
the following table summarizes significant contractual obligations to third parties  by type  that were fixed and determinable as of december  payments due in one year or less one to three years three to five years over five years total in thousands deposits with no stated maturity time deposits short term borrowings long term debt operating leases purchase obligations uncertain tax positions includes demand deposits and savings accounts  which can be withdrawn by customers at any time

see additional information related to uncertain tax positions in note k  income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition to the contractual obligations listed in the preceding table  the corporation is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit  which involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk that are not recognized on the consolidated balance sheets 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the financial or performance obligation of a customer to a third party 
commitments and standby letters of credit do not necessarily represent future cash needs as they may expire without being drawn 
the following table presents the corporation s commitments to extend credit and letters of credit as of december  in thousands commercial mortgage and construction home equity commercial and other total commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit commercial letters of credit total letters of credit critical accounting policies the following is a summary of those accounting policies that the corporation considers to be most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations  as they require management s most difficult judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
fair value measurements fasb asc topic establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into the following three categories from highest to lowest priority level inputs that represent quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets 
level inputs that represent quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  or quoted prices for identical instruments in non active markets 
also includes valuation techniques whose inputs are derived principally from observable market data other than quoted prices  such as interest rates or other market corroborated means 
level inputs that are largely unobservable  as little or no market data exists for the instrument being valued 
the corporation has categorized all assets and liabilities measured at fair value both on a recurring and nonrecurring basis into the above three levels 
see note p  fair value measurements in the notes to consolidated financial statements for the disclosures required by fasb asc topic the determination of fair value for assets and liabilities categorized as level items involves a great deal of subjectivity due to the use of unobservable inputs 
in addition  determining when a market is no longer active and placing little or no reliance on distressed market prices requires the use of management s judgment 
the need for greater management judgment in determining fair values for level assets and liabilities has further been heightened by current economic conditions  which have created volatility in the fair values of certain investment securities 
the corporation engages third party valuation experts to assist in valuing most available for sale investment securities measured at fair value on a recurring basis which are classified as level or level items 
the pricing data and market quotes the corporation obtains from outside sources are reviewed internally for reasonableness 
allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses consists of the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date and is recorded as a reduction to loans 
the reserve for unfunded lending commitments represents management s estimate of losses inherent in its unfunded loan commitments and is recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
the allowance for credit losses is increased by charges to expense  through the provision for credit losses  and decreased by charge offs  net of recoveries 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments are adequate as of the balance sheet date  however  future changes to the allowance or reserve may be necessary based on changes in any of the factors discussed in the following paragraphs 
maintaining an adequate allowance for credit losses is dependent upon various factors  including the ability to identify potential problem loans in a timely manner 
for commercial loans  commercial mortgages and certain construction loans  an internal risk rating process  consisting of nine general classifications ranging from excellent to loss  is used 
risk ratings are initially assigned to loans by loan officers and are reviewed on a regular basis by loan review staff 
ratings change if the ongoing monitoring procedures or specific loan review activities identify a deterioration or an improvement in the loan 
while assigning risk ratings involves judgment  the risk rating process allows management to identify riskier credits in a timely manner and to allocate resources to managing troubled accounts 
the risk rating process is not practical for residential mortgages  home equity loans  consumer loans  installment loans and lease receivables  mainly because these portfolios consist of a larger number of loans with smaller balances 
instead  these portfolios are evaluated for risk mainly based on aggregate payment history  through the monitoring of delinquency levels and trends 
the corporation s established methodology for evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses considers both components of the allowance specific allowances allocated to loans evaluated for impairment under fasb asc section  and allowances calculated for pools of loans evaluated for impairment under fasb asc subtopic effective april   the corporation revised and enhanced its allowance for credit loss methodology 
the change in methodology resulted in shifts in allocations by loan type  however  the total allowance for credit losses did not change as a result of implementing the new methodology 
a loan is considered to be impaired if it is probable that all amounts will not be collected according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
beginning april   the population of loans evaluated for impairment under fasb asc section includes only loans on non accrual status and impaired troubled debt restructurings impaired tdrs 
impaired tdrs represent tdrs that were modified via a change in the interest rate that  at the time of restructuring  was favorable in comparison to rates offered for loans with similar risk characteristics  or days or more past due according to their modified terms  or modified in the current calendar year 
an allowance for loan losses is established for an impaired loan if its carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value 
impaired loans with balances greater than million are evaluated individually for impairment 
impaired loans with balances less than million are pooled and measured for impairment collectively 
beginning april   all loans evaluated for impairment under fasb asc section are measured for losses on a quarterly basis 
measurement may be on a more frequent basis if there is a significant change in the amount or timing of an impaired loan s expected future cash flows  if actual cash flows are significantly different from the cash flows previously projected  or if the fair value of an impaired loan s collateral significantly changes 
in addition  impaired loans secured predominately by real estate have updated certified third party appraisals  generally every months 
as of december  and  substantially all of the corporation s impaired loans with balances greater than million were measured based on the estimated fair value of each loan s collateral 
collateral could be in the form of real estate  in the case of impaired commercial mortgages and construction loans  or business assets  such as accounts receivable or inventory  in the case of commercial and industrial loans 
commercial and industrial loans may also be secured by real property 
for loans secured by real estate  estimated fair values are determined primarily through certified third party appraisals 
when a real estate secured loan becomes impaired  a decision is made regarding whether an updated certified appraisal of the real estate is necessary 
this decision is based on various considerations  including the age of the most recent appraisal  the loan to value ratio based on the original appraisal  the condition of the property  the corporation s experience and knowledge of the market  the purpose of the loan  environmental factors  payment status  the strength of any guarantors  and the existence and age of other indications of value such as broker price opinions  among others 
as of december  and  approximately and  respectively  of impaired loans secured by real estate with principal balances greater than million were measured at estimated fair value using certified third party appraisals that had been updated within the preceding months 
the fair value of collateral is generally based on appraised values  discounted to arrive at expected sale prices  net of estimated selling costs 
where updated certified appraisals are not obtained for loans evaluated for impairment under fasb asc section that are secured by real estate  fair values are estimated based on one or more of the following original appraisal if the original appraisal indicated a very strong loan to value position and  in the opinion of the corporation s internal loan evaluation staff  there has not been a significant deterioration in the collateral value  the original appraisal may be used to support the value of the collateral 
appropriate discounts are applied to the appraised value to adjust for market changes since the date the appraisal was completed  to arrive at an estimated selling price for the collateral 
original appraisals are typically used only when the estimated collateral value  as adjusted  results in a current loan to value ratio that is lower than the corporation s policy for new loans  generally 
broker price opinions in lieu of obtaining an updated certified appraisal  a less formal indication of value  such as a broker price opinion  may be obtained 
these opinions are generally used to validate internal estimates of collateral value and are not relied upon as the sole determinant of fair value 
discounted cash flows while substantially all of the corporation s impaired loans are measured based on the estimated fair value of collateral  discounted cash flows analyses may be used to validate estimates of collateral value derived from other approaches 
for impaired loans with principal balances greater than million secured by non real estate collateral  such as accounts receivable or inventory  estimated fair values are determined based on borrower financial statements  inventory listings  accounts receivable agings or borrowing base certificates 
indications of value from these sources are generally discounted based on the age of the financial information or the quality of the assets 
liquidation or collection discounts are applied to these assets based upon existing loan evaluation policies 
all loans not evaluated for impairment under fasb asc section are evaluated for impairment under fasb asc subtopic  using a pooled loss evaluation approach 
in general  these loans include residential mortgages  home equity loans  consumer loans  and lease receivables 
accruing commercial loans  commercial mortgages and construction loans are also evaluated for impairment under fasb asc subtopic the corporation evaluates loans for impairment under fasb asc subtopic through the following procedures the loans are segmented into pools with similar characteristics  such as general loan type  secured or unsecured and type of collateral 
commercial loans  commercial mortgages and certain construction loans are further segmented into separate pools based on internally assigned risk ratings 
residential mortgages  home equity loans  consumer loans  and lease receivables are further segmented into separate pools based on delinquency status 
a loss rate is calculated for each pool based on a probability of default pd and a loss given default lgd using historical losses as loans migrate through the various risk rating or delinquency categories 
the loss rate is adjusted to consider qualitative factors  such as economic conditions and trends 
the resulting adjusted loss rate is applied to the balance of the loans in the pool to arrive at the allowance allocation for the pool 
the allocation of the allowance for credit losses is reviewed to evaluate its appropriateness in relation to the overall risk profile of the loan portfolio 
the corporation considers risk factors such as local and national economic conditions  trends in delinquencies and non accrual loans  the diversity of borrower industry types  and the composition of the portfolio by loan type 
an unallocated allowance is maintained for factors and conditions that exist at the balance sheet date  but are not specifically identifiable  and to recognize the inherent imprecision in estimating and measuring loss exposure 
loans and lease financing receivables deemed to be a loss are written off through a charge against the allowance for credit losses 
closed end consumer loans are generally charged off when they become days past due days for open end consumer loans if they are not adequately secured by real estate 
all other loans are evaluated for possible charge off when it is probable that the balance will not be collected  based on the ability of the borrower to pay and the value of the underlying collateral 
recoveries of loans previously charged off are recorded as increases to the allowance for loan losses 
past due status is determined based on contractual due dates for loan payments 
see note a  summary of significant accounting policies and note d  loans and allowance for credit losses  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details 
troubled debt restructurings loans whose terms are modified are classified as troubled debt restructurings tdrs if the corporation grants the borrowers concessions and it is deemed that those borrowers are experiencing financial difficulty 
concessions granted under a tdr typically involve a temporary deferral of scheduled loan payments  an extension of a loan s stated maturity date or a reduction in the interest rate 
non accrual tdrs can be restored to accrual status if principal and interest payments  under the modified terms  are current for six consecutive months after modification 
tdrs are evaluated for impairment under fasb asc section effective july   the corporation adopted the provisions of asc update  a creditor s determination of whether a restructuring is a troubled debt restructuring 
asc update provides additional guidance for when a creditor has granted a concession and whether a debtor is experiencing financial difficulty 
this standards update was effective for the first interim or annual period beginning on or after june   and was applied retrospectively to january  the adoption of asc update did not impact the corporation s financial statements 
see note d  loans and allowance for credit losses  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details 
business combinations and intangible assets the corporation accounts for all business acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
purchase accounting requires that all assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including certain intangible assets that must be recognized  be recorded at their estimated fair values 
any purchase price exceeding the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized to expense  but is tested at least annually for impairment 
the corporation completes its annual goodwill impairment test as of october st of each year 
the corporation tests for impairment by first allocating its goodwill and other assets and liabilities  as necessary  to defined reporting units 
a fair value is then determined for each reporting unit 
if the fair values of the reporting units exceed their book values  no write down of the recorded goodwill is necessary 
if the fair values are less than the book values  an additional valuation procedure is necessary to assess the proper carrying value of the goodwill 
the corporation determined that no impairment charges were necessary in  or for additional details related to the goodwill impairment test  see note f  goodwill and intangible assets in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
reporting unit valuation is inherently subjective  with a number of factors based on assumptions and management judgments 
among these are future growth rates for the reporting units  selection of comparable market transactions  discount rates and earnings capitalization rates 
changes in assumptions and results due to economic conditions  industry factors and reporting unit performance and cash flow projections could result in different assessments of the fair values of reporting units and could result in impairment charges 
if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount  an interim impairment test is required 
such events may include adverse changes in legal factors or in the business climate  adverse actions by a regulator  unanticipated competition  the loss of key employees  or similar events 
intangible assets are amortized over their estimated lives 
some intangible assets have indefinite lives and are  therefore  not amortized 
all intangible assets must be evaluated for impairment if certain events occur 
any impairment write downs are recognized as expense on the consolidated statements of income 
income taxes the provision for income taxes is based upon income before income taxes  adjusted for the effect of certain tax exempt income  non deductible expenses and credits 
in addition  certain items of income and expense are reported in different periods for financial reporting and tax return purposes 
the tax effects of these temporary differences are recognized currently in the deferred income tax provision or benefit 
deferred tax assets or liabilities are computed based on the difference between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using the applicable enacted marginal tax rate 
the corporation must also evaluate the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income 
if any such assets are more likely than not to not be recovered  a valuation allowance must be recognized 
the corporation recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december  for certain state net operating losses and temporary differences that are not expected to be recovered 
the assessment of the carrying value of deferred tax assets is based on certain assumptions  changes in which could have a material impact on the corporation s consolidated financial statements 
the corporation accounts for uncertain tax positions by applying a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
recognition and measurement of tax positions is based on management s evaluations of relevant tax code and appropriate industry information about audit proceedings for comparable positions at other organizations 
virtually all of the corporation s unrecognized tax benefits are for positions that are taken on an annual basis on state tax returns 
increases to unrecognized tax benefits will occur as a result of accruing for the nonrecognition of the position for the current year 
decreases will occur as a result of the lapsing of the statute of limitations for the oldest outstanding year which includes the position

new accounting standards in may  the fasb issued asc update  amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss 
asc update amends fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap for the purpose of improving the comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
among the amendments in asc update are expanded disclosure requirements that require companies to quantitatively disclose inputs used in level fair value measurements and to disclose the sensitivity of fair value measurement to changes in unobservable inputs 
this standards update is effective for the first interim or annual period beginning on or after december  for the corporation  this standards update is effective in connection with its march  interim filing on form q 
the adoption of asc update is not expected to materially impact the corporation s financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued asc update  presentation of other comprehensive income 
asc update requires companies to present total comprehensive income  consisting of net income and other comprehensive income  in either one continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
presently  the corporation reports total comprehensive income within its consolidated statement of shareholders equity and comprehensive income loss 
for publicly traded entities  this standards update is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  for the corporation  this standards update is effective in connection with its march  interim filing on form q 
in december  the fasb issued asc update  deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 
asc update defers the effective date of the requirement to present separate line items on the income statement for reclassification adjustments of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income into net income under asc update this deferral is temporary until the fasb reconsiders the operational concerns and needs of financial statement users 
in september  the fasb issued asc update  testing for goodwill impairment 
asc update simplifies testing for goodwill impairment by permitting entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value 
if an entity can qualitatively demonstrate that a reporting unit s fair value is more likely than not greater than its carrying value  then it would not be required to perform the quantitative two step goodwill impairment test 
this standards update is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of asc update is not expected to materially impact the corporation s financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to economic loss that arises from changes in the values of certain financial instruments 
the types of market risk exposures generally faced by financial institutions include interest rate risk  equity market price risk  debt security market price risk  foreign currency price risk and commodity price risk 
due to the nature of its operations  only equity market price risk  debt security market price risk and interest rate risk are significant to the corporation 
equity market price risk equity market price risk is the risk that changes in the values of equity investments could have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations of the corporation 
as of december   the corporation s equity investments consisted of million of federal home loan bank fhlb and federal reserve bank stock  million of common stocks of publicly traded financial institutions and million of other equity investments 
the equity investments most susceptible to market price risk are the financial institutions stocks  which had a cost basis of million and a fair value of million as of december  gross unrealized gains and gross unrealized losses in this portfolio were approximately million and million as of december   respectively 
the corporation has evaluated whether any unrealized losses on individual equity investments constituted other than temporary impairment  which would require a write down through a charge to earnings 
based on the results of such evaluations  the corporation recorded write downs of million in  million in  and million in for financial institutions stocks which were deemed to exhibit other than temporary impairment in value 
in  the corporation also recorded a  other than temporary impairment charge for a mutual fund equity investment 
additional impairment charges may be necessary depending upon the performance of the equity markets in general and the performance of the individual investments held by the corporation 
see also note c  investment securities  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
management continuously monitors the fair value of its equity investments and evaluates current market conditions and operating results of the issuers 
periodic sale and purchase decisions are made based on this monitoring process 
none of the corporation s equity securities are classified as trading 
another source of equity market price risk is the corporation s investment in fhlb stock  which the corporation is required to own in order to borrow funds from the fhlb 
as of december   the corporation s investment in fhlb stock was million 
fhlbs obtain funding primarily through the issuance of consolidated obligations of the fhlb system 
the us government does not guarantee these obligations  and each of the fhlb banks is  generally  jointly and severally liable for repayment of each other s debt 
the fhlb system has experienced financial stress  and some of the regional banks within the fhlb system have suspended or reduced their dividends  or eliminated the ability of members to redeem capital stock 
the corporation s fhlb stock and its ability to obtain fhlb funds could be adversely impacted if the financial health of the fhlb system worsens 
in addition to its equity portfolio  the corporation s investment management and trust services income may be impacted by fluctuations in the equity markets 
a portion of this revenue is based on the value of the underlying investment portfolios  many of which include equity investments 
if the values of those investment portfolios decrease  whether due to factors influencing us securities markets in general or otherwise  the corporation s revenue would be negatively impacted 
in addition  the corporation s ability to sell its brokerage services in the future will be dependent  in part  upon consumers level of confidence in financial markets 
debt security market price risk debt security market price risk is the risk that changes in the values  unrelated to market price fluctuations related to interest rates changes  of debt securities could have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations of the corporation 
the corporation s debt security investments consist primarily of mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations  state and municipal securities  us government sponsored agency securities  us government debt securities  auction rate certificates and corporate debt securities 
all of the corporation s investments in mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations have principal payments that are guaranteed by us government sponsored agencies 
municipal securities as of december   the corporation had million of municipal securities issued by various municipalities in its investment portfolio 
ongoing uncertainty with respect to the financial viability of municipal insurers places much greater emphasis on the underlying strength of issuers 
continued pressure on local tax revenues of issuers due to adverse economic conditions could also have an adverse impact on the underlying strength of issuers 
the corporation evaluates existing and potential holdings primarily on the creditworthiness of the issuing municipality and then  to a lesser extent  on the underlying credit enhancement 
as of december   approximately of municipal securities were supported by the general obligation of corresponding municipalities 
in addition  approximately of these securities were school district issuances that are also supported by the states of the issuing municipalities 
auction rate certificates as of december   the corporation s investments in student loan auction rate securities  also known as auction rate certificates arcs  had a cost basis of million and a fair value of million 
arcs are long term securities that were structured to allow their sale in periodic auctions  resulting in both the treatment of arcs as short term instruments in normal market conditions and fair values that could be derived based on periodic auction prices 
however  beginning in  market auctions for these securities began to fail due to an insufficient number of buyers  resulting in an illiquid market 
this illiquidity has resulted in recent market prices that represent forced liquidations or distressed sales and do not provide an accurate basis for fair value 
therefore  as of december   the fair values of the arcs were derived using significant unobservable inputs based on an expected cash flows model which produced fair values which were materially different from those that would be expected from settlement of these investments in the illiquid market that presently exists 
the expected cash flow model  prepared by a third party valuation expert  produced fair values which assumed a return to market liquidity sometime within the next three years 
the credit quality of the underlying debt associated with the arcs is also a factor in the determination of their estimated fair value 
as of december   approximately million  or  of the arcs were rated above investment grade  with approximately million  or  aaa rated 
approximately million  or  of arcs were either not rated or rated below investment grade by at least one ratings agency 
of this amount  approximately million  or  of the loans underlying these arcs have principal payments which are guaranteed by the federal government 
in total  approximately million  or  of the loans underlying the arcs have principal payments which are guaranteed by the federal government 
at december   all arcs were current and making scheduled interest payments 
during the year ended december   the corporation recorded  of other than temporary impairment charges for two individual arcs based on an expected cash flow model 
as of december   after other than temporary impairment charges  the two other than temporarily impaired arcs had a cost basis of million and a fair value of million 
these other than temporarily impaired arcs have principal payments supported by non guaranteed private student loans  as opposed to federally guaranteed student loans 
the student loans underlying these other than temporarily impaired arcs had actual defaults of approximately  resulting in an erosion of parity ratios  which is calculated as the outstanding principal and capitalized interest of the student loans divided by the amount outstanding of the notes 
parity ratios for these other than temporarily impaired arcs were approximately as of december  additional impairment charges for arcs may be necessary depending upon the performance of the individual investments held by the corporation 
corporate debt securities the corporation holds corporate debt securities in the form of pooled trust preferred securities  single issuer trust preferred securities and subordinated debt issued by financial institutions  as presented in the following table december  amortized cost estimated fair value in thousands single issuer trust preferred securities subordinated debt pooled trust preferred securities corporate debt securities issued by financial institutions the fair values for pooled trust preferred securities and certain single issuer trust preferred securities were based on quotes provided by third party brokers who determined fair values based predominantly on internal valuation models which were not indicative prices or binding offers 
the corporation s investments in single issuer trust preferred securities had an unrealized loss of million as of december  the corporation did not record any other than temporary impairment charges for single issuer trust preferred securities in  or the corporation held single issuer trust preferred securities that were rated below investment grade by at least one ratings agency  with an amortized cost of million and an estimated fair value of million as of december  the majority of the single issuer trust preferred securities rated below investment grade were rated bb or ba 
single issuer trust preferred securities with an amortized cost of million and an estimated fair value of million as of december  were not rated by any ratings agency 
the corporation held ten pooled trust preferred securities as of december  nine of these securities  with an amortized cost of million and an estimated fair value of million  were rated below investment grade by at least one ratings agency  with ratings ranging from c to ca 
for each of the nine pooled trust preferred securities rated below investment grade  the class of securities held by the corporation was below the most senior tranche  with the corporation s interests being subordinate to other investors in the pool 
the amortized cost of pooled trust preferred securities is the purchase price of the securities  net of cumulative credit related other than temporary impairment charges  determined using an expected cash flow model 
the most significant input to the expected cash flow model is the expected payment deferral rate for each pooled trust preferred security 
the corporation evaluates the financial metrics  such as capital ratios and non performing asset ratios  of the individual financial institution issuers that comprise each pooled trust preferred security to estimate its expected deferral rate 
the actual weighted average cumulative defaults and deferrals as a percentage of original collateral were approximately as of december  the discounted cash flow modeling for pooled trust preferred securities held by the corporation as of december  assumed  on average  an additional expected deferral rate 
additional impairment charges for corporate debt securities issued by financial institutions may be necessary in the future depending upon the performance of the individual investments held by the corporation 
see note c  investment securities  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion related to the corporation s other than temporary impairment evaluations for debt securities and see note p  fair value measurements  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion related to the fair values of debt securities 
interest rate risk  asset liability management and liquidity interest rate risk creates exposure in two primary areas 
first  changes in rates have an impact on the corporation s liquidity position and could affect its ability to meet obligations and continue to grow 
second  movements in interest rates can create fluctuations in the corporation s net interest income and changes in the economic value of its equity 
the corporation employs various management techniques to minimize its exposure to interest rate risk 
an asset liability management committee alco  consisting of key financial and senior management personnel  meets on a regular basis 
the alco is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position of the corporation  approving asset and liability management policies  and overseeing the formulation and implementation of strategies regarding balance sheet positions and earnings 
from a liquidity standpoint  the corporation must maintain a sufficient level of liquid assets to meet the cash needs of its customers  who  as depositors  may want to withdraw funds or who  as borrowers  need credit availability 
liquidity is provided on a continuous basis through scheduled and unscheduled principal and interest payments on outstanding loans and investments and through the availability of deposits and borrowings 
the corporation also maintains secondary sources that provide liquidity on a secured and unsecured basis to meet short term and long term needs 
the consolidated statements of cash flows provide details related to the corporation s sources and uses of cash 
the corporation generated million in cash from operating activities during  mainly due to net income  as adjusted for non cash charges  most notably the provision for credit losses 
investing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of million in due to a net increase in loans and short term investments  partially offset by sales and maturities of investments exceeding reinvestments in the portfolio 
financing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of million in as a result of repayments of short term borrowings and long term debt and dividends paid on common shares outstanding exceeding cash inflows from deposit increases and additions to long term debt 
liquidity must also be managed at the fulton financial corporation parent company level 
for safety and soundness reasons  banking regulations limit the amount of cash that can be transferred from subsidiary banks to the parent company in the form of loans and dividends 
generally  these limitations are based on the subsidiary banks regulatory capital levels and their net income 
the parent company meets its cash needs through dividends and loans from subsidiary banks  and through external borrowings  if necessary 
management continuously monitors the liquidity and capital needs of the parent company and will implement appropriate strategies  as necessary  to meet regulatory capital requirements and to meet its cash needs 
as of december   liquid assets defined as cash and due from banks  short term investments  deposits in other financial institutions  federal funds sold  mortgages available for sale  securities available for sale  and non mortgage backed securities held to maturity due in one year or less totaled billion  or of total assets  as compared to billion  or of total assets  as of december  the following tables present the expected maturities of investment securities as of december  and the weighted average yields of such securities calculated based on historical cost held to maturity at amortized cost maturing within one year after one but within five years after five but within ten years after ten years amount yield amount yield amount yield amount yield dollars in thousands us government sponsored agency securities state and municipal total mortgage backed securities available for sale at estimated fair value maturing within one year after one but within five years after five but within ten years after ten years amount yield amount yield amount yield amount yield dollars in thousands us government securities us government sponsored agency securities state and municipal auction rate securities corporate debt securities total collateralized mortgage obligations mortgage backed securities weighted average yields on tax exempt securities have been computed on a fully taxable equivalent basis assuming a tax rate of and statutory interest expense disallowances 
maturities for mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are dependent upon the interest rate environment and prepayments on the underlying loans 
for the purpose of this table  the entire balance and weighted average rate is shown in one period 
includes small business administration securities  whose maturities are dependent upon prepayments on the underlying loans 
for the purpose of this table  amounts are based upon contractual maturities 
maturities of auction rate securities are based on contractual maturities 
the corporation s investment portfolio consists mainly of mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations which have stated maturities that may differ from actual maturities due to borrowers ability to prepay obligations 
cash flows from such investments are dependent upon the performance of the underlying mortgage loans and are generally influenced by the level of interest rates 
as rates increase  cash flows generally decrease as prepayments on the underlying mortgage loans decrease 
as rates decrease  cash flows generally increase as prepayments increase 
the following table presents the approximate contractual maturity and interest rate sensitivity of certain loan types subject to changes in interest rates as of december  one year or less one through five years more than five years total in thousands commercial  financial and agricultural adjustable and floating rate fixed rate total real estate mortgage adjustable and floating rate fixed rate total real estate construction adjustable and floating rate fixed rate total includes commercial mortgages  residential mortgages and home equity loans 
contractual maturities of time deposits of  or more outstanding as of december  are as follows in thousands three months or less over three through six months over six through twelve months over twelve months total the corporation maintains liquidity sources in the form of core demand and savings deposits  time deposits in various denominations  including jumbo and brokered time deposits  repurchase agreements and short term promissory notes 
borrowing availability with the fhlb and federal reserve bank  along with federal funds lines at various correspondent banks  provides the corporation with additional liquidity 
each of the corporation s subsidiary banks is a member of the fhlb and has access to fhlb overnight and term credit facilities 
as of december   the corporation had million of term advances outstanding from the fhlb with an additional borrowing capacity of approximately million of under these facilities 
a combination of commercial real estate loans  commercial loans and securities are pledged to the federal reserve bank of philadelphia to provide access to the federal reserve bank discount window borrowings 
as of december   the corporation had billion of collateralized borrowing availability at the discount window  and no outstanding borrowings

the preceding table and discussion addressed the liquidity implications of interest rate risk and focused on expected cash flows from financial instruments 
expected maturities  however  do not necessarily reflect the net interest impact of interest rate changes 
certain financial instruments  such as adjustable rate loans  have repricing periods that differ from expected cash flow periods 
included within the billion of floating rate loans above are billion of loans  or of the total  that float with the prime interest rate  billion  or  of loans which float with other interest rates  primarily the london interbank offered rate libor  and billion  or  of adjustable rate loans 
the billion of adjustable rate loans include loans that are fixed rate instruments for a certain period of time  and then convert to floating rates 
the following table presents the percentage of adjustable rate loans  at december   stratified by the period until their next repricing fixed rate term percent of total adjustable rate loans one year two years three years four years five years greater than five years as of december   approximately billion of loans had interest rate floors  with approximately billion priced at their interest rate floor 
of this total  approximately billion are scheduled to reprice during the next twelve months 
the weighted average interest rate increase that would be necessary for these loans to begin repricing to higher rates was approximately 
the corporation uses three complementary methods to measure and manage interest rate risk 
they are static gap analysis  simulation of earnings  and estimates of economic value of equity 
using these measurements in tandem provides a reasonably comprehensive summary of the magnitude of the corporation s interest rate risk  level of risk as time evolves  and exposure to changes in interest rates 
static gap provides a measurement of repricing risk in the corporation s balance sheet as of a point in time 
this measurement is accomplished through stratification of the corporation s assets and liabilities into repricing periods 
the sum of assets and liabilities in each of these periods are compared for mismatches within that maturity segment 
core deposits having no contractual maturities are placed into repricing periods based upon historical balance performance 
repricing for mortgage loans  mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are based on expected cash flows which include the effects of expected prepayments as determined based upon industry projections for prepayment speeds 
the corporation s policy limits the cumulative six month ratio of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities rsa rsl to a range of to 
as of december   the cumulative six month ratio of rsa rsl was 
simulation of net interest income and net income is performed for the next twelve month period 
a variety of interest rate scenarios are used to measure the effects of sudden and gradual movements upward and downward in the yield curve 
these results are compared to the results obtained in a flat or unchanged interest rate scenario 
simulation of earnings is used primarily to measure the corporation s short term earnings exposure to interest rate movements 
the corporation s policy limits the potential exposure of net interest income to of the base case net interest income for a basis point shock in interest rates  for a basis point shock and for a basis point shock 
a shock is an immediate upward or downward movement of interest rates across the yield curve 
the shocks do not take into account changes in customer behavior that could result in changes to mix and or volumes in the balance sheet nor do they account for competitive pricing over the forward month period 
the following table summarizes the expected impact of interest rate shocks on net interest income due to the current level of interest rates  the and basis point downward shock scenarios are not shown rate shock annual change in net interest income change bp million bp million bp million bp million because certain current interest rates are at or below  the basis point downward shock assumes that certain corresponding interest rates approach an implied floor that  in effect  reflects a decrease of less than the full basis point downward shock 
economic value of equity estimates the discounted present value of asset and liability cash flows 
discount rates are based upon market prices for like assets and liabilities 
upward and downward shocks of interest rates are used to determine the comparative effect of such interest rate movements relative to the unchanged environment 
this measurement tool is used primarily to evaluate the longer term repricing risks and options in the corporation s balance sheet 
a policy limit of of economic equity may be at risk for every basis point shock movement in interest rates 
as of december   the corporation was within economic value of equity policy limits for every basis point shock movement in interest rates
