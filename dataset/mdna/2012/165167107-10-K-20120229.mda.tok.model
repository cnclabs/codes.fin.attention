table of contents b natural gas equivalent is based on six mcf of natural gas to one barrel of oil 
this ratio reflects an energy content equivalency and not a price or revenue equivalency 
given recent commodity prices  the price for an mcfe of natural gas is significantly less than the price for an mcfe of oil or ngls

d includes the effects of realized gains losses from interest rate derivatives  but excludes the effects of unrealized gains losses and is net of amounts capitalized 
we manage our business as three separate operational segments exploration and production  marketing  gathering and compression  and oilfield services 
we refer you to note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report  which summarizes by segment our net income and capital expenditures for  and and our assets as of december   and executive summary we are the second largest producer of natural gas  a top producer of liquids and the most active driller of new wells in the us we own interests in approximately  producing natural gas and oil wells that are currently producing approximately bcfe per day  net to our interest 
the company has built a large resource base of onshore us natural gas assets in the haynesville and bossier shales in northwestern louisiana and east texas  the marcellus shale in the northern appalachian basin of west virginia and pennsylvania  the barnett shale in the fort worth basin of north central texas  and the pearsall shale in south texas 
in addition  we have built leading positions in the liquids rich resource plays of the eagle ford shale in south texas  the utica shale in ohio and pennsylvania  the granite wash  cleveland  tonkawa and mississippi lime plays in the anadarko basin in western oklahoma and the texas panhandle  the bone spring  avalon  wolfcamp and wolfberry plays in the permian and delaware basins in west texas and southern new mexico  and the niobrara shale in the powder river basin in wyoming 
we have also vertically integrated many of our operations and own substantial midstream  compression and oilfield services assets as discussed under business strategy in item proved reserves 
chesapeake began with estimated proved reserves of tcfe and ended with tcfe as of december   an increase of tcfe  or 
the proved reserve movement included tcfe of production  tcfe of extensions  bcfe of negative performance revisions to previous estimates and bcfe of positive revisions resulting from higher oil prices using the average first day of the month price for the twelve months ended december   compared to the twelve months ended december  during  we acquired bcfe of estimated proved reserves and divested tcfe of estimated proved reserves  including the disposition of tcfe associated with the sale of our fayetteville shale assets in march as described below under steps taken in to implement our business strategy 
the bcfe of negative revisions to previous estimates consisted of bcfe of negative revisions associated with the deletion of puds no longer consistent with our development plans  offset by bcfe of positive revisions to producing properties and proved undeveloped reserves estimates 
drilling and completion expenditures 
during  we invested billion in operated wells using an average of operated rigs and billion in non operated wells using an average of non operated rigs for total drilling and completing costs on proved and unproved properties of billion  net of drilling and completion carries of billion 
production 
our total production of tcfe consisted of tcf of natural gas on a natural gas equivalent basis and mmbbls of liquids on a natural gas equivalent basis 
daily production for averaged bcfe  an increase of mmcfe  or  over the bcfe produced per day in this was our nd consecutive year of sequential production growth 

table of contents in  chesapeake has curtailed its natural gas production approximately bcf per day of gross operated natural gas production  or approximately of us lower natural gas production  in response to continued low natural gas prices and as an effort to help bring us natural gas supply and demand into better balance 
the curtailed volumes are located primarily in the haynesville and barnett shale plays 
in addition  wherever possible  the company is deferring completions of dry gas wells that have been drilled  but not yet completed  and is also deferring pipeline connections of dry gas wells that have already been completed 
as a result of production curtailments and reduced drilling and completion activity  partially offset by growth in associated natural gas production in liquids rich plays  chesapeake projects that its net natural gas production will average approximately bcf per day  a decrease of mmcf per day  or  compared to the company s average net natural gas production of bcf per day 
leasehold and seismic inventories 
since  chesapeake has built the largest combined inventories of onshore leasehold million net acres and d seismic million acres in the us we have accumulated the largest inventory of us natural gas shale play leasehold million net acres and own a leading position in of what we believe are the top unconventional liquids rich plays in the us we are currently using operated drilling rigs to further develop our inventory of approximately  net drillsites 
the company is targeting to invest approximately billion in net undeveloped leasehold expenditures in  of which approximately will be in liquids rich plays and will be in plays where the company is already active 
this compares to net undeveloped leasehold expenditures of approximately billion and billion in and  respectively 
emphasis on increasing liquids production 
in recognition of the value gap between liquids and natural gas prices  chesapeake has directed a significant portion of its technological and leasehold acquisition expertise during the past three years to identify  secure and commercialize new unconventional liquids rich plays 
this planned transition will result in a more balanced and likely more profitable portfolio between natural gas and liquids 
to date  we have built leasehold positions and established production in multiple liquids rich plays on approximately million net acres with million bbls of oil equivalent of proved reserves 
our production of liquids averaged  bbls per day during  a increase over the average during  as a result of the increased development of our unconventional liquids rich plays 
we are projecting that the portion of our operated drilling and completion expenditures allocated to liquids development will reach in  and we expect to increase our liquids production through our drilling activities to an average of approximately  bbls per day in and to more than  bbls per day in and  bbls per day by other operational segments 
in addition to our exploration and production operational segment  we also have a marketing  gathering and compression operational segment and an oilfield services operational segment that we utilize as a financial and operational hedge against inflation and to assure that we have access to quality services 
in october  we formally segregated our oilfield services businesses under our wholly owned subsidiary  cos  and its wholly owned subsidiary coo 
coo s subsidiaries include a leading us drilling contractor  oilfield trucking company  oilfield rental tool provider and a developing pressure pumping business 
in september  we formally segregated our midstream gathering services under a wholly owned subsidiary  cmd  and it has engaged in significant sales transactions with our affiliate midstream master limited partnership 
these segments are separately capitalized  each with its own revolving bank credit facility  and coo issued senior notes in 
table of contents steps taken in to implement our business strategy our business strategy is to create value for investors by building and developing one of the largest onshore natural gas and liquids resource bases in the us the key elements of our business strategy  as described in business strategy in item  are the following growing production and proved reserves through the drillbit  controlling substantial land and drilling location inventories and building operating focus and scale  developing proprietary technological advantages  focusing on achieving low costs through our focused activities  vertical integration and increasing scale  mitigating natural gas and oil price risk through our hedging program  entering into value creating joint ventures  improving our balance sheet through reduction of debt  transforming the us transportation fuels market and increasing demand for us natural gas  and maintaining an entrepreneurial culture 
below we describe significant activities in that evidence our commitment to our business strategy 
joint ventures 
in february  we entered into a joint venture with a wholly owned subsidiary of cnooc limited cnooc to sell a undivided interest in approximately  net acres of leasehold overlaying the niobrara shale  codell sand and various other formations in the powder river and dj basins in northeast colorado and southeast wyoming 
under the terms of the joint venture  we received million in cash at closing  and cnooc has agreed to fund of our share of drilling and completion costs until an additional million has been paid  which we expect to occur by year end cnooc has the right to a participation in any additional leasehold we acquire in the joint venture area of mutual interest at cost plus a fee 
in december  we entered into a joint venture with total e p  usa  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of total sa total  in the liquids rich area of the utica shale 
under the terms of the joint venture  total acquired an undivided interest in approximately  net acres of leasehold  of which chesapeake contributed approximately  net acres and enervest  ltd 
contributed approximately  net acres to the joint venture  covering all or a portion of counties in eastern ohio 
we received approximately million in cash at closing and approximately billion will be paid in the form of a drilling and completion cost carry  which we anticipate fully receiving by year end in addition  total will acquire a share in any additional acreage we acquire in the joint venture area of mutual interest at cost plus a fee 
as of december   including the joint ventures described above  we had entered into seven significant joint ventures with other leading energy companies pursuant to which we sold a portion of our leasehold  producing properties and other assets located in seven different resource plays and received cash of billion and commitments for future drilling and completion cost sharing of billion 
in each of these joint ventures  chesapeake serves as the operator and conducts all 
table of contents leasing  drilling  completion  operations and marketing activities for the project 
these transactions have allowed us to recover much or all of our initial leasehold investments and reduce our ongoing capital costs in these plays 
the transactions are detailed below

as a result  in october  we received million in cash from tot  which included million of carry obligation billed and million for the remaining carry obligation 
in january  chesapeake and tot agreed to reduce the minimum rig count from to six rigs 
d in september  pxp accelerated the payment of its remaining carry in exchange for an approximate reduction to the remaining drilling carry obligation owed to us at that time 
the drilling and completion carries in our joint venture agreements create a significant cost advantage that allows us to reduce our future finding costs 
during and  our drilling and completion costs included the benefit of approximately billion and billion  respectively  of drilling and completion carries 
our drilling and completion costs for  and will continue to be partially offset by the use of our remaining drilling and completion carries associated with our joint venture agreements 
during  as part of our joint venture agreements with cnooc  tot  sto and pxp  we sold interests in additional leasehold in the niobrara  eagle ford and pearsall  barnett  marcellus and haynesville and bossier shale plays for proceeds of approximately million that had an estimated cost to us of approximately million 
the cash proceeds from these transactions are reflected as a reduction of natural gas and oil properties with no gain or loss recognized 
fayetteville shale asset monetization 
in march  we sold all of our fayetteville shale assets in central arkansas to bhp billiton petroleum  a wholly owned subsidiary of bhp billiton limited  for net proceeds of approximately billion in cash 
the sold properties consisted of approximately  net acres of leasehold  net production at closing of approximately mcfe per day and midstream assets consisting of approximately miles of pipeline 
as part of the transaction  we 
table of contents agreed to provide technical and business services for up to one year for bhp billiton s fayetteville properties for an agreed upon fee 
we used a portion of the funds we received from the fayetteville transaction to purchase outstanding debt as described below 
purchases of senior debt 
in may  we completed tender offers to purchase billion in aggregate principal amount of certain of our senior notes and million in aggregate principal amount of certain of our contingent convertible senior notes 
these tender offers were part of our plan to reduce the amount of our outstanding indebtedness by in the two year period ending december  we funded the purchase of the notes with a portion of the net proceeds we received from the monetization of our fayetteville shale assets 
combined with the million in aggregate principal amount of contingent convertible senior notes we purchased in privately negotiated transactions  we retired an aggregate principal amount of billion of senior notes and contingent convertible senior notes in volumetric production payment vpp 
in may  we monetized certain of our producing assets in the mid continent through a ten year vpp for proceeds of approximately million 
the transaction included approximately bcfe of proved reserves and approximately mmcfe per day of net production 
chesapeake has retained drilling rights on the properties below currently producing intervals and outside of existing producing wellbores and we also retain all production beyond the specified volumes sold in the transaction 
this transaction was our ninth vpp 
the cash proceeds for this transaction were reflected as a reduction of natural gas and oil properties with no gain or loss recognized 
other vpps we completed in are detailed in note of the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
bronco drilling acquisition 
as an extension of our oilfield services vertical integration strategy  in june we acquired bronco drilling company  inc  a publicly traded company  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  or per share of bronco common stock 
the acquisition included high quality drilling rigs primarily operating in the williston and anadarko basins which were transferred to our drilling subsidiary  nomac drilling  llc cngv investments 
in july  cngv  a wholly owned subsidiary  made its first two investments in companies and technologies that we believe have the potential to replace the use of gasoline and diesel derived primarily from imported oil with domestic oil  natural gas and natural gas to liquids fuels 
we agreed to invest million in newly issued convertible promissory notes of clean energy fuels corp 
nasdaq clne  based in seal beach  california 
the investment will be made in three equal million promissory notes  the first of which was issued in july  with the remaining notes scheduled to be issued in june and june the notes bear interest at the annual rate of  payable quarterly  and are convertible at our option into shares of clean energy s common stock at a conversion premium  resulting in a conversion price of per share 
if certain requirements have been met following the second anniversary of the issuance of a note  clean energy can force conversion of the debt 
the entire principal balance of each note is due and payable seven years following issuance 
clean energy will use our million investment to accelerate its build out of lng fueling infrastructure for heavy duty trucks at truck stops across interstate highways in the us also in july  cngv agreed to invest million in preferred equity securities of sundrop fuels  inc  a privately held cellulosic biofuels company based in louisville  colorado 
the investment over the next two years will fund construction of a waste biomass based green gasoline plant  capable of annually producing more than million gallons of gasoline from natural gas and cellulosic material 
the investment is intended to accelerate the development of an affordable  stable  room temperature  natural gas based fuel for immediate use in automobiles  diesel engine vehicles and aircraft 
the first million tranche of our investment was funded in july and the remaining 
table of contents tranches of preferred equity investment will be scheduled around certain funding and operational milestones that are expected to be reached over the next two years 
the full investment will represent approximately of sundrop fuels equity on a fully diluted basis 
oilfield services capitalization 
in october  our wholly owned subsidiary  coo  issued million principal amount of senior notes due in a private placement 
coo used a portion of the net proceeds of approximately million from the placement to make a cash distribution to its direct parent  cos  to enable it to reduce indebtedness under an intercompany note with chesapeake 
chesapeake used the cash distribution to repay outstanding indebtedness under its corporate revolving bank credit facility 
in november  coo established a five year syndicated revolving bank credit facility with million in total commitments we estimate the capacity was limited to approximately million as of december  by certain restrictive provisions 
borrowings under the credit facility are secured by liens on all of the equity interests of coo and coo s current and future guarantor subsidiaries and all of their assets  including real and personal property 
utica financial transaction 
chk utica  llc chk utica is an unrestricted  non guarantor consolidated subsidiary we formed in october to develop a portion of our utica shale natural gas and oil assets 
in exchange for all of the common shares  we contributed to chk utica approximately  net acres of leasehold within an area of mutual interest in the utica shale play covering counties located primarily in eastern ohio 
during november and december  in private placements  third party investors contributed billion in cash to chk utica in exchange for i million chk utica preferred shares  and ii our obligation to deliver a overriding royalty interest orri in up to  net wells to be drilled on certain of our utica shale leasehold 
dividends on the preferred shares are payable on a quarterly basis at a rate of per annum based on  per share 
this dividend rate is subject to increase in limited circumstances in the event that  and only for so long as  cash flow from the assets owned by chk utica are insufficient to fund the dividend in full in any quarter 
we have committed to drill  for the benefit of chk utica  a minimum of net wells per year through in the chk utica area of mutual interest  up to a minimum cumulative total of net wells 
as the managing member of chk utica  we may  at our sole discretion and election at any time after december   distribute certain excess cash of chk utica 
if we are current in our drilling commitment at the time  any such optional distribution of excess cash is allocated to the preferred shares which is applied toward redemption of the preferred shares and to the common shares 
we may also cause chk utica to redeem the chk utica preferred shares for cash  in whole or in part  at a valuation equal to the greater of a internal rate of return or a return on investment of x  in each case inclusive of dividends paid at the rate of per annum and optional distributions made through the applicable redemption date 
in the event that redemption does not occur on or prior to october   the optional redemption valuation increases to the greater of a internal rate of return or a return on investment of x 
as of december   the redemption price  and the liquidation preference  was  per preferred share 
chk utica is responsible for all capital and operating costs of the wells drilled for the benefit of the entity 
chk utica also receives its proportionate share of the benefit of the drilling carry associated with our joint venture with total in the utica shale

royalty trust 
in november  the chesapeake granite wash trust the trust  a newly formed delaware statutory trust  completed its initial public offering of  common units representing an approximate beneficial interest in the trust 
net proceeds to the trust  after certain offering expenses  were approximately million 
concurrent with the closing  we conveyed certain royalty interests to the trust in exchange for the net proceeds of the trust s initial public offering and  units  common units and  subordinated units representing approximately of the beneficial interest in the trust 
the royalty interests conveyed by chesapeake will entitle the trust to a percentage of the proceeds received by chesapeake from the production of hydrocarbons from producing wells and development wells to be drilled by

marcellus gathering system sale 
in december  our wholly owned midstream subsidiary  cmd  sold its wholly owned subsidiary  ams  which held substantially all of our marcellus shale midstream assets  to our affiliate  chkm  for total consideration of million  subject to a customary post closing working capital adjustment 
at closing  we received cash of million and  common units of chkm that had a value at closing of million 
the stock consideration increased our ownership in chkm from to 
the assets sold included an approximate ownership of an integrated system of assets that consist of miles of pipeline in the marcellus shale 
in addition  cmd has committed to pay chkm any quarterly shortfall between the actual ebitda from the assets sold and specified quarterly targets  which total million in and million in we  and other producers in the area  have year fixed fee gathering and compression agreements with ams that include significant acreage dedications and an annual fee redetermination 
capital expenditures our exploration  development and acquisition activities require us to make substantial capital expenditures 
our current budgeted drilling and completion expenditures  net of drilling and completion carries  are billion in  compared to billion in our operated dry gas drilling expenditures in  net of drilling and completion cost carries  are expected to decrease to billion  a decrease of approximately from similar expenditures of billion in and the company s lowest expenditures on dry gas plays since we are projecting that the portion of our operated drilling and completion expenditures allocated to liquids development will reach in our projected capital expenditures for our growing midstream and oilfield services businesses are billion  and we are targeting to invest approximately billion in net undeveloped leasehold expenditures in  of which approximately will be in liquids rich plays and will be in plays where the company is already active 
this compares to net undeveloped leasehold expenditures of approximately billion and billion in and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity overview as discussed in recent developments  in item  we anticipate funding our drilling and completion expenditures  and other capital expenditures  including leasehold acquisitions  using a combination of cash flow from operations and proceeds from asset monetizations  including joint ventures  volumetric production payments  financial transactions and other property and investment dispositions in in addition  since early  it has been our plan to reduce our long term debt to no more than billion at december   a reduction from year end  and increase our production by during the two years ended december  
table of contents we expect that the proceeds from our planned monetization transactions  which we estimate could be billion  will be sufficient to fund our budgeted capital expenditures  meet our long term debt reduction plans by year end and provide additional liquidity for we are also projecting that our increasing liquids production will enable us to reach equilibrium between our cash flow from operations and planned drilling and completion expenditures in we do not have binding agreements for any of these transactions  however  and our ability to consummate each of them is subject to changes in market conditions and other factors 
as a result  there can be no assurance that we will complete any of the announced transactions on a timely basis or at all 
if we are unable to consummate these transactions or if they do not generate the proceeds we are anticipating  we would be required to seek funds from other sources 
our ability to obtain capital from asset monetizations is dependent upon many factors  and they may be beyond our control 
if our access to alternative asset monetizations were limited  we could be required to reduce our capital spending  which could reduce our ability to develop and replace our reserves 
through the vertical integration of our business and as operator of a substantial number of our properties under development  we retain significant control and flexibility over the development plan and the associated timing  which we believe is instrumental to our business plan and strategy 
while our capital raising activities enabled us to fund our capital program in and pursue our goal of long term debt reduction  certain recent transactions require us to meet performance obligations and we have significant other contractual cash obligations to third parties pursuant to various lease arrangements  gathering  processing  and transportation agreements  drilling commitments  leasehold maintenance arrangements  fleet utilization agreements  and investments in new ventures see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
while our business plan assumes that we will meet these commitments in the ordinary course of business  we are required to meet our performance and payment obligations regardless of whether our business plan changes for circumstances beyond our control 
sources of funds cash flow from operations is a significant source of liquidity we use to fund capital expenditures  pay dividends and repay debt 
cash provided by operating activities was billion in  compared to billion in and billion in changes in cash flow from operations are largely due to the same factors that affect our net income  excluding various non cash items such as depreciation  depletion and amortization  deferred income taxes  mark to market changes in our derivative instruments and gains or losses on the sales and impairments of fixed assets 
see the discussion below under results of operations 
changes in market prices for natural gas and oil directly impact our cash flow from operations 
to mitigate the risk of declines in natural gas and oil prices and to provide more predictable future cash flow from operations  we have entered into various derivative instruments 
as natural gas and oil prices dip and reach supportable low prices  however  we may take the opportunity to close out open swap positions in order to lock in substantial mark to market gains 
for example  during  we elected to close all our natural gas swap positions thereby locking in approximately million of gains for and positioning us to be able to react to market increases in the future by potentially adding new positions  although also exposing us to declining prices if we are unhedged 
our natural gas and oil derivatives as of december  are detailed in item a of this report 
depending on changes in natural gas and oil futures markets and management s view of underlying natural gas and oil supply and demand trends  we may increase or decrease our current derivative positions 
cash settlements of our derivative instruments are generally classified as operating cash flows unless the derivative is deemed to contain  for accounting purposes  a significant financing element at contract inception  in which case these cash settlements are classified as financing cash flows 
in  and  we received billion  million and million  respectively  for settlements of derivatives which were classified as cash flows from financing activities

we refer you to the table under investing activities below  which sets forth the components of our natural gas and oil investing activities and our other investing activities for  and we retain a significant degree of control over the timing of our capital expenditures which permits us to defer or accelerate certain capital expenditures if necessary to address any potential liquidity issues 
in addition  changes in drilling and field operating costs  drilling results that alter planned development schedules  acquisitions or other factors could cause us to revise our drilling program  which is largely discretionary 
in may  we completed and settled tender offers to purchase the following senior notes and contingent convertible senior notes in order to reduce the amount of our outstanding indebtedness

we use this facility for the majority of our natural gas  oil and natural gas liquids derivatives 
our accounts receivable are primarily from purchasers of natural gas and oil billion at december  and exploration and production companies which own interests in properties we operate billion at december  
this industry concentration has the potential to impact our overall exposure to credit risk  either positively or negatively  in that our customers and joint working interest owners may be similarly affected by changes in economic  industry or other conditions 
we generally require letters of credit or parent guarantees for receivables from parties which are judged to have sub standard credit  unless the credit risk can otherwise be mitigated

our credit facilities do not contain material adverse change or adequate assurance covenants 
although the applicable interest rates under our corporate credit facility fluctuate slightly based on our long term senior unsecured credit ratings  our credit facilities do not contain provisions which would trigger an acceleration of amounts due under the respective facilities or a requirement to post additional collateral in the event of a downgrade of our credit ratings 
corporate credit facility our billion syndicated revolving bank credit facility is used for general corporate purposes 
borrowings under the facility are secured by natural gas and oil proved reserves and bear interest at our option at either i the greater of the reference rate of union bank  na or the federal funds effective rate plus  both of which are subject to a margin that varies from to per annum according to our senior unsecured long term debt ratings  or ii the eurodollar rate  which is based on the london interbank offered rate libor  plus a margin that varies from to per annum according to our senior unsecured long term debt ratings 
the collateral value and borrowing base are determined periodically 
the unused portion of the facility is subject to a commitment fee of per annum

hedging facility we have a multi counterparty secured hedging facility with counterparties that have committed to provide approximately tcfe of hedging capacity for commodity price derivatives and tcfe for basis derivatives with an aggregate mark to market capacity of billion under the terms of the facility 
as of december   we had hedged under the facility tcfe of our future production with price derivatives and tcfe with basis derivatives 
the multi counterparty facility allows us to enter into cash settled natural gas  oil and natural gas liquids price and basis derivative instruments with the counterparties 
our obligations under the multi counterparty facility are secured by proved reserves  the value of which must cover the fair value of the transactions outstanding under the facility by at least times  and guarantees by certain subsidiaries that also guarantee our corporate revolving bank credit facility and indentures 
the counterparties obligations under the facility must be secured by cash or short term us treasury instruments to the extent that any mark to market amounts they owe to chesapeake exceed defined thresholds 
the maximum volume based trading capacity under the facility is governed by the expected production of the pledged reserve collateral  and volume based trading limits are applied separately to price and basis derivative instruments 
in addition  there are volume based sub limits for natural gas  oil and natural gas liquids derivative instruments 
chesapeake has significant flexibility with regard to releases and or substitutions of pledged reserves  provided that certain collateral coverage and other requirements are met 
the facility does not have a maturity date

hedging activities natural gas and oil derivatives our results of operations and cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for natural gas and oil 
to mitigate a portion of the exposure to adverse market changes  we have entered into various derivative instruments 
executive management is involved in all risk management activities and the board of directors reviews the company s hedging program at its quarterly board meetings 
we believe we have sufficient internal controls to prevent unauthorized hedging 
as of december   our natural gas and oil derivative instruments were comprised of swaps  call options  swaptions  knockout swaps and basis protection swaps 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk contains a description of each of these instruments and realized and unrealized gains and losses on natural gas and oil derivatives during  and although derivatives often fail to achieve effectiveness for accounting purposes  we believe our derivative instruments continue to be highly effective in achieving our risk management objectives 

table of contents hedging allows us to predict with greater certainty the effective prices we will receive for our hedged production

production for the barnett shale for the years ended  and was bcfe  bcfe and bcfe  respectively 
our barnett shale production is concentrated in urban areas where the cost to develop the necessary infrastructure to gather and deliver the natural gas to intrastate pipelines significantly exceeds the cost of similar infrastructure in non urban areas 
additionally  the rapid development of the barnett shale required the construction of new pipelines to provide an adequate market for these new gas reserves 
in order to support the timely construction of these new pipelines  we 
table of contents entered into firm transportation contracts that obligate the company to pay demand fees even if we do not deliver specified volumes of natural gas into certain gathering systems and intrastate pipelines 
the demand fees associated with unused capacity and the other gathering and transportation fees described above have resulted in lower natural gas price realizations in the barnett shale

we account for our natural gas and oil properties using the full cost method of accounting  which limits the amount of costs we can capitalize and requires us to write off these costs if the carrying value of natural gas and oil assets in the evaluated portion of our full cost pool exceeds the sum of the present value of expected future net cash flows of proved reserves using a pre tax discount rate based on pricing and cost assumptions prescribed by the sec and the present value of certain natural gas and oil derivative instruments 
restructuring costs 
in  we recorded million of restructuring and relocation costs related to our eastern division and certain other workforce reduction costs 
we reorganized our charleston  
table of contents west virginia based eastern division from a regional corporate headquarters to a regional field office consistent with the business model we use elsewhere in the country 
as a result  we consolidated the management of our eastern division land  legal  accounting  information technology  geoscience and engineering departments into our corporate offices in oklahoma city 
the costs of the restructuring included termination benefits  consolidating or closing facilities and relocating employees 
the discussion of restructuring costs in note of our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report provides additional detail on the accounting for and reporting of these costs 
interest expense 
interest expense was million in compared to million in and million in as follows years ended december  in millions interest expense on senior notes interest expense on credit facilities realized gains losses on interest rate derivatives unrealized gains losses on interest rate derivatives amortization of loan discount and other capitalized interest total interest expense average long term borrowings interest expense  excluding unrealized gains losses on interest rate derivatives and net of amounts capitalized  was per mcfe in  per mcfe in and per mcfe in the decrease in interest expense per mcfe in and is due to increased production volumes  a decrease in the aggregate principal amount of our senior notes outstanding and an increase in capitalized interest 
capitalized interest increased in and as a result of a significant increase in unevaluated properties  the base on which interest is capitalized 
earnings losses on investments 
earnings losses on investments was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the earnings related to our equity in the net income of certain investments  primarily chkm and fts international  llc fts 
the earnings consisted of million related to our equity in the net income of certain investments and million related to the initial public offering by chkm and a private offering of common stock by chaparral energy  inc  which represented our proportionate share of the excess of offering proceeds over our carrying value 
the loss related to our equity in the net losses of certain investments 
losses on purchases or exchanges of debt 
during  we completed tender offers to purchase billion in aggregate principal amount of certain of our senior notes and million in aggregate principal amount of certain of our contingent convertible senior notes 
associated with the tender offers we recorded losses of approximately million related to the senior notes and million related to the contingent convertible senior notes 
also during  we purchased million in aggregate principal amount of our contingent convertible senior notes due for approximately million 
associated with these purchases  we recognized a loss of million in during  we redeemed in whole for an aggregate redemption price of approximately billion  approximately million in principal amount of our outstanding senior notes due  million in principal amount of our senior notes due and approximately 
table of contents million in principal amount of our senior notes due associated with the redemptions  we recognized a loss of million in also during  we redeemed in whole for a redemption price of approximately million  plus accrued interest  all million in principal amount of our senior notes due we recognized a loss of million in associated with the redemptions 
additionally during  we completed tender offers to purchase for cash million of senior notes due  million of senior notes due and million of senior notes due following the completion of these tender offers  we redeemed the remaining million of senior notes due  million of senior notes due and million of senior notes due based on the redemption provisions in the indentures 
associated with these tender offers and redemptions  we recognized a loss of million in finally  in  we privately exchanged approximately million in aggregate principal amount of our contingent convertible senior notes due for an aggregate of  shares of our common stock valued at approximately million 
through these transactions  we were able to retire this debt for common stock valued at approximately of the face value of the notes 
of the million principal amount of convertible notes exchanged in  million was allocated to the debt component of the notes and the remaining million was allocated to the equity conversion feature of the notes and was recorded as an adjustment to paid in capital 
the difference between the debt component and value of the common stock exchanged in these transactions resulted in a million loss including a nominal amount of deferred charges associated with the exchanges

impairment of investments 
we recorded million and million of impairments of certain investments in and  respectively 
each of our investees was impacted by the dramatic slowing of the worldwide economy and the credit markets in and the economic weakness resulted in significantly reduced natural gas and oil prices which led to a meaningful decline in the overall level of activity in the markets served by our investees 
associated with the weakness in performance of certain of the investees  as well as an evaluation of their financial condition and near term prospects  we recognized that an other than temporary impairment had occurred on certain investments

income tax expense benefit 
chesapeake recorded income tax expense of billion in compared to income tax expense of billion in and an income tax benefit of billion in of the billion in income tax expense recorded in  billion is deferred 
of the million increase in  million was the result of an increase in the effective tax rate 
table of contents which was offset by a million decrease as a result of the decrease in net income before income taxes 
our effective income tax rate was in compared to in and in our effective tax rate fluctuates as a result of the impact of state income taxes and permanent differences 
we expect our effective income tax rate to be in application of critical accounting policies readers of this report and users of the information contained in it should be aware that certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place 
the four policies we consider to be the most significant are discussed below 
the company s management has discussed each critical accounting policy with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
the selection and application of accounting policies are an important process that changes as our business changes and as accounting rules are developed 
accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives  but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules and the use of judgment to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business 
derivatives 
chesapeake uses commodity price and financial risk management instruments to mitigate a portion of our exposure to price fluctuations in natural gas and oil prices  changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
recognized gains and losses on derivative contracts are reported as a component of the related transaction 
results of commodity derivative contracts are reflected in natural gas and oil sales  and results of interest rate and foreign exchange rate hedging contracts are reflected in interest expense 
the changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not qualifying  or not elected for designation as either cash flow or fair value hedges that occur prior to maturity are reported currently in the consolidated statement of operations as unrealized gains losses within natural gas and oil sales or interest expense 
cash settlements of our derivative arrangements are generally classified as operating cash flows unless the derivative is deemed to contain  for accounting purposes  a significant financing element at contract inception  in which case these cash settlements are classified as financing cash flows in the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows 
accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded at fair value and included in the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation  which is established at the inception of a derivative 
for derivative instruments designated as natural gas and oil cash flow hedges  changes in fair value  to the extent the hedge is effective  are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings as natural gas and oil sales 
any change in the fair value resulting from ineffectiveness is recognized immediately in natural gas and oil sales 
for interest rate derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges  changes in fair value  as well as the offsetting changes in the estimated fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk  are recognized currently in earnings as interest expense 
differences between the changes in the fair values of the hedged item and the derivative instrument  if any  represent gains or losses on ineffectiveness and are reflected currently in interest expense 
hedge effectiveness is measured at least quarterly based on the relative changes in fair value between the derivative contract and the hedged item over time 
changes in fair value of contracts that do not qualify as hedges or are not designated as hedges are also recognized currently in earnings 
see hedging activities above and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information regarding our hedging activities 
one of the primary factors that can have an impact on our results of operations is the method used to value our derivatives 
we have established the fair value of our derivative instruments utilizing established index prices  volatility curves and discount factors 
these estimates are compared to our 
table of contents counterparty values for reasonableness 
derivative transactions are also subject to the risk that counterparties will be unable to meet their obligations 
such non performance risk is considered in the valuation of our derivative instruments  but to date has not had a material impact on the values of our derivatives 
the values we report in our financial statements are as of a point in time and subsequently change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions and other factors 
additionally  in accordance with accounting guidance for derivatives and hedging  to the extent that a legal right of set off exists  chesapeake nets the value of its derivative instruments with the same counterparty in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
another factor that can impact our results of operations each period is our ability to estimate the level of correlation between future changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments and the transactions being hedged  both at inception and on an ongoing basis 
this correlation is complicated since energy commodity prices  the primary risk we hedge  have quality and location differences that can be difficult to hedge effectively 
the factors underlying our estimates of fair value and our assessment of correlation of our derivative instruments are impacted by actual results and changes in conditions that affect these factors  many of which are beyond our control 
due to the volatility of natural gas and oil prices and  to a lesser extent  interest rates and foreign exchange rates  the company s financial condition and results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments 
as of december   and  the fair value of our derivatives were liabilities of billion  million and million  respectively 
variable interest entities 
an entity is referred to as a vie pursuant to accounting guidance for consolidation if it possesses one of the following criteria i it is thinly capitalized  ii the residual equity holders do not control the entity  iii the equity holders are shielded from the economic losses  iv the equity holders do not participate fully in the entity s residual economics  or v the entity was established with non substantive voting interests 
we consolidate a vie when we have both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the activities of the vie and the right to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could be potentially significant to the vie 
along with the vies that are consolidated in accordance with these guidelines  we also hold variable interests in other vies that are not consolidated because we are not the primary beneficiary 
we continually monitor both consolidated and unconsolidated vies to determine if any events have occurred that could cause the primary beneficiary to change 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report for further discussion of vies 
natural gas and oil properties 
the accounting for our business is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the natural gas and oil industry 
there are two allowable methods of accounting for natural gas and oil business activities the successful efforts method and the full cost method 
chesapeake follows the full cost method of accounting under which all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration and development activities are capitalized 
we also capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition  exploration and development activities and do not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
under the successful efforts method  geological and geophysical costs and costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are charged to expense as incurred 
costs of drilling exploratory wells that do not result in proved reserves are charged to expense 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment of natural gas and oil properties are generally calculated on a well by well or lease or field basis versus the aggregated full cost pool basis 
additionally  gain or loss is generally recognized on all sales of natural gas and oil properties under the successful efforts method 
as a result  our financial statements will differ from those of companies that apply the successful efforts method since we will generally reflect a higher level of capitalized costs as well as a higher natural gas and oil depreciation  depletion and amortization rate  and we will not have exploration expenses that successful efforts companies frequently have 

table of contents under the full cost method  capitalized costs are amortized on a composite unit of production method based on proved natural gas and oil reserves 
if we maintain the same level of production year over year  the depreciation  depletion and amortization expense may be significantly different if our estimate of remaining reserves or future development costs changes significantly 
proceeds from the sale of properties are accounted for as reductions of capitalized costs unless such sales involve a significant change in proved reserves and significantly alter the relationship between costs and proved reserves  in which case a gain or loss is recognized 
the costs of unproved properties are excluded from amortization until the properties are evaluated 
we review all of our unevaluated properties quarterly to determine whether or not and to what extent proved reserves have been assigned to the properties  and otherwise if impairment has occurred 
unevaluated properties are grouped by major producing area where individual property costs are not significant and are assessed individually when individual costs are significant 
we review the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties under the full cost accounting rules of the securities and exchange commission on a quarterly basis 
this quarterly review is referred to as a ceiling test 
under the ceiling test  capitalized costs  less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes  may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the present value of estimated future net revenues adjusted for cash flow hedges less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves  less any related income tax effects 
in calculating estimated future net revenues  current prices are calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of natural gas and oil prices on the first day of each month within the month period prior to the ending date of the quarterly period 
costs used are those as of the end of the appropriate quarterly period 
such prices are utilized except where different prices are fixed and determinable from applicable contracts for the remaining term of those contracts  including the effects of derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges 
two primary factors impacting this test are reserve levels and natural gas and oil prices  and their associated impact on the present value of estimated future net revenues 
revisions to estimates of natural gas and oil reserves and or an increase or decrease in prices can have a material impact on the present value of estimated future net revenues 
any excess of the net book value  less deferred income taxes  is generally written off as an expense 
see natural gas and oil properties in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report for further information on the full cost method of accounting 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate the federal and state income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which chesapeake operates 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as derivative instruments  depreciation  depletion and amortization  and certain accrued liabilities for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences and our net operating loss carryforwards result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess  using all available positive and negative evidence  the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
if we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
generally  to the extent chesapeake establishes a valuation allowance or increases or decreases this allowance in a period  we must include an expense or reduction of expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
under accounting guidance for income taxes  an enterprise must use judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence 
the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence should be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
the more negative evidence that exists i the more positive evidence is necessary and ii the more 
table of contents difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for some portion or all of the deferred tax asset 
among the more significant types of evidence that we consider are taxable income projections in future years  whether the carryforward period is so brief that it would limit realization of the tax benefit  future sales and operating cost projections that will produce more than enough taxable income to realize the deferred tax asset based on existing sales prices and cost structures  and our earnings history exclusive of the loss that created the future deductible amount coupled with evidence indicating that the loss is an aberration rather than a continuing condition 
if i natural gas and oil prices were to decrease significantly below present levels and if such decreases were considered other than temporary  ii exploration  drilling and operating costs were to increase significantly beyond current levels  or iii we were confronted with any other significantly negative evidence pertaining to our ability to realize our nol carryforwards prior to their expiration  we may be required to provide a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had deferred tax assets of billion 
accounting guidance for recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions prescribes a threshold condition that a tax position must meet for any of the benefit of the uncertain tax position to be recognized in the financial statements 
guidance is also provided regarding de recognition  classification and disclosure of these uncertain tax positions 
based on this guidance  we regularly analyze tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return based on the threshold condition prescribed 
tax positions that do not meet or exceed this threshold condition are considered uncertain tax positions 
we accrue interest related to these uncertain tax positions which is recognized in interest expense 
penalties  if any  related to uncertain tax positions would be recorded in other expenses 
additional information about uncertain tax positions appears in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
disclosures about effects of transactions with related parties chief executive officer as of december  and  we had accrued accounts receivable from our chief executive officer  aubrey k 
mcclendon  of million and million  respectively  representing joint interest billings from december and these amounts were invoiced and timely paid in the following month 
since chesapeake was founded in  mr 
mcclendon has acquired working interests in virtually all of our natural gas and oil properties by participating in our drilling activities under the terms of the founder well participation program fwpp and predecessor participation arrangements provided for in mr 
mcclendon s employment agreements 
under the fwpp  approved by our shareholders in june  mr 
mcclendon may elect to participate in all or none of the wells drilled by or on behalf of chesapeake during a calendar year  but he is not allowed to participate only in selected wells 
a participation election is required to be received by the compensation committee of chesapeake s board of directors not less than days prior to the start of each calendar year 
his participation is permitted only under the terms outlined in the fwpp  which  among other things  limits his individual participation to a maximum working interest of in a well and prohibits participation in situations where chesapeake s working interest would be reduced below as a result of his participation 
in addition  the company is reimbursed for costs associated with leasehold acquired by mr 
mcclendon as a result of his well participation 
from time to time  mr 
mcclendon has sold his 
table of contents fwpp interests in conjunction with sales by the company of its interests in the same properties  and the proceeds related to those sales have been allocated between mr 
mcclendon and the company based on their respective ownership interests and on the same terms as those that applied to the company s properties included in the sale 
on december   we entered into a new five year employment agreement with mr 
mcclendon that contained a one time well cost incentive award to him 
the total cost of the award to chesapeake was million plus employment taxes in the amount of approximately million 
the incentive award is subject to a clawback equal to any unvested portion of the award if during the initial five year term of the employment agreement  mr 
mcclendon resigns from the company or is terminated for cause by the company 
we are recognizing the incentive award as general and administrative expense over the five year vesting period for the clawback resulting in an expense of approximately million per year beginning in the net incentive award after deduction of applicable withholding and employment taxes of approximately million was fully applied against costs attributable to interests in company wells acquired by mr 
mcclendon or his affiliates under the fwpp 
in  chesapeake entered into a license and naming rights agreement with the professional basketball club  llc pbc for the arena in downtown oklahoma city 
the pbc is the owner of the oklahoma city thunder basketball team  a national basketball association franchise and the arena s primary tenant 
mr 
mcclendon has a equity interest in pbc 
under the terms of the agreement  chesapeake has committed to pay fees ranging from million to million per year through for the arena naming rights and other associated benefits 
the naming rights provide chesapeake with an enhanced public awareness and recognition both locally and nationally 
since  chesapeake has been a founding sponsor of the oklahoma city thunder under successive one year contracts 
in  it entered into a year sponsorship agreement  committing to pay an average annual fee of million for advertising  use of an arena suite and other benefits 
in  the company also agreed to purchase oklahoma city thunder game tickets for the regular season home games for approximately million and committed to purchase tickets for any home playoff games 
pursuant to a court approved litigation settlement with certain plaintiff shareholders under litigation in item of this report  the sale of an antique map collection that occurred in december between mr 
mcclendon and the company will be rescinded 
mr 
mcclendon will pay the company approximately million plus interest  and the company will reconvey the map collection to mr 
mcclendon 
the transaction is scheduled to be completed not later than days after entry of a final non appealable judgment

recently issued accounting standards the financial accounting standards board fasb recently issued the following standards which we reviewed to determine the potential impact on our financial statements upon adoption 
in december  the fasb issued guidance on disclosure of information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of a company s financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position 
the standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january  this guidance will not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued guidance related to the annual goodwill impairment test 
the guidance provides entities with the option of performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether the two step goodwill impairment test is necessary 
the revised standard is effective for goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect this guidance to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations as it is a change in application of the goodwill impairment test only 
in june  the fasb issued guidance on comprehensive income  which provides two options for presenting items of net income  comprehensive income and total comprehensive income  by either 
table of contents creating one continuous statement of comprehensive income or two separate consecutive statements

in december  the fasb deferred the effective date of certain presentation requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
this guidance will not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued guidance which provides a consistent definition of fair value and common requirements for measurement of and disclosure about fair value under gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
this new guidance changes some fair value measurement principles and disclosure requirements 
we will have additional disclosures around our level financial instruments that are reported at fair value  and we will categorize the level of the fair value hierarchy for items that are not measured at fair value in the statement of financial position but for which the fair value is required to be disclosed 
this guidance is effective january  the guidance will not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in  the fasb issued guidance requiring additional disclosures for the reconciliation of purchases  sales  issuance and settlements of financial instruments valued with a level method effective beginning on january  we adopted this guidance in adoption had no impact on our financial position or results of operations

forward looking statements this report includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of as amended the exchange act 
forward looking statements are statements other than historical fact and give our current expectations or forecasts of future events 
they include estimates of natural gas and oil reserves  expected natural gas and oil production and future expenses  assumptions regarding future natural gas and oil prices  planned drilling activity and drilling and completion capital expenditures  and anticipated asset monetizations  as well as statements concerning anticipated cash flow and liquidity  business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations 
disclosures concerning the fair values of derivative contracts and their estimated contribution to our future results of operations are based upon market information as of a specific date 
these market prices are subject to significant volatility 
although we believe the expectations and forecasts reflected in these and other forward looking statements are reasonable  we can give no assurance they will prove to have been correct 
they can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results are described under risk factors in item a of this report and include the volatility of natural gas and oil prices  the limitations our level of indebtedness may have on our financial flexibility  declines in the values of our natural gas and oil properties resulting in ceiling test write downs  the availability of capital on an economic basis  including planned asset monetization transactions  to fund reserve replacement costs  our ability to fund capital expenditures  replace reserves and sustain production  uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of natural gas and oil reserves and projecting future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures

we urge you to carefully review and consider the disclosures made in this report and our other filings with the securities and exchange commission sec that attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk natural gas and oil derivatives our results of operations and cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for natural gas and oil 
to mitigate a portion of the exposure to adverse market changes  we have entered into various derivative instruments 
these instruments allow us to predict with greater certainty the effective natural gas and oil prices to be received for our hedged production 
we believe our derivative instruments continue to be highly effective in achieving our risk management objectives 
our general strategy for attempting to mitigate exposure to adverse natural gas and oil price changes is to hedge into strengthening natural gas and oil futures markets when prices allow us to generate higher cash margins and when we view prices to be in the upper range of our predicted future price range 
information we consider in forming an opinion about future prices includes general economic conditions  industrial output levels and expectations  producer breakeven cost structures  liquefied natural gas trends  natural gas and oil storage inventory levels  industry decline rates for base production and weather trends 
we use a wide range of derivative instruments to achieve our risk management objectives  including swaps and options calls and swaptions 
all of these are described in more detail below 
we typically use swaps for a large portion of the natural gas and oil volume we hedge 
swaps are used when the price level is acceptable 
we also sell calls  taking advantage of market volatility for a portion of our projected production volumes 
we do this when we would be satisfied to sell our production at the price being capped by the call strike price or believe it would be more likely than not that the future natural gas or oil price will stay below the call strike price plus the premium we will receive 
in the second half of  we bought natural gas calls to  in effect  lock in sold call positions 
due to the low natural gas prices  we were able to achieve this at a low cost to us 
we deferred the payment of the premium on these trades to the related month of production being hedged 
at times  we have taken advantage of attractive strip prices in out years and sold natural gas and oil call options to our counterparties in 
table of contents exchange for near term natural gas swaps with fixed prices above the then current market price 
this effectively allows us to sell out year volatility through call options at terms acceptable to us in exchange for natural gas swaps with fixed prices in excess of the market price for natural gas at that time 
in the fourth quarter of  we entered into oil swaps that can be extended at the option of the counterparty 
this allows us to receive a higher fixed price on these swaps than what the market would have offered without such an option 
some of our derivatives are deemed to contain  for accounting purposes  a significant financing element at contract inception and the cash settlements associated with these instruments are classified as financing cash flows in the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows 
we determine the volume we may potentially hedge by reviewing our estimated future production levels  which are derived from extensive examination of existing producing reserve estimates and estimates of likely production risked from new drilling 
production forecasts are updated at least monthly and adjusted if necessary to actual results and activity levels 
we do not hedge more volumes than we expect to produce  and if production estimates are lowered for future periods and derivative instruments are already executed for some volume above the new production forecasts  the positions are reversed 
the actual fixed price on our derivative instruments is derived from bidding and the reference nymex price  as reflected in current nymex trading 
the pricing dates of our derivative contracts follow nymex futures 
all of our derivative instruments are net settled based on the difference between the fixed price as stated in the contract and the floating price payment  resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty 
we adjust our derivative positions in response to changes in prices and market conditions as part of an ongoing dynamic process 
we review our derivative positions continuously and if future market conditions change and prices are at levels we believe could jeopardize the effectiveness of a position  we will mitigate such risk by either doing a cash settlement with our counterparty  restructuring the position  or by entering into a new trade that effectively reverses the current position 
the factors we consider in closing or restructuring a position before the settlement date are identical to those we reviewed when deciding to enter into the original derivative position 
gains or losses related to closed positions will be realized in the month of related production based on the terms specified in the original contract 
we have determined the fair value of our derivative instruments utilizing established index prices  volatility curves and discount factors 
these estimates are compared to our counterparty values for reasonableness 
derivative transactions are also subject to the risk that counterparties will be unable to meet their obligations 
such non performance risk is considered in the valuation of our derivative instruments  but to date has not had a material impact on the values of our derivatives 
future risk related to counterparties not being able to meet their obligations has been partially mitigated under our secured hedging facility which requires counterparties to post collateral if their obligations to chesapeake are in excess of defined thresholds 
the values we report in our financial statements are as of a point in time and subsequently change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions and other factors 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report for further discussion of the fair value measurements associated with our derivatives 
as of december   our natural gas and oil derivative instruments consisted of the following swaps chesapeake receives a fixed price and pays a floating market price to the counterparty for the hedged commodity 
call options chesapeake sells and  occasionally buys  call options in exchange for a premium 
at the time of settlement  if the market price exceeds the fixed price of the call 
table of contents option  chesapeake pays the counterparty such excess on sold call options  and chesapeake receives such excess on bought call options 
if the market price settles below the fixed price of the call options  no payment is due from either party 
swaptions chesapeake sells swaptions to counterparties that allow them  on a specific date  to extend an existing fixed price swap for a certain period of time 
knockout swaps chesapeake receives a fixed price and pays a floating market price 
the fixed price received by chesapeake includes a premium in exchange for the possibility to reduce the counterparty s exposure to zero  in any given month  if the floating market price is lower than a certain pre determined knockout price 
basis protection swaps these instruments are arrangements that guarantee a price differential to nymex for natural gas from a specified delivery point 
our basis protection swaps typically have negative differentials to nymex

pursuant to accounting guidance for derivatives and hedging  certain derivatives qualify for designation as cash flow hedges 
following these provisions  changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  to the extent they are effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk  are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings as the physical transactions being hedged occur 
any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness is currently recognized in natural gas and oil sales as unrealized gains losses 
realized gains losses consist of settled contracts related to the production periods being reported 
unrealized gains losses consist of both temporary fluctuations in the mark to market values of non qualifying contracts and settled values of non qualifying derivatives related to future production periods

changes in interest rates affect the amount of interest we earn on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and the interest rate we pay on borrowings under our revolving bank credit facilities 
all of our other long term indebtedness is fixed rate and  therefore  does not expose us to the risk of fluctuations in earnings or cash flow due to changes in market interest rates 
however  changes in interest rates do affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt 
interest rate derivatives to mitigate a portion of our exposure to volatility in interest rates related to our senior notes and credit facilities  we enter into interest rate derivatives 
as of december   our interest rate derivative instruments consisted of the following types of instruments swaps chesapeake enters into fixed to floating interest rate swaps we receive a fixed interest rate and pay a floating market rate to mitigate our exposure to changes in the fair value of our senior notes 
we enter into floating to fixed interest rate swaps we receive a floating market rate and a pay fixed interest rate to manage our interest rate exposure related to our bank credit facility borrowings 
swaptions occasionally we sell an option to a counterparty for a premium which allows the counterparty to enter into a swap with us on a specific date

in addition to open derivative positions disclosed above  at december  we had million of net hedging gains related to settled contracts that will be recorded within interest expense as realized gains losses as they are transferred from either our senior note liability or unrealized interest expense gains losses over the next nine year term of the related senior notes 
in conjunction with our may tender offers  we transferred million of the gain to loss on redemption of debt

in may  we purchased and subsequently retired million in aggregate principal amount of these senior notes following a tender offer  and we simultaneously unwound the cross currency swaps for the same principal amount 
as a result  we reclassified a loss of million from accumulated other comprehensive income to the consolidated statement of operations  million of which related to the unwound notional amount and was included in losses on purchases or exchanges of debt  and million of which related to future interest associated with the unwound principal and was included in interest expense
