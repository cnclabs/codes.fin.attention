overview the semiconductor capital equipment industry is subject to significant cyclical swings in capital spending by semiconductor manufacturers 
capital spending is influenced by demand for semiconductors and the products using them  the utilization rate and capacity of existing semiconductor manufacturing facilities and changes in semiconductor technology  all of which are outside of our control 
as a result  our revenue and gross margins fluctuate from year to year and period to period 
we typically become more efficient in manufacturing products as they mature 
our expense base is largely fixed and does not vary significantly with changes in volume 
therefore  we experience fluctuations in operating results and cash flows depending on our revenue as driven by the level of capital expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers 
the sizable expense of building  upgrading or expanding a semiconductor fabrication facility is increasingly causing semiconductor companies to contract with foundries to manufacture their semiconductors 
in addition  consolidation and partnering within the semiconductor manufacturing industry is increasing 
we expect these trends to continue to reduce the number of our potential customers 
this growing concentration of axcelis customers may increase pricing pressure as higher percentages of our total revenue are tied to the buying decisions of a particular customer or a small number of customers 
axcelis net revenue from its ten largest customers accounted for of total revenue for the year ended december  compared to   and of revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
after historic lows in  the market for our products steadily improved during and we gained market share with our single wafer ion implant systems for high current and high energy applications the optima hdx and optima xex 
this market recovery continued during the first half of  but during the second half of  deterioration within the industry environment decreased our revenues as compared with the first half of the year 
in addition  we had delays in key penetrations in the second half of these delays were a function of poor market conditions and issues in our prioritization of new technology 
however  in we continued to penetrate new customers with our optima implant products which we expect will lead to additional future sales 
in we also gained market share with our integra dry strip products 
we expect the industry to recover in  and as a result  we believe that our financial results will improve 
in the event that industry conditions cause the demand for axcelis products to decline in future periods  we believe that we can align manufacturing and operating expense levels to changing business conditions and provide sufficient liquidity to support operations 
operating results for the years presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for future interim periods or years as a whole 
critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon axcelis consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
management s estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for additional accounting policies see notes to consolidated financial statements note significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy involves significant judgment by management 
as described below  we consider a broad array of facts and circumstances in determining when to recognize revenue  including contractual future service obligations to the customer  the complexity of the customer s post delivery acceptance provisions  payment history  customer creditworthiness and the installation process 
in the future  if the post delivery acceptance provisions and installation process become more complex or result in a materially lower rate of acceptance  we may have to revise our revenue recognition policy  which could delay the timing of revenue recognition 
axcelis system sales transactions are made up of multiple elements  including the system itself and elements that are not delivered simultaneously with the system 
these undelivered elements might include a combination of installation services  extended warranty and support and spare parts  all of which are generally covered by a single sales price 
effective january   we adopted accounting standards update  or asu  no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  as required  using the prospective method 
accordingly  this guidance is being applied to all system revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after january  the adoption of the amended guidance did not change the accounting for arrangements entered into prior to january  there was no material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows upon adoption and we do not expect adoption will have a material impact on our future reporting periods based on our current practices 
the impact of adopting this amended guidance on our results of operations has been limited to transactions involving the sale of systems 
asu no 
amended the previous guidance for multiple element arrangements 
pursuant to the amended guidance in asu  our system revenue arrangements with multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if specified criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer 
if the criteria are met  then the consideration received is allocated among the separate units based on their relative selling price  and the revenue is recognized separately for each of the separate units 
we determine selling price for each unit of accounting element using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe or third party evidence tpe  if they exist  otherwise  we use best estimated selling price besp 
the company generally expects that it will not be able to establish tpe due to the nature of its products  and  as such  the company typically will determine selling price using vsoe or besp 
where required  the company determines besp for an individual element based on consideration of both market and company specific factors  including the selling price and profit margin for similar products  the cost to produce the deliverable and the anticipated margin on that deliverable and the characteristics of the varying markets in which the deliverable is sold 
the total consideration to be received in the transaction is allocated to each element in the arrangement based upon the relative selling price of each element when compared to the consideration received 
systems are not sold separately and vsoe or tpe is not available for the systems element 
therefore the selling price associated with systems is based on besp 
the allocated value for installation in the arrangement includes a the greater of i the relative selling price of the installation or ii the portion or the sales price that will not be received until the installation is completed the retention 
the selling price of installation is based upon the fair value of the service performed  including labor  which is based upon the estimated time to complete the installation at hourly rates  and material components  both of which are sold separately 
the selling price of all other elements extended warranty for support  spare parts  and labor is based upon the price charged when these elements are sold separately  or vsoe 
product revenue for products which have demonstrated market acceptance  is generally recognized upon shipment provided title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  evidence of an arrangement exists  prices are contractually fixed or determinable  collection is reasonably assured through historical collection results and regular credit evaluations  and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 
revenue from installation services is recognized at the time formal acceptance is received from the customer or  for certain customers  when both the formal acceptance and retention payment have been received 
revenue for other elements is recognized at the time products are shipped or the related services are performed 
we generally recognize product revenue for systems which have demonstrated market acceptance at the time of shipment because the customer s post delivery acceptance provisions and installation process have been established to be routine  commercially inconsequential and perfunctory 
while some customers accept axcelis standard specifications  the majority of axcelis systems are designed and tailored to meet the customer s specifications  as outlined in the contract between the customer and axcelis 
to ensure that the customer s specifications are satisfied  many customers request that new systems be tested at axcelis facilities prior to shipment  normally with the customer present  under conditions that substantially replicate the customer s production environment and the customer s criteria are confirmed to have been met 
we believe the risk of failure to complete a system installation is remote 
should an installation not be completed successfully  the contractual provisions do not provide for forfeiture  refund or other purchase price concession beyond those prescribed by the provisions of the uniform commercial code applicable generally to such transactions 
for initial shipments of systems with new technologies or in the small number of instances where axcelis is unsure of meeting the customer s specifications or obtaining customer acceptance upon shipment of the system  axcelis will defer the recognition of systems revenue and related costs until written customer acceptance of the system is obtained 
this deferral period is generally within twelve months of shipment 
revenue related to maintenance and service contracts is recognized ratably over the duration of the contracts  or based on parts usage  where appropriate 
revenue related to service hours is recognized when the services are performed 
royalty revenue was primarily earned under the terms of our license agreement with sen 
royalty revenue was recorded at the time sen notified axcelis that royalties had been earned 
impairment of long lived assets we record impairment losses on long lived assets when events and circumstances indicate that these assets might not be recoverable 
recoverability is measured by a comparison of the assets carrying amount to their expected future undiscounted net cash flows 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment is measured based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value 
future actual performance could be materially different from our current forecasts  which could impact future estimates of undiscounted cash flows and may result in the impairment of the carrying amount of the long lived assets in the future 
this could be caused by strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on our customer base  or a material adverse change in our relationships with significant customers 
as of december  the company completed a test for recoverability due to indicators that were present at december  results of this test indicated no impairment as of december  the company did not record an impairment charge for the years ended december    or accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts we record an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is established based on a specific assessment of collectibility of our customer accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be necessary 
inventory allowance for excess and obsolescence we record an allowance for estimated excess and obsolete inventory 
the allowance is determined using management s assumptions of materials usage  based on estimates of forecasted and historical demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions become less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts or product demand and pricing assumptions  any significant unanticipated changes in demand  pricing  or technical developments would significantly impact the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
in the future  if we find that estimates are too optimistic and determine that inventory needs to be written down  the company will recognize such costs in our cost of revenue at the time of such determination 
conversely  if we find our estimates are too pessimistic and we subsequently sell product that has previously been written down  our gross margin in that period will be favorably impacted 
product warranty we generally offer a one year warranty for all of our systems  the terms and conditions of which vary depending upon the product sold 
for all systems sold  we accrue a liability for the estimated cost of standard warranty at the time of system shipment and defer the portion of systems revenue attributable to the fair value of non standard warranty 
costs for non standard warranty are expensed as incurred 
factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of installed units  historical and anticipated product failure rates  material usage and service labor costs 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded liability and adjust the amount as necessary 
results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated years ended december  revenue product service royalties  primarily from sen total revenue cost of revenue product services total cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative restructuring charges total operating expenses income loss from operations other income expense gain on sale of sen equity loss of sen interest income interest expense other  net total other income expense income loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss year ended december  in comparison to the year ended december  revenue revenue increased significantly in compared to as the company benefited from improving market conditions and increased capacity utilization at customers manufacturing facilities during the first half of however during the second half of  deterioration within the industry environment resulted in a decrease in our revenues as compared to the first half of the year 
product product revenue  which includes systems sales  sales of spare parts and product upgrades  was million or of revenue in  compared with million  or of revenue in the increase in product revenue in is attributable to the strengthening of the semiconductor market and a related increase in capital spending by semiconductor manufacturers during the first half of however  our revenues decreased during the second half of due to the weakening of the semiconductor market and the related delay in capital spending by semiconductor manufacturers 
in addition  we had delays in key penetrations in the second half of these delays were a function of poor market conditions and issues in our prioritization of new technology 
despite this market slowdown we believe we are gaining market traction with our single wafer ion implant systems 
during  we also gained market share with our integra dry strip products 
approximately of systems revenue in was from sales of mm products and was from sales of mm products  compared with and for sales of mm products and mm products in  respectively 
a portion of our revenue from system sales is deferred until installation and other services related to future deliverables are performed 
the total amount of deferred revenue at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the decrease was mainly due to the decrease in systems sales in the second half of and the timing of acceptance of deferred system sales 
service service revenue  which includes the labor component of maintenance and service contracts and fees for service hours provided by on site service personnel  was million  or of revenue for  compared with million  or of revenue  for although service revenue should increase with the expansion of the installed base of systems  it can fluctuate from period to period based on capacity utilization at customers manufacturing facilities  which affects the need for equipment service 
the slight decrease during was primarily due to a decrease in fabrication utilization in the semiconductor industry particularly during the second half of revenue categories used by management as an alternative to the line item revenue categories discussed above  management also uses revenue categorizations which look at revenue by product line the most significant of which is ion implant and by aftermarket  as described below 
ion implant included in total revenue of million in is revenue from sales of ion implantation products and related service of million  or of total revenue  compared with million  or  of total revenue in the dollar increase was due to the factors discussed above for product revenue 
annual revenue from the sale of ion implantation products and service typically averages from to of total revenue 
aftermarket the company s product revenue includes sales of spare parts and product upgrades as well as complete systems 
we refer to the business of selling spare parts and product upgrades  combined with the sale of maintenance labor and service contracts and service hours  as the aftermarket business 
included in total revenue of million in is revenue from our aftermarket business of million  compared to million for aftermarket revenue generally increases with expansion of the installed base of systems but can fluctuate from period to period based on capacity utilization at customers manufacturing facilities which affects the sale of spare parts and demand for equipment service 
gross profit product gross profit from product revenue was for the twelve months ended december   compared to for the twelve months ended december  the increase in gross profit of percentage points is due primarily to a favorable mix of products at higher margins and leveraging our on going efforts to drive labor and material productivity through lean  ship from cell and our global sourcing efforts 
service gross profit from service revenue was for the twelve months ended december   compared to for the twelve months ended december  the decrease in gross profit is attributable to changes in the mix of service contracts and the unfavorable absorption of fixed service costs 
research and development research and development expense was million in  an increase of million  or  compared with million in the increase was primarily payroll costs due to increased headcount million  as well as increased amortization and depreciation costs for assets used as demonstration and or test systems million  increased project material costs million  and increased professional fee expenses million 
research and development expense was attributable to the following activities for for new product development  for improvement and enhancement of existing products  and for product testing 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expense was million in  an increase of million  or  compared with million in the increase was driven primarily by increased payroll costs million  increased travel costs million  increased freight costs million  increased miscellaneous other million  offset by decreased supplies and marketing costs million 
general and administrative general and administrative expense was million in  a decrease of million  or compared with million in the lower general and administrative expense in was driven primarily by decreased incentive compensation expense million  and decreased professional fee expenses million  offset by increased payroll costs million  increased separation costs associated with the retirement of a former executive of the company million and increased other miscellaneous costs million 
other income expense other income expense for the year ended december  primarily consisted of foreign exchange gains compared to foreign exchange losses in  as a result of us dollar currency fluctuations against the local currencies of certain of the countries in which we operate 
for the year ended december  the company incurred million of foreign exchange gains 
for the year ended december  the company incurred million of foreign exchange losses 
included in foreign exchange losses in are million of foreign exchange losses relating to currency hedging activities 
income taxes we incur income tax expense relating principally to operating results of foreign entities in jurisdictions in europe and asia  where we earn taxable income 
we have significant net operating loss carryforwards in the united states and certain european jurisdictions  and  as a result  we do not currently pay significant income taxes in those jurisdictions 
additionally we do not recognize the tax benefit for such losses in the united states and certain european taxing jurisdictions 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a tax expense of million related to an uncertain tax position in one of our european jurisdictions 
in  the company performed an evaluation of the deferred tax assets of certain of our foreign subsidiaries for which the company had previously established a valuation allowance 
based on the subsidiaries recent and expected ability to generate taxable income  the company reduced the subsidiaries corresponding valuation allowance and recognized a tax benefit of million 
year ended december  in comparison to the year ended december  revenue revenue increased significantly in compared to as the company benefited from improving market conditions and increased capacity utilization at customers manufacturing facilities 
the company expects this positive trend to continue into product product revenue  which includes systems sales  sales of spare parts and product upgrades  was million or of revenue in  compared with million  or of revenue in the increase in product revenue in is attributable to the strengthening of the semiconductor market and a related increase in capital spending by semiconductor manufacturers 
in addition  we also believe we are gaining market share with our single wafer ion implant systems for high current and high energy applications the optima hdx and optima xex  as customers are showing a higher acceptance of our technology 
approximately of systems revenue in was from sales of mm products and was from sales of mm products  compared with and for sales of mm products and mm products in  respectively 
a portion of our revenue from system sales is deferred until installation and other services related to future deliverables are performed 
the total amount of deferred revenue at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the increase was mainly due to the increase in systems sales in service service revenue  which includes the labor component of maintenance and service contracts and fees for service hours provided by on site service personnel  was million  or of revenue for  compared with million  or of revenue  for although service revenue should increase with the expansion of the installed base of systems  it can fluctuate from period to period based on capacity utilization at customers manufacturing facilities  which affects the need for equipment service 
the slight decrease during was primarily due to a decrease in fabrication utilization in the north american semiconductor industry 
royalties royalties were previously earned under our prior license agreement with sen 
as a result of the sale of our investment in sen  sen has had no further royalty obligations since march  royalty revenue was million or of revenue for revenue categories used by management as an alternative to the line item revenue categories discussed above  management also uses revenue categorizations which look at revenue by product line the most significant of which is ion implant and by aftermarket  as described below 
ion implant included in total revenue of million in is revenue from sales of ion implantation products and service of million  or of total revenue  compared with million  or  of total revenue in the dollar increase was due to the factors discussed above for product revenue

we refer to the business of selling spare parts and product upgrades  combined with the sale of maintenance labor and service contracts and service hours  as the aftermarket business 
included in total revenue of million in is revenue from our aftermarket business of million  compared to million for aftermarket revenue generally increases with expansion of the installed base of systems but can fluctuate from period to period based on capacity utilization at customers manufacturing facilities which affects the sale of spare parts and demand for equipment service 
gross profit product gross profit from product revenue was for the twelve months ended december   compared to for the twelve months ended december  approximately of the increase resulted from a lower provision for excess inventory 
the remaining increase in gross profit from product revenue is attributable to higher systems sales volume and the related favorable absorption of fixed overhead costs which increased gross margins by  offset by a decrease in gross margin resulting from an unfavorable mix of parts and upgrade revenue 
service gross profit from service revenue was for the twelve months ended december   compared to for the twelve months ended december  the decrease in gross profit is attributable to lower volumes 
research and development research and development expense was million in  an increase of million  or  compared with million in the increase was primarily payroll costs due to increased headcount million  increased professional fee expenses million  increased project material costs million  and increased asset amortization and depreciation costs for assets used as demonstration and or test systems million

general and administrative general and administrative expense was million in  a decrease of million  or compared with million in the decrease was driven primarily by decreased professional fee expenses million primarily due to legal transaction costs and business outsourcing activities being incurred in and a decrease in other miscellaneous costs million  offset by increased payroll and incentive compensation costs million 
other income expense equity loss attributable to sen was million for the year ended december  as a result of the sale of the company s investment in sen  subsequent to march   the company no longer records equity income or loss from sen 
interest income of million for the year ended december   primarily relates to interest earned on cash and cash equivalents 
interest income decreased by million from the year ended december   primarily due to lower average cash balances and lower interest rates 
we had no interest expense for the year ended december  our interest expense was million for the year ended december  we have had no borrowings since we paid in full our convertible senior subordinated notes on march  for the year ended december  and the company incurred million of foreign exchange losses 
included in foreign exchange losses in are 
million of foreign exchange losses relating to currency hedging activities 
the primary reason for foreign exchange losses in both years was due to the weakening of the u 
s dollar 
income taxes we incur income tax expense relating principally to operating results of foreign entities in jurisdictions  principally in asia  where we earn taxable income 
we have significant net operating loss carryforwards in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions  principally europe  and  as a result  we do not currently pay significant income taxes in those jurisdictions and we do not recognize the tax benefit for such losses as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  our effective income tax rate is not meaningful 
in  the company performed an evaluation of the deferred tax assets of certain of our foreign subsidiaries for which the company had previously established a valuation allowance 
based on the subsidiaries recent and expected ability to generate taxable income  the company reduced the subsidiary s corresponding valuation allowance and recognized a tax benefit of million 
liquidity and capital resources capital expenditures were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we have no significant capital projects planned for and total capital expenditures for are projected to be less than million 
future capital expenditures beyond will depend on a number of factors  including the timing and rate of expansion of our business and our ability to generate cash to fund them 
we have outstanding standby letters of credit  statutory liability deposits and surety bonds in the amount of million to support certain operating programs  workers compensation insurance  and certain value added tax claims in europe  of which  at december  was supported by cash pledged as collateral 
the pledged cash is reflected as long term restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet 
the following represents our commercial commitments as of december  in thousands amount of commitment expiration by period other commercial commitments total thereafter surety bonds standby letters of credit statutory liability deposits the following represents our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total thereafter purchase order commitments operating leases we have no off balance sheet arrangements at december  our liquidity is affected by many factors 
some of these relate specifically to the operations of our business  for example  the rate of sale of our optima and integra products  and others relate to the uncertainties of global economies  including the availability of credit  and the condition of the overall semiconductor equipment industry 
we have net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards the tax effect of which aggregate million at december  these carryforwards  which expire principally between and  are available to reduce future income tax liabilities in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions 
in  million of cash was generated by operating activities compared to a cash use of million in the million increase in cash generated by operations in was predominately driven by the company s income from operations in addition to noncash charges for depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation expense 
cash and cash equivalents at december  were million  compared to million at december  working capital at december  was million 
approximately million of cash is located in foreign jurisdictions as of december  it is company policy to provide taxes for the total anticipated tax impact of the undistributed earnings of our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries as such earnings are not expected to be reinvested indefinitely 
the company anticipates that us tax resulting from remitting such earnings will be off set by net operating loss or credit carryforwards to the extent available 
in addition  the company does not anticipate incurring a foreign withholding tax on remitting such earnings since it does not intend to remit the earnings as dividends 
on april   the company amended its existing revolving credit facility with a bank 
the amended agreement provides for borrowings up to million based primarily on accounts receivable 
the facility has certain financial covenants requiring us to maintain minimum levels of operating results and liquidity 
the agreement will terminate on april  the company uses the facility to support letters of credit and hedging transactions 
on december   the company entered into a modification agreement relating to this facility  which revises the company s covenant to require a minimum trailing six month adjusted net income as defined in the agreement for the six month period ending december  of 
at december  the company s available borrowing capacity under the amended credit facility was million and the company was compliant with all covenants of the loan agreement 
we believe that based on our current market  revenue and expense forecasts  our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements in the short and long term 
our forecast reflects revenue and gross margins consistent with our understanding of customer plans  the market conditions currently forecasted by the industry  and capacity utilization at customers manufacturing facilities 
related party transactions there are no significant related party transactions that require disclosure in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   or in this annual report on form k 
recent accounting pronouncements a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements is included in note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included in this annual report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity axcelis exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio  which consists entirely of cash equivalents at december  the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by investing in marketable high investment grade securities and limiting exposure to any one issue or issuer 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in managing our investment portfolio and  due to the nature of our investments  we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by any change in market interest rates 
foreign currency exchange risk substantially all of our sales are billed in us dollars  thereby reducing the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on our results 
operating margins of certain foreign operations can fluctuate with changes in foreign exchange rates to the extent revenues are billed in us dollars and operating expenses are incurred in the local functional currency 
during the years ended december  and  approximately and of our revenue were derived from foreign operations with this inherent risk 
in addition  at both december  and  our operations outside of the united states accounted for approximately and of our total assets  respectively  the majority of which was denominated in currencies other than the us dollar
