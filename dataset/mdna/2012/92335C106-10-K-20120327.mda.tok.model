overview vera bradley is a leading designer  producer  marketer  and retailer of stylish and highly functional accessories for women 
our products include a wide offering of handbags  accessories  and travel and leisure items 
over our year history  vera bradley has become a true lifestyle brand that appeals to a broad range of consumers 
our brand vision is accessible luxury that inspires a casual  fun  and family oriented lifestyle 
we have positioned our brand to highlight the high quality  distinctive and vibrant styling  and functional design of our products 
frequent releases of new designs help keep the brand fresh and our customers continually engaged 
we generate revenues by selling products through two reportable segments direct and indirect 
as of january   our direct business consisted of sales of vera bradley products through our full price stores and eight outlet stores in the united states  seven temporary  pop up stores in japan  our websites  verabradley 
com and verabradley 
co 
jp  and our annual outlet sale in fort wayne  indiana 
we began selling directly to consumers through verabradley 
com in calendar year  opened our first retail stores in calendar year  and entered the japanese market in calendar year as of january   our indirect business consisted of sales of vera bradley products to approximately  specialty retailers  substantially all of which are located in the united states  as well as to select national retailers and independent e commerce retailers 
in recent years  we have grown rapidly as a result of the successful implementation of strategic initiatives 
these initiatives included enhancing our merchandising strategy  establishing a multi channel distribution sales model  expanding our supply chain capabilities  product development processes  and information systems to improve operational flexibility and profitability 
in fiscal  we continued to experience strong demand for our brand across all of our sales channels  as reflected in our net revenue growth of 
in our direct segment  net revenues increased  including an increase of million in revenues related to the opening of new stores  a million  or  increase in e commerce revenues  and a comparable store sales increase of 
in our indirect segment  net revenues increased  driven primarily by the strength of product offerings  improved productivity through our retail partners  and the sale of certain retired inventory 
additionally  we achieved operating income of million for the fiscal year ended january   compared to an operating income of million in the fiscal year ended january  operating income for fiscal  included million of compensation expense related to restricted stock awards 
we remain focused on executing our growth strategies  which includes growing in underpenetrated markets and expanding our store base and product offering 
we believe there is a significant opportunity to grow our store base  as we believe the market in the united states can support at least vera bradley full price stores 
to that end  in fiscal we opened full price stores and four outlet stores and began retail operations in three new states 
we partnered with dillard s to launch our products in locations 
we also introduced our brand in japan through a combination of pop up stores and the launch of a japanese language website 
we also began an expansion of approximately  square feet of our distribution facility in roanoke  indiana 
we believe the combination of our expanding product offerings and continued growth in underpenetrated markets will lead to meaningful growth opportunities in the coming years 

table of contents we expect our full price stores to average approximately  square feet per store  and we expect to invest approximately million per new store  consisting of inventory costs  pre opening costs and build out costs less tenant improvement allowances 
new full price stores are expected to generate on average between million and million in net revenues during the first twelve months  and the payback on our investment is expected to occur in less than months 
typically  we have found that  as a new store becomes better integrated into its community and brand awareness grows  the store s productivity tends to improve as measured by comparable store sales 
we believe our business strategy will continue to offer significant opportunity  but it also presents risks and challenges 
these risks and challenges include that we may not be able to effectively predict and respond to changing fashion trends and customer preferences  that we may not be able to find desirable locations for new stores  and that we may not be able to effectively manage our future growth 
addressing these risks could divert our attention from continuing to build on the strengths that we believe have driven the growth of our business  but we believe our focus on brand identity  customer loyalty  a distinctive shopping experience  product development expertise  and company culture will contribute positively to our results 
how we assess the performance of our business in assessing the performance of our business  we consider a variety of performance and financial measures 
net revenues net revenues reflect revenues from the sale of our merchandise and from distribution and shipping and handling fees  less returns and discounts 
revenues for the direct segment reflect sales through our full price and outlet stores  pop up stores in japan  our websites  verabradley 
com and verabradley 
co 
jp  and our annual outlet sale in fort wayne  indiana 
revenues for the indirect segment reflect sales to indirect specialty retailers and department stores 
comparable store sales comparable store sales are calculated based upon our stores that have been open at least full fiscal months as of the end of the reporting period 
remodeled stores are included in comparable store sales unless the store was closed for a portion of the current or comparable prior period or the remodel resulted in a significant change in square footage 
some of our competitors and other retailers calculate comparable or same store sales differently than we do 
as a result  data in this report regarding our comparable store sales may not be comparable to similar data made available by other companies 
non comparable store sales include sales from stores not included in comparable store sales 
measuring the change in year over year comparable store sales allows us to evaluate how our store base is performing 
various factors affect our comparable store sales  including overall economic trends  consumer preferences and fashion trends  competition  the timing of our releases of new patterns and collections  changes in our product mix  pricing  the level of customer service that we provide in stores  our ability to source and distribute products efficiently  
table of contents the number of stores we open and close in any period  and the timing and success of promotional and advertising efforts 
gross profit gross profit is equal to our net revenues less our cost of sales 
cost of sales includes the direct cost of purchased and manufactured merchandise  distribution center costs  operations overhead  duty  and all inbound freight costs incurred 
the components of our reported cost of sales may not be comparable to those of other retail and wholesale companies 
gross profit can be impacted by changes in volume  operational efficiencies  such as leveraging of fixed costs  promotional activities  such as free shipping  commodity prices such as cotton  and fluctuations in pricing structures 
prior to calendar year  we sourced the majority of our finished products domestically 
today  the significant majority of our products are sourced internationally 
during this same period  we began direct sourcing of our raw materials and brought management of logistics in house 
these sourcing changes  along with better cost management  contributed to improvements in gross margin over this period 
gross margin measures gross profit as a percentage of our net revenues 
selling  general  and administrative expenses sg a sg a expenses include selling  advertising  marketing  and product development  and administrative 
selling expenses include direct business expenses such as store expenses  employee compensation  and store occupancy and supply costs  as well as indirect business expenses consisting primarily of employee compensation and other expenses associated with sales to indirect retailers 
advertising  marketing  and product development expenses include employee compensation  media costs  creative production expenses  marketing agency fees  new product design costs  public relations expenses  and market research expenses 
a portion of our advertising expenses may be reimbursed by indirect retailers  and such amount is classified as other income 
administrative expenses include compensation costs for corporate functions  corporate headquarters occupancy costs  consulting and software expenses  and charitable donations 
sg a expenses increase as the number of stores increases  but not in the same proportion as the associated increase in revenues 
other income we support many of our indirect retailers marketing efforts by distributing certain catalogs and promotional mailers to current and prospective customers 
our indirect retailers reimburse us for a portion of the cost to produce these materials 
reimbursement received is recorded as other income 
the related cost to design  produce  and distribute the catalogs and mailers is recorded as sg a expense 
other income also includes proceeds from the sales of tickets to our annual outlet sale and the gain on the sale of certain life insurance policies 
operating income operating income equals gross profit less sg a expenses plus other income 
operating income excludes interest income  interest expense  and income taxes

the remaining million was attributable to lower average borrowing rates in the fiscal year ended january  income tax expense for fiscal  we recorded income tax expense of million at an effective tax rate of  which is consistent with us federal and state statutory rates 
the change in our effective tax rate from fiscal reflects a more normalized rate due to being subject to corporate level us federal and state income taxes for the full fiscal year

fiscal compared to fiscal net revenues for fiscal  net revenues increased million  or  to million  from million for fiscal indirect 
for fiscal  net revenues increased million  or  to million  from million for fiscal  due primarily to increased sales volume to our indirect retailers

the increase in selling expenses was due primarily to increased store operational costs attributable to new store openings as well as e commerce and store marketing initiatives to drive increased traffic 
the increase in selling expenses also resulted from the company holding two product introduction and educational events or premieres for indirect retailers during fiscal  compared to only one event during fiscal  and from other increased expenses as a result of the increase in net revenues 
these increases were partially offset by a million asset impairment charge  as further described below  recorded in fiscal no such charge was recorded in fiscal 
table of contents for fiscal  advertising  marketing  and product development expenses decreased million  or  to million  from million for fiscal as a percentage of net revenues  advertising  marketing  and product development expenses were and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
this decrease resulted primarily from reduced expenses associated with our co op marketing programs as a result of refining the marketing support for our indirect retailers

for fiscal  administrative expenses increased million  or  to million  from million for fiscal as a percentage of net revenues  administrative expenses were and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
this increase was due primarily to million of stock based compensation expense associated with the vesting of restricted stock awards in connection with our initial public offering as well as million of expense associated with bonuses paid to recipients of the restricted stock awards to satisfy tax obligations 
in addition  we incurred higher corporate personnel and other costs necessary to support our growth as well as increased professional services fees related in part to our transition from a private to a public company

the increase in our effective tax rate resulted from our change in tax status 
liquidity and capital resources general our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations 
we also have access to additional liquidity  if needed  through borrowings under our million amended and restated credit agreement 
historically  our primary cash needs have been for merchandise inventories  payroll  store rent  capital expenditures associated with opening new stores  debt repayments  operational equipment  and information technology 
the most significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents  merchandise inventories  accounts receivable  accounts payable  and other current liabilities 
we do not believe that the expansion of our direct business will materially alter the nature and levels of our accounts receivable and inventories  or require materially increased borrowings under our amended and restated credit agreement  in the near term 
we believe that cash flows from operating activities and the availability of borrowings under our amended and restated credit agreement or other financing arrangements will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements  anticipated capital expenditures  and debt payments for the foreseeable future 
cash flow analysis a summary of operating  investing  and financing activities is shown in the following table in thousands fiscal year ended january  january  january  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities consist primarily of net income adjusted for non cash items  including depreciation  amortization  deferred taxes  and stock based compensation  the effect of changes in assets and liabilities  and tenant improvement allowances received from landlords under our store leases 

table of contents net cash provided by operating activities was million for the fiscal year ended january  primarily driven by our net income in the current year 
this is slightly down from million for the fiscal year ended january   primarily due to additional income tax payments of million in the current year because of the conversion from an s corporation to a c corporation in the prior year making us subject to corporate level us federal and state income taxes 
in addition  cash flow decreased due to timing of payments to our vendors  which was more than offset by the improvements in our supply chain and inventory management processes which allowed inventory levels to grow much less than the prior year 
net cash provided by operating activities declined to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal this decrease was driven primarily by a million increase in cash outflows related to changes in operating assets and liabilities and a million increase in net deferred tax assets  offset in part by an increase of million in stock based compensation expense 
the increase in cash outflows related to changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted primarily from a million increase in inventories  partially offset by increased current liabilities related in part to inventory purchases and c corporation tax obligations 
net cash used in investing activities investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures for growth related to new store openings  operational equipment  and information technology investments 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the million increase in capital expenditures was driven primarily by the investments in new stores  including the opening of stores during fiscal  expansion of the distribution facility  and information technology investments 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  reflecting capital expenditures of million offset in part by million of cash provided as a result of the elimination of a compensating balance requirement in connection with the amendment and restatement of our credit agreement 
capital expenditures of million for fiscal were million higher than capital expenditures in fiscal  due primarily to increased investments in new stores  including the opening of twelve stores in fiscal compared to six stores during fiscal  and incremental investments in information technology and distribution assets 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal this was driven by million in investments in six new stores along with improvements in e commerce  million in information technology investments  and million in production and distribution equipment 
capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to be approximately million  including the build out of new stores and approximately million of spending related to the distribution center expansion 
net cash used in financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal  resulting from the net payments under our amended and restated credit agreement 
net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal  driven primarily by million of s corporation distributions including the final s corporation distribution of million and million of debt issuance costs  offset in part by ipo net proceeds of million and net borrowings of million under the credit agreement or amended and restated credit agreement 
net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal this included million in net repayments of borrowings under our credit agreement  million in repayments of vendor and related party debt  and million in distributions to our shareholders to fund tax liabilities due to our s corporation status 

table of contents amended and restated credit agreement on october   vera bradley designs  inc entered into an agreement to amend and restate its credit agreement with jpmorgan chase bank  as administrative agent  and certain other lenders 
the amended and restated credit agreement provides for a revolving credit commitment of million and matures on october  all borrowings under the amended and restated credit agreement are collateralized by substantially all of the company s assets 
the credit agreement is also guaranteed by the company 
the credit agreement requires the company to comply with various financial covenants  including a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than to and a leverage ratio of not more than to 
the agreement also contains various other covenants  including restrictions on the incurrence of certain indebtedness  liens  investments  acquisitions  and asset sales 
the company was in compliance with these covenants as of january  borrowings under the amended and restated credit agreement bear interest at either libor plus the applicable margin ranging from to or the alternate base rate as defined in the agreement plus the applicable margin ranging from to 
the applicable margin is tied to the company s leverage ratio 
in addition  the company is required to pay a quarterly facility fee as defined in the agreement ranging from to of the revolving credit commitment 
at january   the weighted average interest rate on the million of outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement was 
the company had borrowing availability of million under the agreement as of january  contractual obligations we enter into long term contractual obligations and commitments in the normal course of business  primarily debt obligations and non cancellable operating leases 
as of january   our contractual cash obligations over the next several periods are as follows payments due by period 
in thousands total less than year years years more than years debt to financial institutions 
debt to others 
operating leases 
purchase obligations 
total as of january   we had million principal amount due on october  under our amended and restated credit agreement 
estimated total interest and facility fee payments of million  due through october   based on our outstanding borrowings and the interest rates in effect under our amended and restated credit agreement as of january   have been excluded 
we have entered into financing agreements with certain vendors 
the amounts listed represent the outstanding balances under these agreements 
our store leases generally have initial lease terms of years and provide us with the option to renew the leases upon substantially the same terms and conditions as the original leases 
our future operating lease obligations would change if we were to exercise these options  or if we were to enter into new operating leases 
purchase obligations consist primarily of inventory purchase orders and include the expansion of our distribution facility in roanoke  indiana 
in addition  due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our uncertain tax positions at january   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 
therefore  million of uncertain tax positions have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  as well as the disclosures relating to contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our accounting policies  estimates  and judgments on an on going basis 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we evaluate the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates and believe that the following policies and estimates involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity and are most significant to reporting our results of operations and financial position  and are therefore discussed as critical 
the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
with respect to critical accounting policies  even a relatively minor variance between actual and expected experience can potentially have a materially favorable or unfavorable impact on subsequent results of operations 
our historical results for the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements  however  have not been materially impacted by such variances 
more information on all of our significant accounting policies can be found in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue from the sale of our products is recognized upon customer receipt of the product when collection of the associated receivables is reasonably assured  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed and determinable  and ownership and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer  which  for e commerce and most indirect sales  reflects an estimate of shipments that customers have not yet received 
the estimate of these shipments is based on shipping terms and historical delivery times 
significant changes in shipping terms or delivery times could materially impact our revenues in a given period 
we reserve for projected merchandise returns based on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable 
merchandise returns are often resalable merchandise and in the direct business are refunded by issuing the same payment tender of the original purchase and in the indirect business the customer is issued a credit to its account to apply to outstanding invoices 
merchandise exchanges of the same product at the same price are not considered merchandise returns 
product returns are often resalable through our annual outlet sale or other channels 
additionally  we reserve for other potential product credits and for customer shipments not yet received 
the total reserve for returns  customer shipments not yet received  and general credits was million and million at january   and january   respectively 
this represents a reduction to operating income of million and million  respectively 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
market is determined based on net realizable value  which includes costs to dispose 
appropriate consideration is given to obsolescence  excess quantities  and other factors  including the popularity of a pattern or product  in evaluating net realizable value 
we record valuation adjustments to our inventories  which are reflected in cost of sales  if the cost of specific inventory items on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory 
this adjustment calculation requires us to make assumptions and estimates  which are based on factors such as merchandise seasonality  historical trends  and estimated sales 
table of contents and inventory levels  including sell through of remaining units 
in addition  as part of inventory adjustments  we provide for inventory shrinkage based on historical trends from our physical inventory counts 
we perform physical inventory counts throughout the year and adjust the shrink provision accordingly 
inventory adjustments of million and million were recorded for these matters as of january   and january   respectively 
these adjustments related primarily to raw materials of discontinued patterns  as we have the ability to move discontinued finished goods through a number of channels  including the annual outlet sale  our website and outlet stores  and through liquidators as needed 
the decrease in the valuation adjustments during fiscal resulted primarily from our expanding outlet store channel  which we launched in november which has enabled us to increase our use of raw materials of discontinued patterns as well as an improved cycle counting process resulting in less shrink 
income taxes prior to october   we were taxed as an s corporation for federal income tax purposes under section of the internal revenue code  and therefore were not subject to federal and state income taxes subject to exception in a limited number of state and local jurisdictions that do not recognize the s corporation status 
on october   our s corporation status automatically terminated and we became subject to corporate level federal and state income taxes at prevailing corporate rates 
our effective tax rate is based on our pre tax income  statutory tax rates  tax laws and regulations  and tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions 
we establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain based upon one of the following the tax position is not more likely than not to be sustained  the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained  but for a lesser amount  or the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained  but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken 
taxing authorities periodically audit our income tax returns 
we believe that our tax filing positions are reasonable and legally supportable 
taxing authorities  however  may take a contrary position 
our results of operations and effective tax rate in a given period could be impacted if  upon final resolution with taxing authorities  we prevail in positions for which we have established reserves  or are required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves 
valuation of long lived assets property  plant  and equipment assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in evaluating an asset for recoverability  we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset at the store level  the lowest identifiable level of cash flow  if applicable 
if the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset is less than the carrying value  we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value  usually determined by an estimated discounted cash flow analysis of the asset 
factors used in the valuation of long lived assets include  but are not limited to  our plans for future operations  brand initiatives  recent operating results  and projected future cash flows 
with respect to our stores  we analyze store economics  location within the shopping center  the size and shape of the space  and desirable co tenancies in our selection process 
impairment charges are classified in sg a expenses 
the discounted cash flow models used to estimate the applicable fair values involve numerous estimates and assumptions that are highly subjective 
changes to these estimates and assumptions could materially impact the fair value estimates 
the estimates and assumptions critical to the overall fair value estimates include estimated future cash flow generated at the store level  and discount rates used to derive the present value factors used in determining the fair values
