item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition should be read together with the other financial information and consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including those discussed in risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a diversified provider of outsourced services and specialty products 
we perform a wide range of manufacturing  engineering  design  testing and other technical services  typically under multi year  sole source contracts with major companies and government agencies in the markets for industrial manufacturing and aerospace and defense electronics 
we are organized into two business groups  the industrial group and the electronics group 
the industrial group is comprised of sypris technologies  inc and its subsidiaries  which generates revenue primarily from the sale of manufacturing services to customers in the market for truck components and assemblies and from the sale of products to the energy and chemical markets 
the electronics group is comprised of sypris electronics  llc and its subsidiary  which generates revenue primarily from the sale of manufacturing services  technical services and products to customers in the market for aerospace and defense electronics 
we focus on those markets where we have the expertise  qualifications and leadership position to sustain a competitive advantage 
we target our resources to support the needs of industry leaders that embrace multi year contractual relationships as a strategic component of their supply chain management 
these contracts  many of which are sole source by part number and are for terms of up to five years  enable us to invest in leading edge processes or technologies to help our customers remain competitive 
the productivity  flexibility and economies of scale that can result offer an important opportunity for differentiating ourselves from the competition when it comes to cost  quality  reliability and customer service 
during the past three years  we have significantly improved our financial condition by reducing fixed costs  accelerating integration efficiencies  exiting certain unprofitable product lines  selling idle assets  reducing debt and entering into a new  more favorable debt facility 
while the commercial vehicle and trailer markets continue to rebound from historic lows within our industrial group  we continue to face challenges within our electronics group  such as the uncertainty in the worldwide macroeconomic climate and its impact on aerospace and defense spending patterns globally  as well as federal government spending in the us the us government s continued focus on addressing federal budget deficits and the growing national debt suggests a changing environment for the electronics group 
although defense spending is expected to remain a national priority within the federal budget  a fiscally constrained environment could prompt the government to seek additional deficit reduction by moderating discretionary spending  of which defense constitutes the majority share 
the administration and congress are engaged in vigorous discussion over alternative approaches to reduce the federal deficit and curtail spending 
some revision to current national security spending could emerge in forthcoming budget plans and appropriations as these negotiations continue 
there can be no assurance at this time regarding when and how this matter will be resolved or its effects on the overall us economy or federal budgets 
in this context  the department of defense is currently conducting a strategic review intended to guide its budgeting decisions 
our company awaits the results of this review  as well as the outcomes of the broader federal budget discussion  as these decisions are expected to shape planning directions across the industry 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported 
changes in facts and circumstances could have a significant impact on the resulting estimated amounts included in our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more complex judgments and estimates 
we also have other policies that we consider to be key accounting policies  such as our policies for revenue recognition in the industrial group  including cost of sales  however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting policies because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we establish reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable based on overall receivable aging levels  a specific evaluation of accounts for customers with known financial difficulties and evaluation of customer chargebacks  if any 
these reserves and corresponding write offs could significantly increase if our customers experience deteriorating financial results or in the event we receive a significant chargeback  which is deemed uncollectible 
goodwill 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually as of december or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would warrant such a review 
the company assesses recoverability using a discounted cash flow analysis and comparisons of multiples of enterprise values to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
the analysis is based upon available information regarding expected future cash flows of each reporting unit discounted at rates consistent with the cost of capital specific to the reporting unit 
a growth rate is used to calculate the terminal value of the reporting unit and is added to the present value of the forecasted cash flows 
the growth rate is the expected rate at which a reporting unit s cash flow is projected to grow beyond the period covered by the long range plan 
the cash flow analysis requires significant judgment in our evaluation of the business and establishing an appropriate discount rate and terminal value to apply in the calculation 
in selecting these and other assumptions for each business  we consider historical performance  forecasted operating results  expected changes in product mix  general market conditions and industry considerations specific to the business 
we make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows  growth rates and discount rates 
the cash flows are estimated over a future period of time  which makes those estimates and assumptions inherently subject to a high degree of potential uncertainty 
the sum of the calculated fair values of each reporting unit is then reconciled and compared to our total market capitalization  allowing for a reasonable control premium 
if the discounted cash flow analysis yields a fair value estimate less than the reporting unit s carrying value  we proceed to step two of the impairment process 
in the second step  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
as a result of the first step of the goodwill impairment analysis performed as of december   the fair value estimate for the electronics group  which is our only reporting unit with goodwill  exceeded its carrying value by approximately 
therefore the second step was not necessary 
key assumptions used to determine the fair value estimate of our electronics group were the expected after tax cash flows for the period from to  which include projected improvements in operating margins  a terminal growth rate of and a weighted average cost of capital of 
the terminal rate is consistent with the prior year growth rate of 
our analysis included a comparison of our market capitalization to the fair value of the entire enterprise 
these and other estimates and assumptions are impacted by economic conditions and expectations of management and may change in the future based on period specific facts and circumstances 
we believe that the assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair value of our reporting unit were reasonable 
however  different assumptions could materially affect the results 
if the electronics group s future cash flows are different than those projected by management  future impairment charges may be required 
the company will continue to monitor the performance of the electronics group  the performance of the overall aerospace and defense industry and the company s market capitalization 
net revenue and cost of sales 
net revenue of products and services under commercial terms and conditions are recorded upon delivery and passage of title  or when services are rendered 
related shipping and handling costs  if any  are included in costs of sales 

table of contents net revenue under long term  fixed price contracts with aerospace and defense companies and agencies of the us government is recognized upon shipment 
contract profits are taken into earnings based on actual cost of sales for units shipped 
amounts representing contract change orders or claims are included in revenue when such costs are invoiced to the customer 
long lived asset impairment 
we perform periodic impairment analysis on our long lived amortizable assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
when indicators are present  we compare the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows of the operations to which the assets relate to their carrying amount 
if the operations are determined to be unable to recover the carrying amount of their assets  the long lived assets are written down to their estimated fair value 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows  third party appraisals or other methods that provide appropriate estimates of value 
a considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the impairment test  principally in determining whether an adverse event or circumstance has triggered the need for an impairment review 
we recorded immaterial amounts of impairment charges in and while we believe our judgments and assumptions were reasonable  changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could result in a material impact to our consolidated financial statements in any given period 
pension plan funded status 
the calculation of pension assets and liabilities involve complex estimation processes dependent on assumptions developed by us in consultation with our outside advisors such as actuaries 
the assumptions used  including discount rates and return on plan assets  have a significant impact on plan expenses and obligations 
changes in these rates could significantly impact the actuarially determined amounts recorded in the statements of financial position 
if actual experience differs from expectations  our financial position and results of operations in future periods could be affected 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
a change in the assumed pension discount rate of basis points would result in a change in our pension obligation as of december  of approximately million 
a basis point change in the assumed rate of return would change the estimated pension expense by approximately million 
discount rates are based upon the construction of a theoretical bond portfolio  adjusted according to the timing of expected cash flows for the future obligations 
a yield curve is based on a subset of these fixed income investments 
the projected cash flows are matched to this yield curve and a present value is developed which is then calibrated to develop a single equivalent discount rate 
pension benefits are funded through deposits with trustees that satisfy  at a minimum  the applicable funding regulations 
expected investment rates of return are based upon input from the plan s investment advisors and actuary regarding our expected investment portfolio mix  historical rates of return on those assets  projected future asset class returns and long term market conditions and inflation expectations 
we believe that the long term asset allocation on average will approximate the targeted allocation  and we regularly review the actual asset allocation to periodically rebalance the investments to the targeted allocation when appropriate 
actuarial gains or losses may result from changes in assumptions or when actual experience is different from that expected 
under applicable standards  those gains and losses are not required to be immediately recognized as expense  but instead may be deferred as part of accumulated other comprehensive income and amortized into expense over future periods 
reserve for excess  obsolete and scrap inventory 
we record inventory at the lower of cost  determined under the first in  first out method  or market  and we reserve for excess  obsolete or scrap inventory 
these reserves are primarily based upon management s assessment of the salability of the inventory  historical usage of raw materials  historical demand for finished goods and estimated future usage and demand 
an improper assessment of salability or improper estimate of future usage or demand  or significant changes in usage or demand could result in significant changes in the reserves and a positive or a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations in the period the change occurs 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions using the black scholes option pricing method  which requires the input of several subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the 
table of contents expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate of stock based compensation and consequently  the related expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes as required by the provisions of asc  income taxes  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using enacted tax rates 
management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and the related balance sheet amounts 
in addition  under asc  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  judgments are required concerning the ultimate outcome of uncertain income tax positions 
actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates  depending upon changes in income tax laws  actual results of operations and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities 
tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed 
we believe that our recorded income tax liabilities adequately provide for the probable outcome of these assessments 
deferred tax assets are also recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
however  asc requires that a valuation allowance be recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
this assessment is largely dependent upon projected near term profitability including the effects of tax planning 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined separately for each tax jurisdiction in which we conduct our operations or otherwise incur taxable income or losses 
we have recorded valuation allowances against deferred tax assets in the us and mexico where realization has been determined to be uncertain 
however  our mexican operation  which has historically generated taxable income and expects to continue to be profitable for the foreseeable future  also has certain deferred tax assets that are expected to be realized and therefore no valuation allowance has been recorded against such assets as of december  since future financial results may differ from previous estimates  periodic adjustments to our valuation allowance may be necessary 

table of contents results of operations we operate in two segments  the industrial group and the electronics group 
the table presented below  which compares our segment and consolidated results of operations from one year to another  presents the results for each year  the change in those results from one year to another in both dollars and percentage change and the results for each year as a percentage of net revenue 
the first two data columns in the table show the absolute results for each year presented 
the columns entitled year over year change and year over year percentage change show the change in results  both in dollars and percentages 
these two columns show favorable changes as positive and unfavorable changes as negative 
for example  when our net revenue increases from one year to the next  that change is shown as a positive number in both columns 
conversely  when expenses increase from one year to the next  that change is shown as a negative number in both columns 
the last two columns in the table show the results for each period as a percentage of net revenue 
in these two columns  the cost of sales and gross profit for each segment are given as a percentage of that segment s net revenue 
these amounts are shown in italics

table of contents net revenue 
the industrial group derives its revenue from manufacturing services and product sales 
net revenue in the industrial group increased million from the prior year to million for the year ended december  increased volumes for medium and heavy duty commercial truck components contributed to increased revenue of approximately million 
increased volumes for trailer axle beams resulted in an million net revenue increase 
manufacturing services for a new commercial vehicle customer resulted in increased revenue of million 
increased sales volumes for the off highway business contributed to increased revenue of million 
additionally  sales of our specialty closure products increased million 
increased steel prices  which are contractually passed through to customers under certain contracts  and pricing adjustments also contributed to increased revenue of approximately million in the electronics group derives its revenue from product sales and technical outsourced services 
net revenue in the electronics group decreased million to million in the decrease from the prior year is due in part to the completion of certain electronic manufacturing and engineering services programs and changes in product mix within our space business 
the completed programs primarily consisted of circuit board assembly services provided to certain contractors for the us government 
although the electronics group continues to provide electronic manufacturing services to us prime government contractors and other subcontractors  we are pursuing those programs which align with our high reliability capabilities for aerospace and defense customers and typically involve manufacturing lower volume  higher mix components 
additionally  the electronics group was affected by the delayed approval by congress of the fiscal defense appropriations bill 
partially offsetting this was an increase of million in product sales due to an increase in sales to foreign governments 
revenues for our electronics group are expected to remain relatively flat in gross profit 
the industrial group s gross profit increased million to million in as compared to million in the prior year 
the increase in sales volume resulted in an increase in gross profit of approximately million 
price increases resulted in an increase in gross profit of million over the prior year 
the industrial group also realized an increase in gross profit of million as a result of productivity improvements 
partially offsetting this was a million cost increase due to the strengthening of the mexican peso as compared to the prior year and other inflationary items 
the electronics group s gross profit decreased million to million in primarily as a result of the decline in revenue  particularly in the higher margin electronic manufacturing services business and additional engineering charges allocated to improvements in our product portfolio 
the electronics group s gross profit as a percentage of revenue for decreased to from in selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense increased million in however  selling  general and administrative expense decreased as a percentage of revenue to in from in the company has continued to limit increases in controllable general and administrative expenses as revenues have increased in its industrial group 
research and development 
research and development costs were million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively  in support of the electronics group s self funded product and technology development activities 
restructuring expense  net 
as a result of the company s restructuring program  we recorded million and million related to these initiatives during and  respectively 
the charge for the year ended december  consisted of million in equipment relocation costs and million in other various charges  primarily related to mothball costs  partially offset by a million gain on the sale of assets that had previously been impaired 
the charge for the year ended december  consisted of million for employee severance and benefit costs  million in equipment relocation costs and million in other various charges  primarily related to mothball costs associated with closed or partially closed facilities and charges related to the consolidation of two electronics group locations 
the restructuring program is substantially complete as of december   and we do not expect to incur any material costs in under this restructuring program 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
nonrecurring income expense 
during  the company recognized a gain of million in connection with a settlement regarding prior year volumes with one of its customers 

table of contents interest expense  net 
interest expense for the year ended december  decreased million due to a decrease in the weighted average debt outstanding and a decrease in the weighted average interest rate  partially offset by the write off of million in unamortized loan costs and additional fees paid in conjunction with the repayment of our former revolving credit agreement and senior notes 
our weighted average debt outstanding decreased to million during from million during the weighted average interest rate decreased to in from in other income expense  net 
other income expense  net increased million to million for from million in other income for the year ended december  includes a gain of million from the sale of idle assets within the industrial group 
the company also recognized foreign currency translation gains of million in related to the net us dollar denominated monetary asset position of our mexican subsidiary for which the mexican peso is the functional currency 
other income  net for the year ended december  includes a gain of million from the sale of idle equipment within the industrial group partially offset by foreign currency translation losses of million 
income taxes 
the income tax provision consists of current and deferred tax expense of million and million  respectively 
the income tax provision consists of current and deferred tax expense of million and million  respectively 
the current tax expense in both years is primarily attributable to taxes paid by our mexican subsidiary 
included in deferred tax expense in both years is an increase in the valuation allowance on us deferred tax assets  including the transfer in of a liability and related deferred tax asset from our mexican subsidiary to a us subsidiary 
our mexican subsidiary recognized a deferred tax benefit in both years related to the recovery of certain deferred tax assets that were previously reserved for by a valuation allowance 
discontinued operations 
on october   the company sold all of the outstanding stock of its wholly owned subsidiary  sypris test measurement  for approximately million 
in accordance with requirements of asc  the results of the test measurement segment have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
during  the company was made aware of a potential indemnification claim from the purchaser of sypris test measurement 
as of december   the company estimates that its total liability arising from this claim will not exceed million  of which million and million was charged to loss from discontinued operations  net of tax for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the loss from discontinued operations for the year ended december  also includes charges of million for legal expenses incurred in connection with the claim 
there can be no assurance that relevant facts and circumstances will not change  necessitating future changes to the estimated liability 

table of contents quarterly results the following table presents our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the two year period ended december  the quarterly results are presented on a week period basis 
we have prepared this data on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements and  in our opinion  have included all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of this information 
you should read these unaudited quarterly results in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k

table of contents liquidity and capital resources on may   the company entered into a new credit facility credit facility providing total availability up to million that supports short term funding needs and letters of credit  which replaced the company s revolving credit agreement and senior notes scheduled to mature in january loans made under the credit facility will mature and the commitments thereunder will terminate in may the credit facility provides for an option  subject to certain conditions  to increase total availability to million in the future 
borrowing availability under the credit facility is determined by a monthly borrowing base collateral calculation that is based on specified percentages of the value of eligible accounts receivable  inventory and machinery and equipment  less certain reserves and subject to certain other adjustments 
at december   we had total excess availability under the credit facility of million along with an unrestricted cash balance of million  which provides for total cash and available borrowing capacity of million 
approximately million of the unrestricted cash balance relates to our mexican subsidiaries 
standby letters of credit up to a maximum of million may be issued under the credit agreement of which million were issued at december  we also had purchase commitments totaling approximately million at december   primarily for inventory and manufacturing equipment 
obligations under the credit facility are guaranteed by all of our us subsidiaries and are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all domestic assets of the company 
the credit facility contains a number of covenants that  among other things  limit or restrict our ability to dispose of assets  incur additional indebtedness  incur guarantee obligations  engage in sale and leaseback transactions  prepay other indebtedness  modify organizational documents and certain other agreements  create restrictions affecting subsidiaries  make dividends and other restricted payments  create liens  make investments  make acquisitions  engage in mergers  change the nature of our business and engage in certain transactions with affiliates 
there are numerous risks and uncertainties relating to the global economy and the commercial vehicle and aerospace and defense industries that could materially affect our financial condition  future results of operations and liquidity 
these risks and uncertainties could result in decreased sales  limited access to credit  rising costs  increased competition  customer or supplier bankruptcies  delays in customer payment terms and acceleration of supplier payments  growing inventories and failure to meet debt covenants 
as a result of a decline in the overall economy  we took significant actions throughout  and to reduce our cost base and improve profitability  including various plant shutdowns and other workforce reductions 
based on our current forecast for  we expect to be able to meet the financial covenants of our credit facility and have sufficient liquidity to finance our operations 
however  changing business  regulatory and economic conditions may mean that actual results will vary from our forecasts 
for more information  please refer to risk factors in item a of this annual report on form k 
our ability to service our indebtedness will require a significant amount of cash 
our ability to generate this cash will depend largely on future operations 
based upon our current level of operations and our business plan  we believe that cash flow from operations  available cash and available borrowings under our credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months 
financial condition operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was million in  as compared to million in the cash flow associated with our accounts receivable and inventory during reflects the change in net revenue mix between our industrial and electronics groups 
the industrial group s net revenue increase of million resulted in cash investments in accounts receivable and inventory of million and million  respectively 
the electronics group s net revenue decrease of million contributed to a decrease in accounts receivable of million 
however  inventory within the electronics group increased primarily as a result of the timing of shipments and used million of cash 
accounts payable increased during and provided million primarily due to increased purchases by our industrial group and the timing of payments to our suppliers 

table of contents investing activities 
net cash used by investing activities was million in as compared to net cash used of million in net cash used in investing activities included million of capital expenditures 
additionally  the industrial group sold certain idle equipment during the year  which generated million of cash 
if revenues continue to increase within the industrial group  the company expects capital expenditures will increase in future periods to support the growth 
net cash used in investing activities in includes capital expenditures of million partially offset by proceeds from the sale of assets of million 
financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  due to the repayment of debt under the company s former revolving credit agreement and senior notes partially offset by borrowings of million under the new credit facility 
the company also paid million of deferred loan costs during the year in conjunction with the new credit facility 
the company s financing activities were cash neutral in off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any material off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources
