we review certain financial measures in assessing our financial condition and operating performance not only in connection with creating our internal forecasts and in making comparisons to financial results from prior periods  but also in making comparisons to our competitors financial results 
we focus on fluctuations in revenue  cost and gross margin and also pay close attention to changes in our consolidated operating income  net income  diluted earnings per share  adjusted ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  including asset charges and loss contingencies and share based compensation  cash flows from operations and free cash flow cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures as they are key indicators of our success 
we also measure changes in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses as a percent of revenue  which indicate management s ability to control costs  as well as changes in research and development r d costs as a percent of revenue  which demonstrate investment in technology and product development 
the measures listed above are not a comprehensive list of all factors considered by us in assessing our 
table of contents financial condition and operating performance  and we may consider other individual measures as required by trends and discrete events arising in a specific period  but they are the key indicators 
we continue to operate in a challenging economic environment 
the gaming sector was and continues to be negatively impacted by lower consumer spending and limited resources available to fund capital projects 
as a result of the challenging economic environment  we have provided select customers a greater amount of payment terms for periods up to one year  and in some cases for periods up to three years 
we expect to continue to extend credit for these longer periods for the foreseeable future 
there are several new and potential gaming market developments that we believe will benefit us in the long term 
in our domestic market  we are focused on approved new jurisdictional opportunities and expansions in canada  illinois  ohio  kansas  maryland  louisiana  mississippi  florida  massachusetts  pennsylvania  maine and california  and the potential for new market opportunities in new hampshire  kentucky and texas 
the breadth and timing of such opportunities remain uncertain due to the legislative process in these jurisdictions  as well as the difficult credit environment facing certain of our customers and the risk of the gaming industry impact of continued economic uncertainty 
we are also engaged in expanding our position in south africa  australia  new zealand  and mexico  and  in the future  we also expect to generate revenue from the italian video lottery terminal vlt market and from potential new markets in eastern europe  greece  taiwan  south korea  japan  vietnam  the philippines and brazil 
our entry into the italian vlt market has been delayed by a lengthened regulatory approval process that developed in that market after we submitted our products for approval 
as a result  certain customers and partners have modified their business approach to the market  which has delayed and  at least in the near term  reduced the amount of business we expected from the italian vlt market 
we received regulatory approval for our products and began deploying vlts in italy during july gaming equipment year ended june  dollars in millions  except asp revenues new gaming devices new unit average selling price asp

off balance sheet arrangements we are party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk  such as performance bonds and other guarantees not reflected in our balance sheet that arise in the normal course of business

critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
accordingly  we are required to make estimates incorporating judgments and assumptions we believe are reasonable based on our historical experience  contract terms  trends in our company and the industry as a whole  as well as information available from other outside sources 
our estimates affect amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from initial estimates 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  description of business and summary of significant accounting principles 
we consider the following accounting policies to be the most important to understanding and evaluating our financial results 
these policies require management to make subjective and complex judgments that are inherently uncertain or variable 
we have discussed the development  selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition our policy is to record revenue when all of the following criteria have been satisfied persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price or fee to the customer is fixed or determinable  collectability is reasonably assured  delivery has occurred  and no significant contractual obligations remain 

table of contents revenues are reported net of incentive rebates  discounts  sales taxes  and all other items of a similar nature except for gaming industry taxes on certain gaming operations revenue 
the gross amounts of these gaming taxes are not presented separately in the financial statements because they are not significant 
for products sold under arrangements with extended payment terms the probability of collection is evaluated based on a review of the customer s credit worthiness and a review of historic collection experience on contracts with extended payment terms 
as a result of such review  we recognize revenue on extended payment term arrangements when we have determined that collectability is reasonably assured and the fee is considered fixed and determinable 
games placed with customers on a trial basis are recorded as revenue once the trial period has ended  the customer has accepted the games and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied 
amounts billed to customers prior to completing the earnings process are deferred until the revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
effective july   we adopted new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition for multiple deliverable arrangements and certain revenue arrangements that include software elements 
this guidance was applied using the prospective method to all new or materially modified revenue arrangements entered into since the start of our fiscal year of adoption  which was july  prior to the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance gaming equipment and systems revenue was recognized in accordance with software revenue recognition guidance 
the new guidance amended the scope of software revenue recognition to exclude all tangible products containing both software and nonsoftware components that function together to deliver a product s essential functionality 
as a result of applying the new guidance  certain products that were previously accounted for under the scope of software revenue recognition guidance are no longer accounted for as software 
considerable judgment is necessary to determine whether certain of our products are within the scope of software revenue recognition and whether the software and nonsoftware elements of these products function together to deliver the essential functionality 
this determination dictates whether general revenue recognition guidance or software revenue recognition guidance applies which could impact the timing of revenue recognition 
gaming operations revenue 
gaming operations revenue consists of the operation of linked progressive systems and the rental of gaming devices  game content and the related systems placed with customers 
fees under these arrangements are earned and recognized based on a share of money wagered  a share of the net winnings  or on a fixed daily rate 
the daily fee entitles the customer to full use of the gaming device and includes maintenance  licensing of the game content software and connection to a linked progressive system  where applicable 
in certain markets  we also charge a daily system connection fee for the customer to connect to a central determination system and or back office system 
we do not consider these arrangements to have multiple revenue generating activities as the services offered are a comprehensive solution in exchange for a daily fee and all of the products and services are delivered contemporaneously 
gaming operations revenue is recognized under general revenue recognition guidance as the deliverables provide the customer with rights to use tangible gaming devices and software that is essential to the functionality of the gaming devices 
gaming equipment revenue 
gaming equipment revenue is generated from the sale of gaming devices and licensing rights to game content software that is installed in the gaming device  parts  and other ancillary equipment 
arrangements may also include sales of game content conversion kits which enable customers to replace game content without purchasing a new gaming device 
gaming equipment arrangements do not include maintenance and product support fees beyond a standard warranty period 
the recognition of revenue from the sale of gaming devices occurs as title and risk of loss have passed to the customer and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied 

table of contents as the combination of game content software and the tangible gaming device function together to deliver the product s essential functionality  revenue from the sale of gaming devices is recognized under general revenue recognition guidance 
prior to july   gaming devices were recognized under software revenue recognition guidance 
game content conversion kits are considered software deliverables and are recognized in accordance with software revenue recognition guidance 
systems revenue 
systems revenue arrangements generally include a combination of systems software licenses  systems based hardware products  maintenance and product support fees and professional services 
the primary function of systems software licensed by us is to aid customers to more effectively run their business with marketing  data management and analysis  accounting  player tracking and security features 
revenue for systems software and maintenance and product support fees is recognized under software revenue recognition guidance 
although the systems software and certain systems based hardware function together  the primary functionality of the systems software is derived from the software and the systems software is not essential to the functionality of the systems based hardware 
we license systems software on a perpetual basis or under time based licenses 
revenue from perpetual license software is recognized at the inception of the license term provided all revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied 
revenue from maintenance and product support fees sold with perpetual licenses is recognized over the term of the support period 
our time based licenses are generally for twelve month terms and are bundled with software maintenance and product support fees 
all revenue from such arrangements is recognized over the term of the license 
systems based hardware includes embedded software that is essential to the functionality of the hardware 
accordingly  revenue related to all systems based hardware sales and related maintenance and product support fees are recognized under general revenue recognition guidance 
prior to july   systems based hardware was recognized under software revenue recognition guidance 
revenue from the sale of systems based hardware is generally recognized upon delivery when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer and all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
however  in the case of arrangements involving a systems installation  revenue on systems based hardware is generally not recognized until the system has been installed and the customer has accepted the system 
hardware maintenance and product support fees are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the support period which is generally twelve months 
software maintenance and product support provides customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades  maintenance and patches released during the term of the support period 
our software maintenance and product support arrangements are generally for twelve month periods 
software maintenance and product support is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the support period 
multiple element arrangements 
we enter into revenue arrangements that may consist of multiple deliverables of our products and services 
for example  customers may enter into arrangements with us for the implementation of systems software and the sale of gaming devices 
arrangements for the implementation of systems software will generally include a combination of systems software licenses  systems based hardware products  maintenance and product support fees  and professional services 
certain gaming equipment arrangements may also include the sale of gaming devices and game content conversion kits 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are allocated to separate units of accounting if the deliverables meet both of the following criteria the delivered items have value to the customer on a standalone basis 
the items have value on a standalone basis if they are sold separately by any vendor or the customer could resell the delivered items on a standalone basis  and 
table of contents if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered items  delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in the control of us 
considerable judgment is required to determine whether an arrangement consists of multiple deliverables  whether each delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone basis and in determining the relative selling price used to allocate the arrangement fee to each deliverable 
such determination affects the amount and timing of revenue recognition 
management evaluates the primary use and functionality of each deliverable in determining whether a delivered item has stand alone value and qualifies as a separate unit of accounting 
judgments for revenue recognition also involve an assessment as to whether collectability is reasonably assured and whether fees under an arrangement are fixed or determinable 
at the inception of a multiple element arrangement  fees under the arrangement are allocated to the nonsoftware deliverables  and to the software deliverables as a group based on their relative selling price 
software deliverables are further subject to separation and allocation based on software revenue recognition guidance as described in the following paragraph 
when applying the relative selling price method  a hierarchy is used for estimating the selling price based first on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  then third party evidence tpe and finally management s estimate of the selling price esp 
revenue for each unit of accounting is recognized when the relevant recognition criteria for each respective element has been met 
in allocating arrangement fees under the relative selling price hierarchy  we use vsoe for all products which have been sold on a stand alone basis 
as tpe is generally not available  we use esp for products that are not sold on a stand alone basis and for recently introduced products that are sold on a stand alone basis but for which a history of stand alone sales has not yet been developed 
following these guidelines  we use either vsoe or esp for gaming devices  system based hardware products  maintenance and product support fees associated with perpetual licenses and professional services  and esp for perpetual and time based software licenses and maintenance and product support fees associated with time based licenses 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue allocated to software deliverables 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered element and is recognized as revenue 
in arrangements in which we do not have vsoe of fair value of all undelivered software elements  revenue is deferred until delivery occurs or vsoe of fair value has been established for any remaining undelivered software elements 
in the event the only undelivered software element is maintenance and product support for which vsoe of fair value does not exist  the revenue is recognized ratably over the maintenance and product support period 
the establishment of vsoe requires judgment as to whether there is a sufficient quantity of items sold on a stand alone basis and whether the prices demonstrate an appropriate level of concentration to conclude that vsoe exists 
in determining esp  management considers a variety of information including historic pricing and discounting practices  competitive market activity  internal costs  and the pricing and discounting practices of products sold in bundled arrangements 
inventories we regularly review inventory quantities and update estimates for the net realizable value of inventories to estimate potentially excess or obsolete inventory 
our process includes examining the carrying values of new and used gaming devices  parts and ancillary equipment in comparison to the current fair market values for such equipment less costs to sell or dispose 
the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products within specific time horizons  generally one year or less 
additional factors involved in this analysis include the overall 
table of contents levels of our inventories  the costs required to sell the products  including refurbishment costs and importation costs for international shipments  and the overall projected demand for products once the next generation of products are scheduled for release 
demand for parts inventory is also subject to technical obsolescence 
as a result of our ongoing analysis of inventory  we recognized inventory write downs totaling million  million and million during the years ended june   and  respectively 
additional valuation charges could occur in the future as a result of changes in the factors listed above 
leased gaming equipment leased gaming equipment is stated at cost and depreciated over estimated useful lives ranging from one to three and one half years 
the estimation of useful lives for our leased gaming equipment requires judgment and is based on the period of time over which we believe the assets will be of economic benefit 
given changes in technology  customer preferences and product demand  we review and evaluate the recoverability of our investment in such assets on a quarterly basis  as well as the estimated useful lives used to depreciate these assets 
there is the potential for acceleration of future depreciation  or asset impairments  if conditions were to change and certain factors were determined to have an adverse impact on our ability to realize our full investment in such assets 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill we review long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of long lived assets are measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future  net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset  undiscounted and without interest 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
we review goodwill for impairment annually at the beginning of our fourth fiscal quarter  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable or warrant a revision to the estimated remaining useful life 
we perform the impairment analysis of goodwill at a reporting unit level by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with our carrying value  including goodwill 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
we are required to make significant judgments and estimates regarding future cash flows  the determination of fair values and the identification of reporting units utilized in determining the fair value and recoverability of long lived assets and goodwill 
we believe our estimates are reasonable  however  if our estimates materially differ or factors utilized in developing our estimates change  different assumptions could materially affect our assessment of the fair value and recoverability of long lived assets and goodwill 
during the year ended june   impairment charges of million related to long lived assets were recorded see note to the consolidated financial statements  impairment charges 
during the years ended june  and  no impairment charges related to long lived assets were recorded 
during the years ended june   and  no impairment charges related to goodwill were recorded 

table of contents share based compensation we account for share based compensation based on the calculated fair value of the award measured on the grant date which is recognized  net of estimated forfeitures  as expense over the employee s requisite service period which is generally the vesting period of the equity grant 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based awards requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected option term and the expected volatility of our common stock over the option s expected term 
we believe that the valuation technique and the approach utilized to develop the underlying assumptions are appropriate in calculating the fair values of stock options granted  however  if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  share based compensation expense could be materially impacted 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate  and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
pre tax share based compensation expense from continuing operations was million  million and million during the years ended june   and  respectively 
as of june   there was million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested portion of stock options which will be recognized over the subsequent years 
in addition  as of june   there was million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested portion of restricted stock and restricted stock units rsus which will be recognized over the subsequent years 
income taxes we conduct business globally and are subject to income taxes in us federal  state  local  and foreign jurisdictions 
determination of the appropriate amount and classification of income taxes depends on several factors  including estimates of the timing and probability of realization of deferred income taxes  reserves for uncertain income tax positions and income tax payment timing 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date 
taxes on income of our foreign subsidiaries are provided at the tax rates applicable to the tax jurisdictions in which they are located 
the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets is based in part on estimates of future income and the timing of temporary differences  and the failure to fully realize such deferred tax assets could result in a higher tax provision in future periods 
our net deferred tax assets from continuing operations totaled million and million at june  and  respectively 
our accrued income taxes payable totaled million and million and our accrued income taxes receivable totaled million and million at june  and  respectively 
we have classified million of the accrued income taxes receivable at june  as long term as we do not expect collection of these amounts in the next twelve months 
we apply financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic accounting for uncertainty in income taxes to our uncertain tax positions 
under the guidance  we may recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain position only if it is more likely than not 
table of contents that the position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the issue 
the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that we believe has greater than a likelihood of being realized upon settlement 
we are required to make significant judgments when evaluating our uncertain tax positions and the related tax benefits 
we believe our assumptions are reasonable  however  there is no guarantee that the final outcome of the related matters will not differ from the amounts reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals 
we adjust our liability for uncertain tax positions based on changes in facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or changes in estimates 
our income tax provision may be impacted to the extent that the final outcome of these tax positions is different than the amounts recorded 
as of june  and  our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits totaled million and million  respectively 
of these amounts  million and million  respectively  if recognized  would impact the effective tax rate

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of june   we had total debt outstanding of approximately million which consisted primarily of a million term loan and million of borrowing under our revolving credit facility 
during the year  the interest rate for the credit facility was subject to a leveraged based pricing grid 
we have minimized our exposure to market interest rate risk because the variable interest rate on the term loan was effectively converted to a fixed rate as a result of the floating to fixed interest rate swaps entered into in december and june  respectively  and discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  long term debt 
as of june   the interest rate on the revolving credit facility was and the interest rate on our term loan was approximately  after giving effect to our interest rate swaps  given our leverage ratio was approximately for the period 
we estimate a hypothetical decline of bps in applicable interest rates would have an immaterial impact on our business because we manage this exposure with derivative financial instruments 
foreign currency exchange rate risk certain of our foreign subsidiaries use their local currency as their functional currency and are exposed to risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
during the years ended june  and  we recognized foreign currency exchange rate losses of approximately million and million respectively  and during the year ended june   we recognized a foreign currency exchange rate gain of approximately million 
we estimate that a hypothetical strengthening or weakening of the us dollar for fiscal year would have had an immaterial impact on our business 
in addition  the net assets of these subsidiaries are exposed to foreign currency translation gains and losses which are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders 
table of contents equity in our consolidated balance sheet 
such translation resulted in an unrealized loss of million for fiscal year and an unrealized gain of million for fiscal year we may enter into foreign currency forward contracts  generally with maturities of twelve months or less  to hedge recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities to reduce the reduce the risk that earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  summary of significant policies fair value of financial instruments 
during the fiscal year ended june   we borrowed and repaid million euro converted into million us dollars under our revolving credit facility 
there were no similar transactions in the fiscal year ended june
