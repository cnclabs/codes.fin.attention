summary of twelve months ended december  for the year ended december   we registered moderate growth and financial performance 
revenue increased by  reaching million  as compared to million in the year ended december  this growth was primarily from our digestive disease and anti viro infection and respiratory product categories 
net income for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of  from million in the year ended december  our net income figures for both years ended december  and include gains resulting from changes in derivative warrant liability 
without the effect of the changes in derivative warrant liability  management estimates that net income would have been approximately million and million in and the decrease in net income was mainly due to the decrease in gross profit margin  increase in income tax rate  and increase in operating expenses 
from a profitability perspective  our gross profit margin for the year ended december  was compared to in the decrease in gross profit margin was mainly due to margin compression as a result of the healthcare reform 
pricing pressure is now quite a prominent feature in the overall pharmaceutical market in china 
cash flow from operations for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of  as compared to million in the decrease in cash flow from operations in was the result of lower net income and also higher working capital usage from higher inventory  and lower account payables in as compared to earnings per common share basic and diluted for the year ended december  was per share compared to per share for the months ended december  business overview recent developments in the year ended december   we continued to execute our business strategy of expanding revenues from our core portfolio of products while continuing the development process of new products 
however the year was a challenging one as the implementation of the healthcare reform has resulted in high pricing pressure and lower gross profit margins across the board for almost all pharmaceutical products 
for our existing products  during the year we saw our digestive diseases product category take a lead in sales growth by increasing compared to the prior year period 
our anti viro infection and respiratory product category also saw healthy growth of 
cns cerebral cardio vascular category saw trend growth of while sales of other category fell as those products encountered stiffer competition 
the products in our pipe line progressed slowly but steadily along the development process are getting closer to product launch 
the sfda is also revamping its production approval criteria and processes  resulting in longer approval time for new production applications across all types of products 
in some cases they are adding additional requirements for product already under review 
in early we completed the clinical trials for candesartan  a front line drug therapy we developed for the treatment of hypertension 
we submitted a production approval application to the sfda for candesartan but the application moved very slowly through the sfda process 
we finally resumed communication with the sfda in the fourth quarter of and received a request for some additional procedure to be performed 
since then we have completed and submitted the requested material and we now have reason to believe that we will receive final production approval by mid year 
the clinical trial for rosuvastatin  or the generic version of crestor  was completed in december and we are in the process of applying for the production approval for this product 
in september  we also completed phase i of our clinical trial for our new antibiotic combination drug 
we are currently moving ahead and are in phase ii of the trial for this drug 
below we list the current status of some of our pipeline products antibiotic combination 
we completed the phase i clinical trials of our novel cephalosporin based combination antibiotic in the third quarter of we are currently in phase ii of the clinical trial progressing well 
rosuvastatin 
fourth quarter of clinical trial for rosuvastatin is a generic form of crestor  a drug for indication of high blood cholesterol level 
clinical trials for this generic drug was completed in fourth quarter of and we have submitted an application for production approval 
cadesartan 
we originally submitted application for production approval of candesartan  a front line drug therapy we developed for the treatment of hypertension  in we received request for additional procedures in the fourth quarter of and we have since completed all newly requested procedures and are currently waiting for the final production approval from the sfda 
we expect to hear from the sfda before the mid year mark 
heart disease drug 
we are developing a medicine for the treatment of coronary heart disease 
this product comes with a patented tcm formula and we are currently conducting phase iii clinical trials for this drug 
we anticipate the completion of the clinical work for this product by year end market trends the growth of china s pharmaceutical market is driven by china s rapid economic growth 
increased healthcare spending by the chinese government to reform the healthcare system has already greatly improved the accessibility of  and desire for  medical care 
important additional factors include the aging of the population and the resulting increase in age related disorders  the urban migration of the population  and improved awareness of personal health care 
the healthcare reform program announced by the chinese government in late is having a significant impact on all healthcare related industries in china  including the pharmaceutical industry 
over all  the government plans to provide a basic  universal healthcare system to all citizens of china 
in  the government began to broadly implement the policies from the healthcare reform 
in this respect  products on the essential drug list edl are expected to experience an increase in volume but a reduction in their prices  which will have an adverse affect on their net margins 
we believe volume expansion will continue as government subsidy to rural communities expands further 
during the past months  we have seen first hand the increase in demand for edl products  but along with the increase in demand  we also experienced some degradation in the pricing in compared to furthermore  we observed that there are significant variations in timing and market reaction to the new environment  causing sales volume to gyrate in some of the affected products 
while pricing is generally set at the central government level  provincial government intervention has added complexity to the pricing volume interaction 
in addition to edl products  we have also seen pricing pressure on most of the drugs we sell 
while these changes have more impact on pharmaceutical distribution companies  manufacturers of pharmaceutical products are also affected 
we believe the general implication is that gross margins for pharmaceutical products will continue to be under pressure for some time 
that being said  a pharmaceutical manufacturer with experienced management and the ability to react quickly to changes will not only survive but thrive in this environment 
results of operations for the year ended december  the following table presents our results of operations for the years ended december  and twelve months ended december change change revenue cost of revenue gross profit selling expenses general and administrative expenses bad debt expense government subsidy income income from operations net interest income expense derivative gain income tax expense net income basic net income per share basic weighted average shares outstanding diluted net income per share diluted weighted average shares outstanding revenue for the year ended december   our sales revenue was million  an increase of  compared to million in set forth below are our revenues by product category in millions usd for the years ended december  and product category twelve months ended december net change change cns cerebral cardio vascular anti viro infection respiratory digestive diseases other the most significant revenue growth was in our digestive diseases product category  which generated million in sales revenue compared to million a year ago  an increase of million  or 
this increase was driven mainly by sales of tiopronin  a drug prescribed for treatments of acute hepatitis b and drug induced liver damage  and compound ammonium glycyrrhetate  also a drug prescribed for treatments of liver dysfunctions 
sales of the anti viro infection respiratory category increased by to million in compared to million in  driven by increase in sales of our cefaclor dispersible tablets 
our cns  cardio cerebral vascular category experienced some additional growth in sales in this category generated million of sales  compared to million in the previous year  or an increase of 
our other product category sales fell to million from million  a decrease of million  or  as all products in this category encountered stronger competition this year compared to the last year 
in the year ended december   revenue breakdown by product category showed small changes 
sales of the anti viro respiratory products category represented of total sales in the year ended on december   compared to in the cns  cerebral cardio vascular category was steady  representing of total revenue in both and the digestive diseases category represented of total revenue in compared to in the other category represented and of revenues in and  respectively 
we continue to have a diversified portfolio of products with no single product representing more than of total revenue 
cost of revenue for the year ended december   our cost of revenue was million  or of total revenue  which represented an increase of million from million  or of total revenue  in the increase in the cost of revenue during was primarily attributable to the increasing in volume of products sold 
gross profit and gross margin gross profit for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million  or  from million in our gross profit margin in was  compared to in the healthcare reform instituted by the chinese government since has resulted in margin compression in most pharmaceutical products on the markets today  especially in the generic space that many of our products are in 
while some of our higher margin products are still selling very well  most of our products experienced gross margins degradation compared to a year ago 
going forward we expect to see continued pricing pressure in most products  but new products such as candesartan and rosuvastatin could help to support overall gross margin once they are launched 
selling expenses our selling expenses for the year ended december  were million  an increase of approximately million  compared to million in selling expenses accounted for of the total revenue in compared to in our overall selling expense to revenue ratio is still stable at between to level 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  an increase of approximately million  or  compared to million in general and administrative expenses accounting for and of our total revenues in and  respectively 
the increase was in part due to higher professional fees in compared to and a number of one time charges 
bad debt expenses benefit due to the peculiarity of the chinese pharmaceutical market environment  deferred payments to pharmaceutical companies by state owned hospitals and local medicine distributors are a normal phenomenon 
over of our drugs are sold to state owned hospitals and local medicine distributors  which creates slow collections of our trade receivables 
since the majority of hospitals in china are backed by the government  management believes that the deferred payments from state owned hospitals are secure and will eventually be collected 
so far  we have not written off any receivables in our year history of doing business with hospitals 
in general  our normal credit or payments terms extended to customers is days 
this has not changed in recent years 
our customers are pharmaceutical distributors who sell to mostly government backed hospitals 
since hospital pharmacies in china typically take a very long time to pay for their pharmaceutical products  the age of our receivables from our customers tends to be long as well 
although these customers typically pay after the due date of the receivables  we have always been able to collect our receivables and have never had an uncollectible receivable from these customers 
the amount of accounts receivable that were past due or the amount of accounts receivable that were more than days old was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the following table illustrates our accounts receivable aging distribution in terms of percentage of total accounts receivable as of december  and december  december  days days days days total although we have not had to write off any receivables thus far in our company s history  we do set aside an allowance for doubtful accounts 
our bad debt allowance estimate is currently the sum of of accounts receivable that are less than days old  of accounts receivable that are between days and days old and of accounts receivable that are greater than days old although there were no accounts receivable over days old at december  or to the extent that our current allowance for doubtful accounts is higher than that of the previous period  we recognize a bad debt expense for the difference during the current period  and when the current allowance is lower than that of the previous period  we recognize a bad debt benefit for the difference 
the changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts during the years ended december  and were as follows there were no write offs or recoveries for the twelve months ended december  balance  beginning of year bad debt expense benefit foreign currency translation adjustment balance  end of year income from operations our operating income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million in  a decrease of million 
the main reasons for the decrease were lower gross profits and higher selling expenses in net interest income expense net interest expense for the year ended december  was  compared to  in  an increase of  derivative gains losses changes to derivative warrant liability are recognized in the results of operations and resulted in a derivative gain of  during the year ended december  and  during the year ended december  please see note to our consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
income tax expense in the year ended december   we paid income tax at the rate of 
income tax expense for the year ended december  was million 
in the year ended december   we paid income tax at the rate of and we paid million in taxes for the year ended december  we obtained the national high tech enterprise status national ht status from the prc government in the fourth quarter of with this designation  we are entitled to a preferential tax rate of for the years ending december   and  which is notably lower than the statutory income tax rate of 
net income net income for year ended december  was million  a decrease of  from million in the year ended december  the decrease in net income was mainly due to the decrease in gross profit margin  increase in income tax rate  and increase in selling expenses 
for the year ended december   earnings per basic common share was per share  compared to in the year ended december  the number of basic weighted average outstanding shares used to calculate earnings per share were  for and  for for the year ended december   diluted earnings per common share was per share  compared to in in the year ended december the number of diluted weighted average outstanding shares used to calculate earnings per share were  for and  for liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations and short term bank loans 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents outstanding was million  which represents of our total assets  an increase of approximately million from million as of december  of the million of cash and cash equivalents and banker s acceptances at december   a total of million is considered to be reinvested indefinitely in helpson and is not expected to be available for payment of dividends  for other payments to our parent company or to its shareholders 
as of december   we had a principal balance of million in short term bank loans 
the cash flow generated from operating activities funded the new purchases of our intangible assets drug formulas 
during  we continued our vigorous collection efforts from our customers and achieved good results 
while we have made progress  improving our accounts receivable collection continues to be a focus of our management team and we expect to make further progress in the quarters to come 
at december   the company was obligated to pay laboratories million upon their completion of the various phases of contracts to provide sfda production approval of more than medical formulas 
those payments are expected to be made out of the company s cash flow from operations ratably over approximately the following months  depending on the progress of the various contracts 
a typical contract requires an upfront deposit and then two to three additional milestone payments plus a final payment when the sfda approval is obtained 
since the payments are progress driven  it is difficult to calculate the timing of the payments with any precision  however  management expects that the payments will be somewhat even over the payment period given the number of contracts in progress 
the funding obligation is not expected to have an undue negative impact on the liquidity of the company given the company s historical cash flows and estimated future cash flows from operating activities 
based on our current operating plan  management believes that our cash provided by operations plus the proceeds from our existing bank loans will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs and our anticipated capital expenditures  including expenditures for new formula acquisitions  for the next twelve months 
however  if events or circumstances occur and we do not meet our operating plan as expected  we may be required to seek additional capital and or to reduce certain discretionary spending  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our business objectives 
notwithstanding the foregoing  we may seek additional financing as necessary for expansion purposes and when we believe market conditions are most advantageous  which may include debt and or equity financing 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all

for fiscal  million was used to fund increases in account receivables  compared to million for this category in the comparable period a year ago 
as a common business practice in china  banker s acceptances bas are often used to settle receivables and to make purchases instead of checks 
during the twelve months period ended december   the company received payment with bas with a maturity of more than days  and such bas are not treated as cash and cash equivalent under us gaap 
if cash equivalent treatment were to be applied to bas with more than days maturity  million would have been used to fund increases in account receivables 
please see the discussion of the reconciliation with gaap figures in a table below 
at december   total inventory was million  an increase of million from million at december  most of the inventory increase in was due to increased purchase of raw material inventory while the inventory increase in was due to a temporary rise in finished goods 
cash usage on inventories for the twelve months period ended december  was million as compared to million in the comparable period for as mentioned in the above  we often use bas to settle receivables and to make purchases 
during the year ended december   the company used bas with a maturity of more than days to pay for raw materials  and such bas are not treated as cash and cash equivalent under us gaap 
if cash equivalent treatment were to be applied to bas with more than days maturity  million would have been used to fund increases in inventory 
please see the discussion of reconciliation with gaap figures below 
for the period ending december   the decrease in our accounts payable was responsible for a cash usage of million in the first half of while in the same period in an increase in accounts payable resulted in cash addition of million

according to relevant prc laws  companies registered in the prc  including our prc subsidiary  helpson  are required to allocate at least ten percent of their after tax net income  as determined under accounting standards and regulations in the prc  to statutory surplus reserve accounts until the reserve account balances reach fifty percent of the companies registered capital prior to their remittance of funds out of the prc 
allocations to these reserves and funds can only be used for specific purposes and are not transferrable to the parent company in the form of loans  advances or cash dividends 
as of december  and  the net assets of helpson were  and  respectively 
due to the restriction on dividend distribution to overseas shareholders  the amount of helpson s net assets that were designated for general and statutory capital reserves  and thus could not be transferred to our parent company as cash dividends  were  and  of registered capital for the fiscal years ended december  and since the amount that helpson must set aside for the statutory surplus fund only accounts for and  respectively  of its total net assets  this reserve does not have a major impact on our liquidity 
the prc government also imposes controls on the conversion of rmb into foreign currencies and the remittance of currencies out of the prc 
our businesses and assets are primarily denominated in rmb 
all foreign exchange transactions take place either through the people s bank of china or other banks authorized to buy and sell foreign currencies at the exchange rates quoted by the people s bank of china 
approval of foreign currency payments by the people s bank of china or other regulatory institutions requires submitting a payment application form together with applicable invoices and signed contracts 
these currency exchange control procedures imposed by the prc government authorities may restrict the ability of helpson  our prc subsidiary  to transfer its net assets to our parent company through loans  advances or cash dividends 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
commitments as of december   we had no material commitments except for those expenditures incurred in the ordinary course of business
