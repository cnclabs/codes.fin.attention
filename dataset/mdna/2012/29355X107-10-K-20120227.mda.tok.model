price  delivery time  engineering and service support  and engine efficiency relating to fuel consumption and emissions drive competition 
raw materials and components 
our engine products and services segment purchases multiple ferrous and non ferrous castings  forgings  plate stock and bar stock for fabrication and machining into engines 
in addition  we buy a considerable amount of precision machined engine components 
we believe all of these raw materials and components are readily available from various suppliers  but may be subject to long and variable lead times 
research and development the goal of our research and development effort is to strengthen our product portfolios for traditional markets while simultaneously creating distinctive and breakthrough products 
we utilize a process to move product innovations from concept to commercialization  and to identify  analyze  develop and implement new product concepts and opportunities aimed at business growth 

table of contents we employ scientists  engineers and technicians throughout our operations to develop  design and test new and improved products 
we work closely with our customers to identify issues and develop technical solutions 
the majority of our research and development spending typically is directed toward the development of new sealing products for the most demanding environments  the development of truck and trailer fleet information systems  and the development of bearing products and materials with increased load carrying capability and superior friction and wear characteristics 
backlog at december   we had a backlog of orders valued at million compared with million at december  approximately of the backlog  almost exclusively at fairbanks morse engine  is expected to be filled beyond backlog represents orders on hand we believe to be firm 
however  there is no certainty the backlog orders will result in actual sales at the times or in the amounts ordered 
in addition  for most of our business  backlog is not particularly predictive of future performance because of our short lead times and some seasonality 
quality assurance we believe product quality is among the most important factors in developing and maintaining strong  long term relationships with our customers 
in order to meet the exacting requirements of our customers  we maintain stringent standards of quality control 
we routinely employ in process inspection by using testing equipment as a process aid during all stages of development  design and production to ensure product quality and reliability 
these include state of the art cad cam equipment  statistical process control systems  laser tracking devices  failure mode and effect analysis  and coordinate measuring machines 
we are able to extract numerical quality control data as a statistical measurement of the quality of the parts being manufactured from our cnc machinery 
in addition  we perform quality control tests on parts that we outsource 
as a result  we are able to significantly reduce the number of defective parts and therefore improve efficiency  quality and reliability 
as of december   of our manufacturing facilities were iso  qs and or ts certified 
sixteen of our facilities are iso certified 
oems are increasingly requiring these standards in lieu of individual certification procedures  and as a condition of awarding business 
patents  trademarks and other intellectual property we maintain a number of patents and trademarks issued by the us and other countries relating to the name and design of our products and have granted licenses to some of these trademarks and patents 
we routinely evaluate the need to protect new and existing products through the patent and trademark systems in the us and other countries 
we also have unpatented proprietary information  consisting of know how and trade secrets relating to the design  manufacture and operation of our products and their use 
we do not consider our business as a whole to be materially dependent on any particular patent  patent right  trademark  trade secret or license granted or group of related patents  patent rights  trademarks  trade secrets or licenses granted 
in general  we are the owner of the rights to the products that we manufacture and sell 
however  we also license patented and other proprietary technology and processes from various companies and individuals in order to broaden our product offerings 
we are dependent on the ability of these third parties to diligently protect their intellectual property rights 
in several cases  the intellectual property licenses are integral to the manufacture of our products 
for example  fairbanks morse engine licenses 
table of contents technology from man diesel and its subsidiaries for the four stroke reciprocating engine it produces  which licenses generally expire and are terminated on the date five years after a party gives notice of termination 
a loss of these licenses or a failure on the part of the third party to protect its own intellectual property could reduce our revenues 
although these licenses are long term and subject to renewal  it is possible we may not successfully renegotiate these licenses or they could be terminated for a material breach 
if this were to occur  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 
employees and labor relations we currently have approximately  employees worldwide in our continuing operations 
approximately  employees are located within the us  and approximately  employees are located outside the us  primarily in europe  canada and mexico 
approximately of our us employees are members of trade unions covered by two collective bargaining agreements with contract termination dates in august to december union agreements relate  among other things  to wages  hours  and conditions of employment 
the wages and benefits furnished are generally comparable to industry and area practices 
our deconsolidated subsidiaries  primarily gst llc  have about  additional employees worldwide 
item a 
risk factors in addition to the risks stated elsewhere in this annual report  set forth below are certain risk factors that we believe are material 
if any of these risks occur  our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and reputation could be harmed 
you should also consider these risk factors when you read forward looking statements elsewhere in this report 
you can identify forward looking statements by terms such as may  hope  will  could  should  expect  plan  anticipate  intend  believe  estimate  predict  potential or continue  the negative of those terms or other comparable terms 
those forward looking statements are only predictions and can be adversely affected if any of these risks occur 
risks related to our business certain of our subsidiaries filed petitions to resolve asbestos litigation 
the historical business operations of certain subsidiaries of our subsidiary  coltec industries inc coltec  principally gst llc and the anchor packing company anchor  have resulted in a substantial volume of asbestos litigation in which plaintiffs have alleged personal injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos fibers 
those subsidiaries manufactured and or sold industrial sealing products  predominately gaskets and packing products  which contained encapsulated asbestos fibers 
anchor is an inactive and insolvent indirect subsidiary of coltec 
there is no remaining insurance coverage available to anchor and it has no assets 
our subsidiaries exposure to asbestos litigation and their relationships with insurance carriers has been actively managed through another coltec subsidiary  garrison litigation management group  ltd 
garrison 
on the petition date  gst llc  anchor and garrison filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code in the us bankruptcy court for the western district of north carolina in charlotte to address these claims 
these subsidiaries have been deconsolidated from our financial statements since the petition date 
the amount that will be necessary to fully and finally resolve the asbestos liabilities of these companies is uncertain 
several risks and uncertainties result from these filings that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
those risks and uncertainties include the following the value of the deconsolidated subsidiaries reflected in our financial statements  
table of contents the uncertainty of the number and per claim value of pending and potential future asbestos claims  the financial viability of our subsidiaries insurance carriers and their reinsurance carriers  and our subsidiaries ability to collect on claims from them  the potential for asbestos exposure to extend beyond the filed entities arising from corporate veil piercing efforts or other claims by asbestos plaintiffs  and the costs of the bankruptcy proceeding and the length of time necessary to resolve the case  either through settlement or various court proceedings 
for a further discussion of the filings and our asbestos exposure  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and outlook  contingencies asbestos and contingencies subsidiary bankruptcy  and notes and to our consolidated financial statements  included in this report 
our business and some of the markets we serve are cyclical and distressed market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the markets in which we sell our products  particularly chemical companies  petroleum refineries  heavy duty trucking  semiconductor manufacturing  capital equipment and the automotive industry  are  to varying degrees  cyclical and have historically experienced periodic downturns 
prior downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand  excess manufacturing capacity and subsequent erosion of average selling prices in these markets resulting in negative effects on our net sales  gross margins and net income 
the recent recession affected our results of operations 
a prolonged and severe downward cycle in our markets could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we face intense competition that could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we encounter intense competition in almost all areas of our businesses 
customers for many of our products are attempting to reduce the number of vendors from which they purchase in order to reduce inventories 
to remain competitive  we need to invest continuously in manufacturing  marketing  customer service and support and our distribution networks 
we also need to develop new products to continue to meet the needs and desires of our customers 
we may not have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments or maintain our competitive position 
additionally  some of our competitors are larger than we are and have substantially greater financial resources than we do 
as a result  they may be better able to withstand the effects of periodic economic downturns 
certain of our products may also experience transformation from unique branded products to undifferentiated price sensitive products 
this product commoditization may be accelerated by low cost foreign competition 
changes in the replacement cycle of certain of our products  including because of improved product quality or improved maintenance  may affect aftermarket demand for such products 
initiatives designed to distinguish our products through superior service  continuous improvement  innovation  customer relationships  technology  new product acquisitions  bundling with key services  long term contracts or market focus may not be effective 
pricing and other competitive pressures could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents if we fail to retain the independent agents and distributors upon whom we rely to market our products  we may be unable to effectively market our products and our revenue and profitability may decline 
our marketing success in the us and abroad depends largely upon our independent agents and distributors sales and service expertise and relationships with customers in our markets 
many of these agents have developed strong ties to existing and potential customers because of their detailed knowledge of our products 
a loss of a significant number of these agents or distributors  or of a particular agent or distributor in a key market or with key customer relationships  could significantly inhibit our ability to effectively market our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
increased costs for raw materials  the termination of existing supply agreements or disruptions of our supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the prices for some of the raw materials we purchase increased in while we have been successful in passing along some or all of these higher costs  there can be no assurance we will be able to continue doing so without losing customers 
similarly  the loss of a key supplier or the unavailability of a key raw material could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we have exposure to some contingent liabilities relating to discontinued operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows in any fiscal period 
we have contingent liabilities related to discontinued operations of our predecessors  including environmental liabilities and liabilities for certain products and other matters 
in some instances we have indemnified others against those liabilities  and in other instances we have received indemnities from third parties against those liabilities 
claims could arise relating to products or other matters related to our discontinued operations 
some of these claims could seek substantial monetary damages 
for example  we could potentially be subject to the liabilities related to the firearms manufactured prior to march by colt firearms  a former operation of coltec  and for electrical transformers manufactured prior to may by central moloney  another former coltec operation 
coltec has ongoing obligations with regard to workers compensation  retiree medical and other retiree benefit matters associated with discontinued operations in connection with coltec s periods of ownership of those operations 
we have insurance  reserves  and funds held in trust to address these liabilities 
however  if our insurance coverage is depleted  our reserves are not adequate  or the funds held in trust are insufficient  environmental and other liabilities relating to discontinued operations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we conduct a significant amount of our sales activities outside of the us  which subjects us to additional business risks that may cause our profitability to decline 
because we sell our products in a number of foreign countries  we are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally 
in  we derived approximately of our revenues from sales of our products outside of the us our international operations are  and will continue to be  subject to a number of risks  including unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  
table of contents adverse changes in foreign tax  legal and regulatory requirements  difficulty in protecting intellectual property  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  cultural norms and expectations that may sometimes be inconsistent with our code of conduct and our requirements about the manner in which our employees  agents and distributors conduct business  differing labor regulations  political and economic instability  and acts of hostility  terror or war 
any of these factors  individually or together  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our operations outside the united states require us to comply with a number of united states and international regulations 
for example  our operations in countries outside the united states are subject to the foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa  which prohibits united states companies or their agents and employees from providing anything of value to a foreign official for the purposes of influencing any act or decision of these individuals in their official capacity to help obtain or retain business  direct business to any person or corporate entity  or obtain any unfair advantage 
our activities in countries outside the united states create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees or agents that could be in violation of the fcpa  even though these parties are not always subject to our control 
we have internal control policies and procedures and have implemented training and compliance programs with respect to the fcpa 
however  we cannot assure that our policies  procedures and programs always will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents 
in the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees or agents have or may have violated applicable anti corruption laws  including the fcpa  we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances 
violations of the fcpa may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions  and we may be subject to other liabilities  which could negatively affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
we intend to continue to pursue international growth opportunities  which could increase our exposure to risks associated with international sales and operations 
as we expand our international operations  we may also encounter new risks that could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
for example  as we focus on building our international sales and distribution networks in new geographic regions  we must continue to develop relationships with qualified local agents  distributors and trading companies 
if we are not successful in developing these relationships  we may not be able to increase sales in these regions 
failure to properly manage these risks could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights and knowledge relating to our products  our business and prospects may be negatively impacted 
we believe that proprietary products and technology are important to our success 
if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property and know how  our business and prospects could be 
table of contents negatively impacted 
our efforts to protect our intellectual property through patents  trademarks  service marks  domain names  trade secrets  copyrights  confidentiality  non compete and nondisclosure agreements and other measures may not be adequate to protect our proprietary rights 
patents issued to third parties  whether before or after the issue date of our patents  could render our intellectual property less valuable 
questions as to whether our competitors products infringe our intellectual property rights or whether our products infringe our competitors intellectual property rights may be disputed 
in addition  intellectual property rights may be unavailable  limited or difficult to enforce in some jurisdictions  which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share in those jurisdictions 
our competitors may capture market share from us by selling products that claim to mirror the capabilities of our products or technology 
without sufficient protection nationally and internationally for our intellectual property  our competitiveness worldwide could be impaired  which would negatively impact our growth and future revenue 
as a result  we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights 
we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions  which could involve certain risks and uncertainties 
we expect to continue to make acquisitions in the future 
acquisitions involve numerous inherent challenges  such as properly evaluating acquisition opportunities  properly evaluating risks and other diligence matters  ensuring adequate capital availability and balancing other resource constraints 
there are risks and uncertainties related to acquisitions  including difficulties integrating acquired technology  operations  personnel and financial and other systems  unrealized sales expectations from the acquired business  unrealized synergies and cost savings  unknown or underestimated liabilities  diversion of management attention from running our existing businesses and potential loss of key management employees of the acquired business 
in addition  internal controls over financial reporting of acquired companies may not be up to required standards 
our integration activities may place substantial demands on our management  operational resources and financial and internal control systems 
customer dissatisfaction or performance problems with an acquired business  technology  service or product could also have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business 
our business could be materially adversely affected by numerous other risks  including rising healthcare costs  changes in environmental laws and unforeseen business interruptions 
our business may be negatively impacted by numerous other risks 
for example  medical and healthcare costs may continue to increase 
initiatives to address these costs  such as consumer driven health plan packages  may not successfully reduce these expenses as needed 
failure to offer competitive employee benefits may result in our inability to recruit or maintain key employees 
other risks to our business include potential changes in environmental rules or regulations  which could negatively impact our manufacturing processes 
use of certain chemicals and other substances could become restricted or such changes may otherwise require us to incur additional costs which could reduce our profitability and impair our ability to offer competitively priced products 
additional risks to our business include global or local events which could significantly disrupt our operations 
terrorist attacks  natural disasters  political insurgencies  pandemics  information system failures and electrical grid disruptions and outages are some of the unforeseen risks that could negatively affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents risks related to ownership of our common stock the market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile 
a relatively small number of shares traded in any one day could have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock 
the market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for many reasons  including in response to the risks described in this section and elsewhere in this report or for reasons unrelated to our operations  such as reports by industry analysts  investor perceptions or negative announcements by our customers  competitors or suppliers regarding their own performance  as well as industry conditions and general financial  economic and political instability 
because our quarterly revenues and operating results may vary significantly in future periods  our stock price may fluctuate 
our revenue and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
a high proportion of our costs are fixed  due in part to significant selling and manufacturing costs 
small declines in revenues could disproportionately affect operating results in a quarter and the price of our common stock may fall 
we may also incur charges to income to cover increases in the estimate of our subsidiaries future asbestos liability 
other factors that could affect quarterly operating results include  but are not limited to demand for our products  the timing and execution of customer contracts  the timing of sales of our products  increases in manufacturing costs due to equipment or labor issues  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in applicable tax rates  an impairment in the value of our investment in gst  unanticipated delays or problems in introducing new products  announcements by competitors of new products  services or technological innovations  changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors  increased expenses  whether related to sales and marketing  raw materials or supplies  product development or administration  major changes in the level of economic activity in major regions of the world in which we do business  costs related to possible future acquisitions or divestitures of technologies or businesses  an increase in the number or magnitude of product liability claims  
table of contents our ability to expand our operations and the amount and timing of expenditures related to expansion of our operations  particularly outside the us  and economic assumptions and market factors used to determine post retirement benefits and pension liabilities 
various provisions and laws could delay or prevent a change of control 
the anti takeover provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws  our shareholder rights plan and provisions of north carolina law could delay or prevent a change of control or may impede the ability of the holders of our common stock to change our management 
in particular  our articles of incorporation and bylaws  among other things require a supermajority shareholder vote to approve any business combination transaction with an owner of or more of our shares unless the transaction is recommended by disinterested directors  limit the right of shareholders to remove directors and fill vacancies  regulate how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholders meetings  and authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series  without shareholder approval 
our shareholder rights plan also makes an acquisition of a controlling interest in enpro in a transaction not approved by our board of directors more difficult 
future sales of our common stock in the public market could lower the market price for our common stock and adversely impact the trading price of our convertible debentures 
in the future  we may sell additional shares of our common stock to raise capital 
in addition  a reasonable number of shares of our common stock are reserved for issuance under our equity compensation plans  including shares to be issued upon the exercise of stock options  vesting of restricted stock or unit grants  and upon conversion of our convertible debentures 
we cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect  if any  that they may have on the market price for our common stock 
the issuance and sales of substantial amounts of common stock  or the perception that such issuances and sales may occur  could adversely affect the trading price of the debentures and the market price of our common stock 
absence of dividends could reduce our attractiveness to investors 
we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock 
moreover  our current senior secured credit facility restricts our ability to pay cash dividends on common stock if availability under the facility falls below million 
as a result  our common stock may be less attractive to certain investors than the stock of companies with a history of paying regular dividends 
risks related to our capital structure our debt agreement imposes limitations on our operations  which could impede our ability to respond to market conditions  address unanticipated capital investments and or pursue business opportunities 

table of contents we have a senior secured revolving credit facility that imposes limitations on our operations  such as limitations on distributions  limitations on incurrence and repayment of indebtedness  and maintenance of a fixed charge coverage financial ratio if average monthly availability is less than certain thresholds 
these limitations could impede our ability to respond to market conditions  address unanticipated capital investment needs and or pursue business opportunities 
we may not have sufficient cash to fund amounts payable upon a conversion of our convertible debentures or to repurchase the debentures at the option of the holder upon a change of control 
our convertible debentures mature on october  the debentures are subject to conversion when one or more of the conversion conditions specified in the indenture governing the debentures are satisfied 
upon a conversion  we will be required to make a cash payment of up to  for each  in principal amount of debentures converted 
one of these conversion conditions is based on the trading price of our common stock 
the debentures become subject to conversion in the succeeding quarter  upon notice by the holders  when the closing price per share of our common stock exceeds  or of the conversion price of  for at least twenty trading days during the last thirty consecutive trading days of any calendar quarter such amounts are subject to adjustment for specified events as set forth in the indenture 
none of the conversion conditions were satisfied at december   but this particular condition was in effect for the quarter ended september  in addition  upon a change of control  subject to certain conditions  we will be required to make an offer to repurchase for cash all outstanding convertible debentures at of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest  including liquidated damages  if any  up to but not including the date of repurchase 
however  we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to settle converted debentures or make repurchases of tendered debentures 
any credit facility in place at the time of a repurchase or conversion of the debentures may also limit our ability to use borrowings to pay any cash payable on a repurchase or conversion of the debentures and may prohibit us from making any cash payments on the repurchase or conversion of the debentures if a default or event of default has occurred under that facility without the consent of the lenders under that credit facility 
our current million senior secured credit facility prohibits distributions from our subsidiaries to us to make payments of principal or interest on the debentures or payments upon conversion of the debentures and prohibits prepayments of the debentures  in each case if a default or event of default exists or if our subsidiaries identified as borrowers under the facility fail to have either a pro forma average borrowing availability under the facility greater than the greater of i the lesser of of a the available borrowing base or b the aggregate commitments of the lenders under the credit facility or ii million or b i pro forma average borrowing availability under the facility greater than the greater of a the lesser of of i the available borrowing base or ii the aggregate commitments of the lenders under the credit facility or b million  and ii a pro forma fixed charge coverage ratio that is greater than to our failure to repurchase tendered debentures at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture or to pay any cash payable on a conversion of the debentures would constitute a default under the indenture 
a default under the indenture or the change of control itself could lead to a default under the other existing and future agreements governing our indebtedness 
if the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods  we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the debentures or make cash payments upon conversion thereof 
derivative transactions may expose us to unexpected risk and potential losses 
we are party to certain derivative transactions  such as foreign exchange contracts and call options hedge and warrant transactions with respect to our convertible debentures  with financial institutions to hedge against certain financial risks 
in light of current economic uncertainty and potential for financial institution failures  we may be exposed to the risk that our counterparty in a derivative transaction may be unable to perform its obligations as a result of being placed in receivership or 
table of contents otherwise 
in the event a counterparty to a material derivative transaction is unable to perform its obligations thereunder  we may experience losses material to our results of operations and financial condition

overview and outlook overview 
we design  develop  manufacture  service and market proprietary engineered industrial products 
we have primary manufacturing facilities located in countries  including the united states 
we manage our business as three segments a sealing products segment  an engineered products segment  and an engine products and services segment 
our sealing products segment designs  manufactures and sells sealing products  including metallic  non metallic and composite material gaskets  dynamic seals  compression packing  resilient metal seals  elastomeric seals  hydraulic components  expansion joints  heavy duty truck wheel end component systems  including brake products  flange sealing and isolation products  pipeline casing spacers isolators  casing end seals  modular sealing systems for sealing pipeline penetrations  hole forming products  manhole infiltration sealing systems  safety related signage for pipelines  bellows and bellows assemblies  pedestals for semiconductor manufacturing  ptfe products  conveyor belting  and sheeted rubber products 
these products are used in a variety of industries  including chemical and petrochemical processing  petroleum extraction and refining  pulp and paper processing  heavy duty 
table of contents trucking  power generation  food and pharmaceutical processing  primary metal manufacturing  mining  water and waste treatment  aerospace  medical  filtration and semiconductor fabrication 
in many of these industries  performance and durability are vital for safety and environmental protection 
many of our products are used in applications that are highly demanding  eg  where extreme temperatures  extreme pressures  corrosive environments  strict tolerances  and or worn equipment make product performance difficult 
our engineered products segment includes operations that design  manufacture and sell self lubricating  non rolling  metal polymer  solid polymer and filament wound bearing products  aluminum blocks for hydraulic applications and precision engineered components and lubrication systems for reciprocating compressors 
these products are used in a wide range of applications  including the automotive  pharmaceutical  pulp and paper  natural gas  health  power generation  machine tools  air treatment  refining  petrochemical and general industrial markets

the historical business operations of certain subsidiaries of our subsidiary  coltec industries inc coltec  principally garlock sealing technologies llc gst llc and the anchor packing company anchor  have resulted in a substantial volume of asbestos litigation in which plaintiffs have alleged personal injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos fibers 
information about gst llc s asbestos litigation is contained in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the asbestos subsection of the contingencies section 
on june  the petition date  gst llc  anchor and garrison litigation management group  ltd 
garrison filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code in the us bankruptcy court for the western district of north carolina in charlotte the bankruptcy court 
gst llc  anchor and garrison are sometimes referred to collectively as gst in this report 
the filings were the initial step in a claims resolution process 
gst llc is one of the businesses in our broader garlock group 
gst llc and its subsidiaries operate five significant manufacturing facilities  including operations in palmyra  new york and houston  texas 
the filings did not include enpro industries  inc  or any other enpro industries  inc operating subsidiary 
gst llc now operates in the ordinary course under court protection from asbestos claims 
all pending litigation against gst is stayed during the process 
we address our actions to permanently resolve gst llc s asbestos litigation in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the garlock sealing technologies llc and garrison litigation management group  ltd 
section 
the financial results of gst and subsidiaries are included in our consolidated results through june   the day prior to the petition date 
however  us generally accepted accounting principles require an entity that files for protection under the us bankruptcy code  whether solvent or insolvent  whose financial statements were previously consolidated with those of its parent  as gst s and its subsidiaries were with ours  generally must be prospectively deconsolidated from the parent and the investment accounted for using the cost method 
at deconsolidation  our investment was recorded at its estimated fair value as of june   resulting in a gain for reporting purposes 
the cost method requires us to present our ownership interests in the net assets of gst at the petition date as an investment and not recognize any income or loss from gst and subsidiaries in our results of operations during the reorganization period 
our investment of million as of december  and  was subject to periodic reviews for impairment 
when gst emerges from the jurisdiction of the 
table of contents bankruptcy court  the subsequent accounting will be determined based upon the applicable facts and circumstances at such time  including the terms of any plan of reorganization 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for condensed financial information of gst and subsidiaries 
during   and  we completed a number of acquisitions and a disposition of a business 
please refer to acquisitions and dispositions in item business for additional discussion regarding these transactions 
during the first quarter of  we concluded events had occurred and circumstances had changed which required us to perform an interim period goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units  including ggb in the engineered products segment and plastomer technologies in the sealing products segment  both of which had experienced reduced volumes as a result of deterioration in the global economic environment 
we performed a preliminary analysis and determined it was necessary to conduct an impairment test for ggb and plastomer technologies 
during the second quarter of  we conducted an analysis to compare the fair value of ggb and plastomer technologies to the respective carrying values assigned to their net assets 
the excess of the fair value of each reporting unit over the carrying value assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of its goodwill 
to estimate the fair value  we used discounted cash flow and market valuation approaches 
the discounted cash flow approach uses cash flow projections to calculate the fair value of each reporting unit while the market approach relies on market multiples of similar companies 
the key assumptions used for the discounted cash flow approach include business projections  growth rates  and discount rates 
the discount rate we used was based on our weighted average cost of capital 
for the market approach  we chose a group of companies we believed to be representative of our diversified industrial and automotive peers 
based on the results of the test  we determined the fair values of ggb and plastomer technologies were less than the carrying values of their net assets  resulting in an implied fair value of goodwill of zero for both ggb and plastomer technologies 
as a result  in the second quarter of  we recognized an impairment charge of million before tax  which represented all of the remaining goodwill in these reporting units 
during the analysis  we also tested the fair value of our other reporting units and determined there was no goodwill impairment for the other reporting units 
we completed our required annual impairment test of goodwill for our reporting units as of october   and the results did not indicate impairment of the remaining goodwill 
based on the results of the test  we determined the fair value of one of the reporting units exceeded its carrying value by approximately and the other reporting units having goodwill balances had fair values in excess of their carrying values by over 
outlook in  we currently anticipate strong sales growth as our operations benefit from improved market conditions  higher volumes  market share gains  and a full year of sales from businesses acquired in we also expect segment profit margins to improve over  although margins will continue to reflect increased sales of lower margin products as we expand in original equipment markets  and costs associated with the integration of the businesses acquired in  especially in the first half of our effective tax rate is directly affected by the relative proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
based on the expected mix of domestic and foreign earnings  we anticipate our effective tax rate for will be between and  which is lower than the us statutory rate primarily due to the earnings in lower rate foreign jurisdictions 
in the us  we benefit from certain tax incentives such as the deduction for domestic production activities  and credits for research and development 
discrete tax events may cause our effective rate to fluctuate on a quarterly 
table of contents basis 
certain events  including  for example  acquisitions and other business changes  which are difficult to predict  may also cause our effective tax rate to fluctuate 
we are subject to changing tax laws  regulations  and interpretations in multiple jurisdictions 
corporate tax reform continues to be a priority in the us and other jurisdictions 
changes to the tax system in the us could have significant effects  positive and negative  on our effective tax rate  and on our deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in june  the us internal revenue service irs began an examination of our and us federal income tax returns 
in february  the irs notified us it also will examine our us federal income tax return 
although these examinations are part of a routine and recurring cycle we have experienced previously  we cannot predict the final outcome or expected conclusion date of the audits 
various foreign and state tax returns also are under examination and some of these exams may conclude within the next twelve months 
the final outcomes of these audits are not yet determinable  however  we believe assessments that may arise will not have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
there are other returns not under examination for which it is possible the statute of limitations for assessments will expire in the next twelve months 
because we provide for uncertain tax positions  expiration of the period for assessments may have a favorable effect on our effective tax rate 
our us defined benefit plans continue to be underfunded 
based on currently available data  which is subject to change  we estimate we will be required to make contributions to the us defined benefit plans in totaling approximately million 
we expect contributions to non us defined benefit plans to be insignificant 
additional significant cash contributions to the us defined benefit plans are likely to be required in and beyond 
future contribution requirements depend on pension asset returns  pension valuation assumptions  plan design  and legislative actions 
we estimate annual pension expense in will be million  which is million more than in the increase in pension expense is primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate used in the actuarial computations 
in connection with our growth strategy  we will continue to evaluate acquisitions in  however  the effect of such acquisitions cannot be predicted and therefore is not reflected in this outlook 
since completing the sale of the quincy compressor business  we have completed several acquisitions and redeployed the cash received in connection with the sale 
we anticipate our rate of growth through acquisitions may moderate if our access to additional capital resources declines 
we address our outlook on our actions to permanently resolve gst llc s asbestos litigation in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations garlock sealing technologies llc and garrison litigation management group  ltd 
section 
results of operations the following table does not include results for gst and subsidiaries in the sealing products segment after the day preceding the petition date 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in this form k for condensed financial information for gst and subsidiaries 

table of contents years ended december  in millions sales sealing products engineered products engine products and services intersegment sales total sales segment profit loss sealing products engineered products engine products and services total segment profit corporate expenses goodwill impairment charge interest expense  net asbestos related expenses other income expense  net income loss from continuing operations before income taxes segment profit is total segment revenue reduced by operating  restructuring and other expenses identifiable with the segment 
corporate expenses include general corporate administrative costs 
expenses not directly attributable to the segments  corporate expenses  net interest expense  asbestos related expenses  gains losses or impairments related to the sale of assets  and income taxes are not included in the computation of segment profit 
the accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those for enpro 
compared to sales of  million in increased from million in sales from acquisitions completed since contributed about percentage points to the increase 
in addition  sales increased as a result of higher volumes in the sealing products and engineered products segments as we have taken advantage of improvements in nearly all of our customer markets and we are actively pursuing increased market share 
selected price increases we have instituted also contributed to the increase in sales compared to last year 
sales in the engine products and services segment grew primarily due to shipping more engines  with higher average revenue per engine  in versus  and incremental revenue related to using the percentage of completion accounting method beginning in the third quarter of changes in foreign exchange rates added two percentage points to the sales increase

segment profit for gst llc in through the petition date was million 
the improvements in the sealing products and engineered products segments were partially offset by the decline in earnings in the engine products and services segment caused by lower margins on the higher engine shipments  a decrease in higher margin parts and services revenue  and provisions for a warranty matter and an anticipated contract loss 
segment operating margins also softened due to the inclusion of the lower margin acquired businesses  which continue to work through the integration process 
changes in foreign exchange rates added two percentage points to the segment profit increase 
as a result of these changes  segment margins  defined as segment profit divided by sales  declined from in to in excluding the engine parts and services segment  segment margins declined only slightly from in to in corporate expenses for declined by million compared to primarily due to lower medical expenses  directors share based compensation  and consulting expenses partially offset by higher salary and management s incentive compensation expenses 
net interest expense in was million compared to million in the increase in net interest expense was caused primarily by the deconsolidation of gst and the inclusion of interest expense on notes payable to gst llc in our results  which previously was eliminated in our consolidated results

in connection with the deconsolidation of gst  we recorded a pre tax gain of million in the gain is discussed in the garlock sealing technologies llc and garrison litigation management group  ltd 
section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we recorded an income tax expense of million on pre tax income from continuing operations of million in  resulting in an effective tax rate of 
our effective tax rate continues to be lower than the us statutory rates primarily due to the earnings in lower rate foreign jurisdictions 
in the us  we also benefit from certain tax incentives such as the deduction for domestic production activities and credits for research and development 
during  our effective tax rate was as we recorded an income tax expense of million on pre tax income from continuing operations of million 
the income tax expense in was favorably affected by the restructuring of part of our ggb operation in europe  as well as the overall jurisdictional mix of earnings 
income from continuing operations was million  or per share  in compared to million  or per share  in earnings per share are expressed on a diluted basis

following is a discussion of operating results for each segment during the year sealing products 
sales of million in were higher than the million reported in sales from acquisitions completed since at the consolidated garlock operations  technetics group  and stemco contributed about percentage points to the increase 
increases in volume  reflecting improved markets and increased market share  plus selected net price increases since were essentially offset by the sales decrease caused by the deconsolidation of gst 
sales from gst llc to third parties in through the petition date were million 
the consolidated garlock operations experienced improved demand in several markets including oil and gas  and rubber products  and in europe and asia 
technetics group demand was higher in in most markets and in several product lines 
stemco reported large increases in oem about  brake products about  and aftermarket demand about and prices increased about 
favorable foreign exchange rates contributed about two percentage points to the sales increase 
segment profit of million in increased compared to the million reported in despite higher volumes  some contribution from the acquisitions  and price increases  which nearly offset all cost increases  garlock earnings declined because of the deconsolidation of gst llc effective on the petition date 
segment profit for gst llc in through the petition date was million 
earnings at technetics increased compared to  but the increase was less than the improvement in sales because the incremental earnings at the acquired businesses are still developing 
stemco reported an increase in profit in connection with its higher volumes  including its acquired business  which was reduced by cost increases in excess of selected price increases in operating margins for the stemco brake products acquisition in were lower than the historical business  which is likely to be the case going forward due to the nature of the brake products market 
operating margins for the segment decreased to in from in engineered products 
sales of million in were higher than the million reported in acquisitions completed since favorably affected sales by about percentage points 
in addition  sales for ggb and cpi in were significantly higher than in as both operations continued to capture higher volume from improvements in several markets and selected price increases 
favorable foreign exchange rates contributed four percentage points to the segment s sales growth 
the segment profit in was million  which was higher than the million reported in increased profits at ggb and cpi came primarily from price increases and the additional sales volume partially offset by cost increases 
acquisitions completed since added percentage points to the increase and changes in foreign exchange rates added four percentage points 
operating margins for the segment were in  which improved from the reported last year 
engine products and services 
sales increased from million in to million in the increase in sales was primarily due to shipping engines in versus engines in  with a higher average price per engine in due to the types of engines shipped 
the engine products and services segment also recognized incremental revenue of million related to using the percentage of completion accounting method for new or nearly new engine programs beginning in the third quarter of these increases were partially offset by a decline in parts and services revenue in 
table of contents the segment reported a profit of million in compared to million in a lower margin mix of engine shipments in  the decrease in higher margin aftermarket parts and services activity  and net cost increases contributed to the decrease in segment profit 
in addition  the segment recorded a million estimated warranty expense to repair a specific engine component in a series of us navy ships 
the segment also recorded a million estimated loss on an engine contract 
the expected contract loss is a result of detrimental changes in the market for nuclear power plant emergency power engines after the tsunami in japan  which caused costs per nuclear related engine to be higher than expected  and the original engine costs for the program were underestimated 
these large costs were partially offset by cost reimbursements related to the canceled south texas project of approximately million  which reduced expenses in the third quarter of  the resolution of a legal matter  which reduced legal expenses by million  and approximately million of incremental profit related to the use of percentage of completion accounting beginning in the third quarter of operating margins dropped from in to this year 
compared to sales of million in increased from million in the increase in sales was primarily the result of stronger volumes in all segments 
the volume increases resulted principally from stronger automotive and industrial markets for ggb  higher oem and aftermarket truck and trailer activity at stemco  greater aftermarket activity at fairbanks morse engine  and improved oil and gas  nuclear and rubber product demand at garlock 
the additional sales from acquisitions completed since contributed three percentage points of the overall increase 
sales in included gst llc for the entire year while sales in included gst llc s sales only through the petition date 
sales to third parties for gst llc of million from the petition date through december   were not included as a result of the deconsolidation of gst llc effective on the petition date 
segment profit  management s primary measure of how our operations perform  increased from million in to million in segment margins  defined as segment profit divided by sales  improved from in to in segment profit and margins increased primarily due to higher volumes  net price increases that exceeded overall net cost increases  and earnings from businesses acquired since segment profit in reflected gst llc s and its subsidiaries results for the full year 
gst llc reported segment profit of million from the petition date through december   which is not reflected in our segment profit as a result of the deconsolidation 
net interest expense in was million compared to million in the increase in net interest expense was caused primarily by the deconsolidation of gst and the reflection of the associated interest expense on related party short term borrowings and related party notes payable by enpro to gst llc  which had previously been eliminated in consolidation 
we recorded goodwill impairment charges of million in  but there was no comparable charge in due to the deconsolidation of gst  asbestos related expenses during decreased by million compared to we recorded a pre tax gain on the deconsolidation of gst of million in  which is discussed in garlock sealing technologies llc and garrison litigation management group  ltd 
in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the gain is included in other income expense  net  in the preceding table 
other income  net  in resulted from a reassessment of a liability for retiree medical benefits for former employees of a previously divested business 
an actuarial assessment determined our expected liability was significantly less than the amount previously accrued and as a result the liability was reduced 

table of contents our effective tax rate was in and in we recorded an income tax expense of million on pre tax income from continuing operations of million in the tax expense was favorably affected by restructuring part of our ggb operation in europe 
during  our effective tax rate was as we recorded an income tax benefit of million on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of million 
the income tax expense in was significantly affected by the goodwill impairment charge and the jurisdictional mix of earnings 
net income from continuing operations was million  or per share  in compared to a net loss from continuing operations of million  or per share  in net income was million  or per share in compared to a net loss of million  or per share  in earnings loss per share are expressed on a diluted basis 
following is a discussion of operating results for each segment during the year sealing products 
sales of million in were slightly lower than the million reported in the deconsolidation of gst llc was the principal factor in the lack of year over year growth 
gst llc sales to third parties of million from the petition date through december   were not included as a result of the deconsolidation of gst effective on the petition date 
acquisitions completed since  which contributed to the sales growth  improved industrial markets  and the inclusion of the results of technetics during partially offset the effect of the deconsolidation 
stemco s sales during increased compared to primarily as a result of higher volumes for its oem and aftermarket business and the introduction of new brake products 
plastomer technologies experienced a sales increase in compared to due to higher volumes in its semiconductor business 
segment profit of million in increased compared to the million reported in the increase in profit in our garlock group of companies reflected a benefit from higher volumes  the inclusion of the acquired technetics business  and various net price increases partially offset by the deconsolidation of gst llc  which reported segment profit of million subsequent to its deconsolidation  and various cost increases 
stemco reported a significant increase in profit primarily due to increased production and demand in heavy duty vehicle markets partially offset by cost increases 
likewise  higher volume bolstered plastomer technologies results as it also reported improved earnings compared to last year 
operating margins for the segment increased to in from in engineered products 
sales of million in were higher than the million reported in acquisitions completed since the second quarter of favorably impacted revenue by six percentage points 
decreases in the value of foreign currencies reduced the year over year sales increase by two percentage points 
the remaining twenty three percentage points of the sales increase reflected improved market conditions within the segment 
sales for ggb in were significantly higher than the amount reported in primarily due to increased volume in automotive and industrial markets 
sales for cpi in increased principally due to the acquisitions  and the business experienced favorable conditions in refining markets in the us  europe  and south america 
activity in cpi s north american natural gas markets remained low due to continued high levels of natural gas storage 
the segment profit in of million improved significantly compared to the million segment loss reported in ggb s profitability improved in primarily due to higher volume in its automotive and industrial markets and the results of cost reduction efforts 
profits at cpi declined in compared to due to the costs of establishing new service centers  the implementation of a new 
table of contents erp system  and various other growth related initiatives 
the operating margin in for the segment reflected the segment s return to profitability compared to a segment loss in as ggb s strong earnings improvement was partially offset by cpi s decrease in segment profit on its higher sales 
engine products and services 
sales of million in were essentially flat compared to the million reported in the effect of fewer new engine shipments in was mostly offset by increased aftermarket parts and service sales for the us navy and other customers  and some improvements in pricing 
the segment reported a profit of million in compared to million in the year over year improvement was a result of the aftermarket volume increase combined with net cost decreases and pricing increases 
operating margins for the segment increased to in from in restructuring and other costs restructuring expense was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
in  the expense was primarily related to restructuring activities associated with workforce reductions at ggb and in the garlock group of companies 
liquidity and capital resources cash requirements for  but not limited to  working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  pension contributions  and debt repayments have been funded from cash balances on hand  revolver borrowings  and cash generated from operations 
we are proactively pursuing acquisition opportunities 
it is possible our cash requirements for one or more of these acquisition opportunities could exceed our cash balance at the time of closing 
should we need additional capital  we have other resources available  which are discussed in this section under the heading of capital resources 
as of december   we held approximately million in cash and cash equivalents in the united states and approximately million in cash and cash equivalents outside of the united states 
we believe our cash and cash equivalents  operating cash flows  and borrowing capacity are adequate to fund our cash needs in cash flows operating activities provided million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in operating cash flows in versus was primarily attributable to our increased earnings and the tax payment resulting from the gain on the sale of quincy compressor made in  which did not recur in  partially offset by higher contributions to the us defined benefit plans in the decrease in operating cash flows between and was primarily attributable to the tax payment resulting from the gain on the sale of quincy compressor  which more than offset improvements in cash generated by our operations 
in addition  gst llc generated million of operating cash flows after its deconsolidation on the petition date  which were not included in our total 
in  gst reported million of operating cash flows  which also were not included in our results 
we used million  net  in for investing activities  received million  net  in  and used million  net  in in  we used million net of cash acquired to purchase six businesses 
please refer to acquisitions and dispositions in part i  item business for additional discussion regarding these transactions 
we also spent million for capital expenditures 
table of contents across all of our businesses 
the net cash inflow provided by investing activities in resulted from the proceeds of the divestiture of quincy compressor 
this cash receipt was partially offset by capital expenditures and the cash retained by gst llc and its subsidiaries in connection with their deconsolidation 
the deconsolidation of gst llc is discussed further in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the garlock sealing technologies llc and garrison litigation management group  ltd

garlock sealing technologies llc and garrison litigation management group  ltd 
the historical business operations of gst llc and anchor have resulted in a substantial volume of asbestos litigation in which plaintiffs have alleged personal injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos fibers 
those subsidiaries manufactured and or sold industrial sealing products  predominately gaskets and packing  containing encapsulated asbestos fibers 
anchor is an inactive and insolvent indirect subsidiary of coltec 
the company s subsidiaries exposure to asbestos litigation and their relationships with insurance carriers have been managed through another coltec subsidiary  garrison 
on the petition date  gst llc  anchor and garrison filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
the filings were the initial step in a claims resolution process 
the goal of the process is an efficient and permanent resolution of all current and future asbestos claims through court approval of a plan of reorganization  which is expected to establish a trust to which all asbestos claims will be channeled for resolution 
gst intends to seek an agreement with asbestos claimants and other creditors on the terms of a plan for the establishment of such a trust and repayment of other creditors in full  or in the absence of such an agreement an order of the bankruptcy court confirming such a plan 
prior to its deconsolidation effective on the petition date  gst llc and its subsidiaries operated as part of the garlock group of companies within enpro s sealing products segment 
gst llc designs  manufactures and sells sealing products  including metallic  non metallic and composite material gaskets  rotary seals  compression packing  resilient metal seals  elastomeric seals  hydraulic components  and expansion joints 
gst llc and its subsidiaries operate five primary manufacturing facilities  including gst llc s operations in palmyra  new york and houston  texas 
garrison s principal business is to manage the defense of all asbestos related litigation affecting the company s subsidiaries  principally gst llc and anchor  arising from their sale or use of products or materials containing asbestos  and to manage  bill and collect available insurance proceeds 
when it commenced business in  garrison acquired certain assets of gst llc and assumed certain liabilities stemming from asbestos related claims against gst llc 
garrison is not itself a defendant in asbestos related litigation and has no direct liability for asbestos related claims 
rather  it has assumed gst llc s liability for such claims and agreed to indemnify gst llc from liability with respect to such claims 
anchor was a distributor of products containing asbestos and was acquired by gst llc in anchor has been inactive and insolvent since 
table of contents the financial results of gst and subsidiaries were included in our consolidated results through june   the day prior to the petition date 
however  us generally accepted accounting principles require that an entity that files for protection under the us bankruptcy code  whether solvent or insolvent  whose financial statements were previously consolidated with those of its parent  as gst s and its subsidiaries were with ours  generally must be prospectively deconsolidated from the parent and the investment accounted for using the cost method 
at deconsolidation  our investment was recorded at its estimated fair value on june   resulting in a gain for reporting purposes 
the cost method requires us to present our ownership interests in the net assets of gst at the petition date as an investment and to not recognize any income or loss from gst and subsidiaries in our results of operations during the reorganization period 
when gst emerges from the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court  the subsequent accounting will be determined based upon the applicable circumstances and facts at such time  including the terms of any plan of reorganization 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for condensed financial information for gst and subsidiaries 
gst s third party sales and operating income from the date of deconsolidation through december   were million and million  respectively 
gst was included in our consolidated us federal income tax return and certain state combined income tax returns 
as the parent of these consolidated tax groups  we are liable for  and pay  income taxes owed by the entire group 
we have agreed with gst to allocate group taxes to gst based on the us consolidated tax return regulations and accounting standards codification topic income taxes 
this method generally allocates current and deferred taxes to gst as if it were a separate taxpayer 
as a result  we carry an income tax receivable from gst related to this allocation 
at december   this amount was approximately million 
under the agreement s cash settlement schedule  this receivable is expected to be collected at a future date  and was included in our consolidated balance sheet as a non current asset 
as a result of the deconsolidation of gst  we conducted an analysis to compare the fair market value of gst to its book value 
based on this analysis  we recognized a million non cash pre tax gain on the deconsolidation of gst in the second quarter of the fair value of gst  net of taxes on the gain on deconsolidation  was recorded at million 
our million investment value is subject to periodic reviews for impairment 
gst will be presented using the cost method during the reorganization period 
in connection with the bankruptcy filing  gst llc and garrison entered into a million debtor in possession revolving credit and letter of credit facility with bank of america  na with a maturity date of december  the debtor in possession revolving credit facility was terminated by gst llc and garrison in october we have assessed gst llc s and garrison s liquidity position as a result of the bankruptcy filing and believe both entities can continue to fund their operating activities  and those of their subsidiaries  and meet their capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  the ability of gst llc and garrison to continue as going concerns is dependent upon their ability to resolve their ultimate asbestos liability in the bankruptcy from their net assets  future cash flows  and available insurance proceeds  whether through the confirmation of a plan of reorganization or otherwise 
as a result of the bankruptcy filing and related events  there can be no assurance the carrying values of the assets  including the carrying value of the business and the tax receivable  will be realized or that liabilities will be liquidated or settled for the amounts recorded 
in addition  a plan of reorganization  or rejection thereof  could change the amounts reported in the gst llc and garrison financial statements and cause a material change in the carrying amount of our investment 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about gst s bankruptcy proceeding 

table of contents dividends to date  we have not paid dividends and we do not intend to pay a dividend in the foreseeable future 
if availability under our senior secured revolving credit facility falls below million  we would be limited in our ability to pay dividends 
as of december   we exceeded this minimum threshold 
the indenture that governs the convertible debentures does not restrict us from paying dividends 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures pertaining to contingent assets and liabilities 
note  overview and significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring  pensions and other postretirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies and estimates are the most critical 
some of them involve significant judgments and uncertainties and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized at the time title and risk of product ownership is transferred or when services are rendered with the exception of engine revenue recognition in the engine products and services segment as described in the next three paragraphs 
shipping costs billed to customers are recognized as revenue and expensed in cost of goods sold 
during the third quarter of  the engine products and services segment began using percentage of completion poc accounting for new and nearly new engine contracts rather than the completed contract method 
we made this change because  as a result of enhancements to the financial management and reporting systems  the segment is able to reasonably estimate the revenue  costs  and progress towards completion of engine builds 
if we are not able to meet those conditions for a particular engine contract  the segment will recognize revenues using the completed contract method 
progress towards completion is measured by reference to costs incurred to date as a percentage of estimated total project costs 
recognized revenues and profits are subject to revisions during the engine build period in the event the assumptions regarding the overall contract outcome are revised 
the cumulative effect of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such a revision becomes likely and estimable 
losses on contracts in progress are accounted for in the period a loss becomes likely and estimable 
we recognized revenues and operating income of million and million  respectively  for the year ended december   on contracts accounted for under the poc method 

table of contents the engine products and services segment will continue to use the completed contract method for engines in production at june  revenue recognition for engine products and services parts and services revenue did not change nor did the revenue recognition policy for the sealing products or engineered products segment 
asbestos through the petition date  gst accrued for known and estimated future asbestos claims for subsequent ten year periods and recorded legal fees and expenses only when incurred 
the significant assumptions underlying the material components of the estimated liability included the number and trend of claims asserted  the mix of alleged diseases or impairment  the trend in the number of claims for malignant cases  primarily mesothelioma  the probability some existing and potential future claims would eventually be dismissed without payment  the estimated amount to be paid per claim  and the timing and impact of large amounts available for the payment of claims from the g trusts of former defendants in bankruptcy 
with the assistance of bates white  a recognized expert  we periodically reviewed the period over which we could make a reasonable estimate  the assumptions underlying the estimate  the range of reasonably possible potential liabilities and management s estimate of the liability  and adjust the estimate if necessary 
additional discussion is included in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in contingencies asbestos 
derivative instruments and hedging activities we have entered into contracts to hedge forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies occurring at various dates through january we account for most of these contracts as cash flow hedges 
as a cash flow hedge  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the contracts is reported in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion is reported in income 
amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income are reclassified into income in the period when the hedged transactions occur 
pensions and postretirement benefits we and certain of our subsidiaries sponsor domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  rate of increase in employee compensation levels and assumed health care cost trend rates 
assumptions are determined based on data available to us and appropriate market indicators  and are evaluated each year as of the plans measurement date 
a change in any of these assumptions could have a material effect on net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs reported in the consolidated statements of operations  as well as amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of pension and postretirement benefits 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
temporary differences arising between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its carrying amount on the consolidated balance sheet are used to calculate future income tax assets or liabilities 
this method also requires the recognition of deferred tax benefits  such as net operating loss carryforwards 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to the 
table of contents taxable income losses in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of income taxes 
goodwill and other intangible assets we do not amortize goodwill  but instead it is subject to annual impairment testing 
the goodwill asset impairment test involves comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a second step of comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the carrying amount of that goodwill is required to measure the potential goodwill impairment loss 
there are inherent assumptions and estimates used in developing future cash flows which require management to apply judgment to the analysis of intangible asset impairment  including projecting revenues  interest rates  cost of capital  royalty rates and tax rates 
many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management  and it is reasonably likely that assumptions and estimates will change in future periods 
these changes can result in future impairments 
contingencies general various claims  lawsuits and administrative proceedings with respect to commercial  product liability  asbestos and environmental matters  all arising in the ordinary course of business  are pending or threatened against us or our subsidiaries and seek monetary damages and or other remedies 
we believe any liability finally determined with respect to commercial and non asbestos product liability claims should not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
from time to time  we and our subsidiaries are involved as plaintiffs in legal proceedings involving contract  patent protection  environmental  insurance and other matters 
expenses for legal and administrative proceedings are recorded as expenses when incurred 
environmental our facilities and operations are subject to federal  state and local environmental and occupational health and safety requirements of the us and foreign countries 
we take a proactive approach in our efforts to comply with environmental  health and safety laws as they relate to our manufacturing operations and in proposing and implementing any remedial plans that may be necessary 
we also regularly conduct comprehensive environmental  health and safety audits at our facilities to maintain compliance and improve operational efficiency 
although we believe past operations were in substantial compliance with the then applicable regulations  we or one of our subsidiaries have been named as a potentially responsible party  or are otherwise involved  at sites where the costs to us are expected to exceed thousand 
investigations have been completed for sites and are in progress at the other three sites 
the majority of these sites relate to remedial actions at former operating facilities that were sold or closed and primarily deal with soil and groundwater contamination 
as of december  and  enpro had accrued liabilities of million and million  respectively  for estimated future expenditures relating to environmental contingencies

subsidiary bankruptcy three of our subsidiaries filed voluntary chapter bankruptcy petitions on the petition date as a result of tens of thousands of pending and expected future asbestos personal injury claims 
the filings were the initial step in a claims resolution process 
the goal of the process is an efficient and permanent resolution of all pending and future asbestos claims through court approval of a plan of reorganization that will establish a trust to which all asbestos claims will be channeled for resolution and payment 
see the additional information provided earlier under the heading garlock sealing technologies llc and garrison litigation management group  ltd  the discussion under the heading asbestos below and notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
this process presents a number of risks and uncertainties many of which are described in part i  item a risk factors 
asbestos background on asbestos related litigation and recent developments 
the historical business operations of gst llc and anchor have resulted in a substantial volume of asbestos litigation in which plaintiffs have alleged that exposure to asbestos fibers in products produced or sold by gst llc or anchor  together with products produced and sold by numerous other companies contributed to the bodily injuries or death of such plaintiffs 
those subsidiaries manufactured and or sold industrial sealing products that contained encapsulated asbestos fibers 
our subsidiaries exposure to asbestos litigation and their relationships with insurance carriers have been managed through garrison 
on the petition date  gst llc  garrison and anchor filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code in the us bankruptcy court for the western district of north carolina in charlotte 
see above under the heading subsidiary bankruptcy and notes and to our consolidated financial statements for more information about this bankruptcy filing and its effects 

table of contents gst llc and anchor have been among a large number of defendants in actions filed in various states by plaintiffs alleging injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos fibers 
among the many products at issue in these actions are industrial sealing products  including gaskets and packing 
the damages claimed have varied from action to action  and in some cases plaintiffs seek both compensatory and punitive damages 
to date  neither gst llc nor anchor has been required to pay any punitive damage awards 
beginning in  the top tier asbestos defendants companies that paid most of the plaintiffs damages because they produced and sold huge quantities of highly friable asbestos products sought bankruptcy protection and stopped paying asbestos claims in the tort system 
the bankruptcies of many additional producers of friable asbestos products followed 
the plaintiffs could no longer pursue actions against these large defendants during the pendency of their bankruptcy proceedings  even though these defendants had historically been determined to be the largest contributors to asbestos related injuries 
many plaintiffs pursued gst llc in civil court actions to recover compensation formerly paid by top tier bankrupt companies under state law principles of joint and several liability and began identifying gst llc s non friable sealing products as a primary cause of their asbestos diseases while generally denying exposure to the friable products of companies in bankruptcy 
gst llc believes this targeting strategy effectively shifted damages caused by top tier defendants that produced friable asbestos products to gst llc  thereby materially increasing gst llc s cost of defending and resolving claims 
almost all of the top tier defendants that sought bankruptcy relief in the early s have now emerged  or are positioning to emerge  from bankruptcy 
their asbestos liabilities have been assumed by wealthy g trusts created in the bankruptcies with assets contributed by the emerging former defendants and their affiliates 
with the emergence of these companies from bankruptcy  many plaintiffs will seek compensation from the g trusts 
these trusts have aggregate assets exceeding billion billion according to a study released in september by the united states government accountability office specifically set aside to compensate individuals with asbestos diseases caused by the friable products of those defendants 
we believe that as billions of dollars of g trust assets continue to become available to claimants  defendants will obtain significant reductions in their costs to defend and resolve claims 
as of the petition date  however  the establishment of these g trusts had taken longer than anticipated and the trusts had a significant backlog of claims that accumulated while the trusts were being established 
additionally  procedures adopted for the submissions of asbestos claims in bankruptcy cases and against g trusts made it difficult for gst llc and other tort system co defendants to gain access to information about claims made against bankrupt defendants or the accompanying evidence of exposure to the asbestos containing products of such bankrupt defendants 
we believe these procedures enable claimants to double dip by collecting payments from defendants in the tort system under joint and several liability principles for injuries caused by the former top tier defendants while also collecting substantial additional amounts from g trusts established by those former defendants to pay asbestos claims 
because of these factors  while several g trusts had begun making substantial payments to claimants prior to the petition date  gst llc had not yet experienced a significant reduction in damages being sought from gst llc 
in light of gst llc s experience that a its cost of defending and resolving claims had not declined as anticipated although g trusts had begun making substantial payments to claimants  and b new mesothelioma claims filings against it in recent years had not declined at a rate similar to the rate of decline in disease incidence  gst initiated the chapter proceedings as a means to determine and comprehensively resolve their asbestos liability 
during the pendency of the chapter proceedings certain actions proposed to be taken by gst not in the ordinary course of business will be subject to approval by the bankruptcy court 
as a result  during the pendency of these proceedings  we will not have exclusive control over these companies 
accordingly  under us generally accepted accounting principles  our investment in gst was 
table of contents deconsolidated from our financial results beginning on the petition date 
as a result  our financial results for the year ended december   which include the results from gst only through the petition date  may not be comparable to those of prior  current and future year periods 
much of the remaining portion of this section updates information about our subsidiaries asbestos claims management experience through and until the petition date 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about claims mix  product defenses  recent trial results and appeals 
insurance coverage 
at december   we had million of insurance coverage we believe is available to cover current and future asbestos claims against gst llc and certain expense payments 
gst has collected insurance payments totaling million since the petition date 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about the quality of these insurance and trust assets 
liability estimate 
prior to mid  we maintained that our subsidiaries liability for unasserted claims was not reasonably estimable 
we estimated and recorded liabilities only for pending claims in advanced stages of processing  for which we believed we had a basis for making a reasonable estimate 
we disclosed the significance of the total potential liability for unasserted claims in considerable detail 
during  we authorized counsel to retain bates white  a recognized expert  to assist in estimating our subsidiaries liability for pending and future asbestos claims 
we have updated our estimate of the subsidiary liability regularly 
in prior to the petition date  we recorded a pre tax charge of million in connection with the update of gst llc s asbestos liability 
the charge reflects million of fees and expenses paid during the period and a million non cash charge 
in  we recorded a pre tax charge of million to reflect cash outlays of million for fees and expenses and a million non cash charge 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our liability estimate 
quantitative claims and insurance information 
our recorded asbestos liability at the petition date was million 
as of the petition date  we had remaining insurance and trust coverage of million  which included million in insured claims and expenses our subsidiaries have paid out in excess of amounts recovered from insurance 
these amounts are recoverable under the terms of our insurance policies  subject to potential competing claims of other covered subsidiaries  and have been billed to the insurance carriers 
off balance sheet arrangements lease agreements we have a number of operating leases primarily for real estate  equipment and vehicles 
operating lease arrangements are generally utilized to secure the use of assets from time to time if the terms and conditions of the lease or the nature of the asset makes the lease arrangement more favorable than a purchase 
as of december   approximately million of future minimum lease payments were outstanding under these agreements 
see note  commitments and contingencies other commitments  to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure 

table of contents contractual obligations a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments at december   is as follows payments due by period in millions contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt notes payable to gst interest on long term debt interest on notes payable to gst operating leases other long term liabilities total payment for long term debt may be accelerated under certain circumstances because the convertible debentures due in may be converted earlier  requiring payment of the principal amount thereof in cash 
in the event of an early conversion  we believe we would refinance the convertible debentures with an unsecured public debt offering or with other funding available at the time 
the payments for long term debt shown in the table above reflect the contractual principal amount for the convertible debentures 
in our consolidated balance sheet  this amount is shown net of a debt discount pursuant to the applicable accounting rules 
additional discussion regarding the convertible debentures is included in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in liquidity and capital resources capital resources  and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the interest on long term debt represents the contractual interest coupon 
it does not include the debt discount accretion  which also is a component of interest expense 
the notes payable to gst llc bear interest at per annum  of which is payable in cash and is added to the principal amount as payment in kind pik interest 
if gst llc is unable to pay ordinary course operating expenses  under certain conditions  gst llc can require the company to pay in cash the accrued pik interest necessary to meet such ordinary course operating expenses  subject to a cap of of the principal balance of each note in any calendar month and of the principal balance of each note in any year 
the interest due under the notes payable to gst llc may be satisfied through offsets of amounts due under intercompany services agreements pursuant to which the company provides certain corporate services and insurance coverages to gst llc  makes advances to third party providers related to payroll and certain benefit plans sponsored by gst llc  and permits employees of gst llc to participate in certain of the company s benefit plans 
the table above reflects million of total pik interest as principal payments at the due date of the notes 
payments for other long term liabilities are estimates of amounts to be paid for environmental and retained liabilities of previously owned businesses included in the consolidated balance sheets at december  these estimated payments are based on information currently known to us 
however  it is possible that these estimates will vary from actual results if new information becomes available in the future or if there are changes in the facts and circumstances related to these liabilities 
additional discussion regarding these liabilities is included earlier in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in contingencies environmental  contingencies colt firearms and central moloney  contingencies crucible materials corporation  and in note to the consolidated financial statements
