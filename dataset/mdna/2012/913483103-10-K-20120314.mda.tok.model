item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as those factors discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k  or in our other reports filed from time to time with the securities and exchange commission  may affect our actual results and may contribute to or cause our actual consolidated results to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward looking statements 
the factors included here are not exhaustive 
further  any forward looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made  and we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
new factors emerge from time to time  and it is not possible for management to predict all such factors  nor can we assess the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
therefore  forward looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual future results 
while we believe that the forward looking statements made in this report are based on reasonable assumptions  the actual outcome of such statements is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including the failure of our markets to continue growing and expanding in the manner we anticipated  the failure of our customers to grow and expand as we anticipated  the effects of natural or other events beyond our control  including the effects of political unrest  war or terrorist activities may have on us or the economy  the economic environment s effect on us or our customers  the growth of  acceptance of and the demand for our products and technologies in various markets and geographical regions  including cable  satellite  consumer electronics  retail  digital media technology  cedia  and interactive tv industries not materializing or growing as we believed  our inability to add profitable complementary products which are accepted by the marketplace  our inability to attract and retain quality workforce at adequate 
table of contents levels in all regions of the world  and particularly asia  our inability to continue to maintain our operating costs at acceptable levels through our cost containment efforts  our inability to realize tax benefits from various tax projects initiated from time to time  our inability to continue selling our products or licensing our technologies at higher or profitable margins  our inability to obtain orders or maintain our order volume with new and existing customers  the possible dilutive effect our stock incentive programs may have on our earnings per share and stock price  our inability to continue to obtain adequate quantities of component parts or secure adequate factory production capacity on a timely basis  and other factors listed from time to time in our press releases and filings with the securities and exchange commission 
risks related to doing business in the people s republic of china changes in the policies of the people s republic of china prc government may have a significant impact upon the business we may be able to conduct in the prc and the profitability of such business 
our business operations may be adversely affected by the current and future political environment in the prc 
the prc has operated as a socialist state since the mid s and is controlled by the prc s communist party 
the chinese government exerts substantial influence and control over the manner in which we must conduct our business activities 
the prc has only permitted provincial and local economic autonomy and private economic activities since the government of the prc has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over virtually every sector of the chinese economy  through regulation and state ownership 
our ability to operate in the prc may be adversely affected by changes in chinese laws and regulations  including those relating to taxation  labor and social insurance  import and export tariffs  raw materials  environmental regulations  land use rights  property and other matters 
under current leadership  the government of the prc has been pursuing economic reform policies that encourage private economic activity and greater economic decentralization 
there is no assurance  however  that the government of the prc will continue to pursue these policies  or that it will not significantly alter these policies from time to time without notice 
the prc s economy is in a transition from a planned economy to a market oriented economy subject to five year and annual plans adopted by the government that set national economic development goals 
policies of the prc government may have significant effects on the economic conditions of the prc 
the prc government has confirmed that economic development will follow the model of a market economy 
under this direction  we believe that the prc will continue to strengthen its economic and trading relationships with foreign countries and business development in the prc will follow market forces 
while we believe that this trend will continue  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
a change in policies by the prc government may adversely affect our interests by  among other factors changes in laws  regulations or the interpretation thereof  confiscatory taxation  restrictions on currency conversion  imports or sources of supplies  or the expropriation or nationalization of private enterprises 
although the prc government has been pursuing economic reform policies for more than two decades  there is no assurance that the government will continue to pursue such policies or that such policies may not be significantly altered  especially in the event of a change in leadership  social or political disruption  or other circumstances affecting the prc s political  economic and social life 
the prc laws and regulations governing our current business operations are sometimes vague and uncertain 
any changes in such prc laws and regulations may harm our business 
the prc laws and regulations governing our current business operations are sometimes vague and uncertain 
the prc s legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes  in which decided legal cases have little value as precedents unlike the common law system prevalent in the united states 
there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of prc laws and regulations  including but not limited to the laws and regulations governing our business  or the enforcement and performance of our arrangements with customers in the event of the imposition of statutory liens  death  bankruptcy and criminal proceedings 
the chinese government has been developing a comprehensive system of commercial laws  and considerable progress has been made in introducing laws and regulations dealing with economic matters such as foreign investment  corporate organization and governance  labor and social insurance  commerce  taxation and trade 
however  because these laws and regulations are relatively new  and because of the limited volume of published cases and judicial interpretation and their lack of force as precedents  interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations involve significant uncertainties 
new laws and regulations that affect existing and proposed future businesses may also be applied 
table of contents retroactively 
we are considered a foreign person or foreign funded enterprise under prc laws  and as a result  we are required to comply with prc laws and regulations 
we cannot predict what effect the interpretation of existing or new prc laws or regulations may have on our businesses 
if the relevant authorities find that we are in violation of prc laws or regulations  they would have broad discretion in dealing with such a violation  including  without limitation levying fines  revoking our business and other licenses  requiring that we restructure our ownership or operations  and requiring that we discontinue any portion or all of our business 
the fluctuation of the chinese yuan renminbi may harm your investment 
under chinese monetary policy  the chinese yuan renminbi is permitted to fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of certain foreign currencies 
this policy  which was initiated during  has resulted in an approximately appreciation of the chinese yuan renminbi against the us dollar as of december  while the international reaction to the chinese yuan renminbi revaluation has been positive  there remains significant international pressure on the prc government to adopt an even more flexible currency policy  which could result in a further and more significant appreciation of the chinese yuan renminbi against the us dollar 
the prc s legal and judicial system may not adequately protect our business and operations and the rights of foreign investors 
the prc legal and judicial system may negatively impact foreign investors 
in an amendment to the prc s constitution  foreign investment and the guarantee of the lawful rights and interests of foreign investors in the prc was made possible 
however  the prc s system of laws is not yet comprehensive 
the legal and judicial systems in the prc are still rudimentary  and enforcement of existing laws is inconsistent 
the prc judiciary is relatively inexperienced in enforcing the laws that do exist  resulting in judicial decision making that is more uncertain than would be expected elsewhere in the world 
it may be impossible to obtain swift and equitable enforcement of laws that do exist  or to obtain enforcement of the judgment of one court by a court of another jurisdiction 
the prc s legal system is based on the civil law regime  that is  it is based on written statutes  a decision by one judge does not set a legal precedent that is required to be followed by judges in other cases 
in addition  the interpretation of chinese laws may be varied to reflect domestic political changes 
the promulgation of new laws  changes to existing laws and the pre emption of local regulations by national laws may adversely affect foreign investors 
however  the trend of legislation since the amendment to the prc s constitution has significantly enhanced the protection of foreign investment and allowed for more control by foreign parties of their investments in chinese enterprises 
there can be no assurance that a change in leadership  social or political disruption  or unforeseen circumstances affecting the prc s political  economic or social life  will not affect the prc government s ability to continue to support and pursue these reforms 
such a shift may have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects 
availability of adequate workforce levels presently  the vast majority of workers at our prc factories are obtained from third party employment agencies 
as the labor laws  social insurance and wage levels continue to mature and grow and the workers become more sophisticated  our costs to employ these and other workers in the prc may grow beyond that anticipated by management 
in addition  as the prc market continues to open up and grow  with the advent of more companies opening plants and businesses in the prc  we could experience an increase in competing for the same workers  resulting in either an inability to attract and retain an adequate number of qualified workers or an increase in our employment costs to obtain and retain these workers 
expansion in the prc as our global business grows  we may decide to expand in china to meet demand 
this would be dependent on our ability to locate suitable facilities to support this expansion  to obtain the necessary permits and funding  to attract and retain adequate levels of qualified workers  and to enter into a long term land lease that is common in the prc 

table of contents any recurrence of severe acute respiratory syndrome  or sars  or other widespread public health problems  could harm our operations 
a renewed outbreak of sars or other widespread public health problems such as bird flu and swine flu in the prc could significantly harm our operations 
our operations may be impacted by a number of health related factors  including quarantines or closures of some of our offices that would adversely disrupt our operations 
any of the foregoing events or other unforeseen consequences of public health problems could significantly harm our operations 
risks related to the recent financial crisis and severe tightening in the global credit markets general economic conditions  both domestic and international  have an impact on our business and financial results 
the ongoing global financial crisis affecting the banking system and financial markets has resulted in a severe tightening in the credit markets  a low level of liquidity in many financial markets  and extreme volatility in credit and equity markets 
this financial crisis may impact our business in a number of ways  including potential deferment of purchases and orders by customers uncertainty about current and future global economic conditions may cause consumers  businesses and governments to defer purchases in response to tighter credit  decreased cash availability and declining consumer confidence 
accordingly  future demand for our products may differ materially from our current expectations 
customers inability to obtain financing to make purchases from us and or maintain their business some of our customers require substantial financing in order to fund their operations and make purchases from us 
the inability of these customers to obtain sufficient credit to finance purchases of our products may adversely impact our financial results 
in addition  if the financial crisis results in insolvencies for our customers  it may adversely impact our financial results 
potential impact on trade receivables credit market conditions may slow our collection efforts as customers experience increased difficulty in obtaining requisite financing  leading to higher than normal accounts receivable balances and longer dsos 
this may result in greater expense associated with collection efforts and increased bad debt expense 
negative impact from increased financial pressures on third party dealers  distributors and retailers we make sales in certain regions of the world through third party dealers  distributors and retailers 
although many of these third parties have significant operations and maintain access to available credit  others are smaller and more likely to be impacted by the significant decrease in available credit that has resulted from the current financial crisis 
if credit pressures or other financial difficulties result in insolvency for these third parties and we are unable to successfully transition our end customers to purchase products from other third parties or from us directly  it may adversely impact our financial results 
negative impact from increased financial pressures on key suppliers our ability to meet customers demands depends  in part  on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of quality materials  parts and components from our suppliers 
certain of our components are available only from a single source or limited sources 
if certain key suppliers were to become capacity constrained or insolvent as a result of the financial crisis  it may result in a reduction or interruption in supplies or a significant increase in the price of supplies and adversely impact our financial results 
in addition  credit constraints at key suppliers may result in accelerated payment of accounts payable by us  impacting our cash flow 
dependence upon key suppliers during  samsung provided million  or  of our total inventory purchases 
during  samsung and computime each provided over of our total inventory purchases 
purchases from these suppliers collectively amounted to million  or  of our total inventory purchases in during  samsung  computime  cg development  and samjin each provided over of our total inventory purchases 
purchases from these suppliers collectively amounted to million  or  of our total inventory purchases in 
table of contents most of the components used in our products are available from multiple sources 
however  we have elected to purchase integrated circuits  used principally in our wireless control products  from primarily three sources 
to reduce our dependence on our integrated circuits suppliers we continually seek additional sources 
we maintain inventories of our integrated circuits  which may be used in part to mitigate  but not eliminate  delays resulting from supply interruptions 
we have identified alternative sources of supply for our integrated circuit  component parts  and finished goods needs  however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain these inventory purchases on a timely basis 
any extended interruption  shortage or termination in the supply of any of the components used in our products  or a reduction in their quality or reliability  or a significant increase in prices of components  would have an adverse effect on our operating results  financial position and cash flows 
disruption of our supply chain could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations our ability  including manufacturing or distribution capabilities  and that of our suppliers  business partners and contract manufacturers  to make  move and sell products is critical to our success 
damage or disruption to our or their manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather  natural disaster  fire or explosion  terrorism  pandemics  strikes  or other reasons  could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products 
failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events  or to effectively manage such events if they occur  could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations  as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain 
dependence on foreign manufacturing even after our acquisition of the factories in the prc  third party manufacturers located in the prc will continue to manufacture a majority of our products 
our arrangements with these foreign manufacturers are subject to the risks of doing business abroad  such as tariffs  environmental and trade restrictions  intellectual property protection and enforcement  export license requirements  work stoppages  political and social instability  economic and labor conditions  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  changes in laws and policies including fiscal policies  and other factors  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and cash flows 
we believe that the loss of any one or more of our manufacturers would not have a long term material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and cash flows  because numerous other manufacturers are available to fulfill our requirements  however  the loss of any of our major manufacturers may adversely affect our business  operating results  financial condition and cash flows until alternative manufacturing arrangements are secured 
potential fluctuations in quarterly results we may from time to time increase our operating expenses to fund greater levels of research and development  sales and marketing activities  development of new distribution channels  improvements in our operational and financial systems and development of our customer support capabilities  and to support our efforts to comply with various government regulations 
to the extent such expenses precede or are not subsequently followed by increased revenues  our business  operating results  financial condition and cash flows will be adversely affected 
in addition  we may experience significant fluctuations in future quarterly operating results that may be caused by many other factors  including demand for our products  introduction or enhancement of products by us and our competitors  the loss or acquisition of any significant customers  market acceptance of new products  price reductions by us or our competitors  mix of distribution channels through which our products are sold  product or supply constraints  level of product returns  mix of customers and products sold  component pricing  mix of international and domestic revenues  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and general economic conditions 
in addition  as a strategic response to changes in the competitive environment  we may from time to time make certain pricing or marketing decisions or acquisitions that may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
as a result  we believe period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 

table of contents due to all of the foregoing factors  it is possible that in some future quarters our operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
if this happens the price of our common stock may be materially adversely affected 
dependence on consumer preference we are susceptible to fluctuations in our business based upon consumer demand for our products 
in addition  we cannot guarantee that increases in demand for our products associated with increases in the deployment of new technology will continue 
we believe that our success depends on our ability to anticipate  gauge and respond to fluctuations in consumer preferences 
however  it is impossible to predict with complete accuracy the occurrence and effect of fluctuations in consumer demand over a product s life cycle 
moreover  we caution that any growth in revenues that we achieve may be transitory and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
demand for consumer service and support we have continually provided domestic and international consumer service and support to our customers to add overall value and to help differentiate us from our competitors 
we continually review our service and support group and are marketing our expertise in this area to other potential customers 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract new customers in the future 
in addition  certain of our products have more features and are more complex than others and therefore require more end user technical support 
in some instances  we rely on distributors or dealers to provide the initial level of technical support to the end users 
we provide the second level of technical support for bug fixes and other issues at no additional charge 
therefore  as the mix of our products includes more of these complex product lines  support costs may increase  which may have an adverse effect on our business  operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
dependence upon new product introduction our ability to remain competitive in the wireless control and av accessory products market will depend considerably upon our ability to successfully identify new product opportunities  as well as develop and introduce these products and enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful at developing and marketing new products or enhancing our existing products  or that these new or enhanced products will achieve consumer acceptance and  if achieved  will sustain that acceptance 
in addition  there can be no assurance that products developed by others will not render our products non competitive or obsolete or that we will be able to obtain or maintain the rights to use proprietary technologies developed by others which are incorporated in our products 
any failure to anticipate or respond adequately to technological developments and customer requirements  or any significant delays in product development or introduction  may have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
in addition  the introduction of new products may require significant expenditures for research and development  tooling  manufacturing processes  inventory and marketing 
in order to achieve high volume production of any new product  we may have to make substantial investments in inventory and expand our production capabilities 
dependence on major customers the economic strength and weakness of our worldwide customers affect our performance 
we sell our wireless control products  av accessory products  and proprietary technologies to subscription broadcasters  original equipment manufacturers  and private label customers 
we also supply our products to our wholly owned  non us subsidiaries and to independent foreign distributors  who in turn distribute our products worldwide  with europe and asia currently representing our principal foreign markets 
during the year ended december   we had sales to sony and its sub contractors and to directv and its sub contractors  that when combined  each totaled or more of our net sales 
in each of the year ended december  and  we had sales to directv and its sub contractors and to comcast and its sub contractors  that when combined  each exceeded of our net sales 
the loss of any of these customers or of any other key customer  either in the united states or abroad or our inability to maintain order volume with these customers  may have an adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 

table of contents change in warranty claim costs we rely on third party companies to service a large portion of our customer warranty claims 
if the cost to service these warranty claims increases unexpectedly  or these outside services cease to be available  we may be required to increase our estimate of future claim costs  which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
outsourced labor we employ a small number of personnel to develop and market additional products that are part of the nevo platform as well as products that are based on the zigbee  z wave and other radio frequency technology 
even after these hires  we continue to use outside resources to assist us in the development of these products 
while we believe that such outside services will continue to be available to us  if they cease to be available  the development of these products may be substantially delayed  which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
competition competition with the wireless control industry is based primarily on product availability  price  speed of delivery  ability to tailor specific solutions to customer needs  quality  and depth of product lines 
our competition is fragmented across our products  and  accordingly  we do not compete with any one company across all product lines 
we compete with a variety of entities  some of which have greater financial resources 
our ability to remain competitive in this industry depends in part on our ability to successfully identify new product opportunities  develop and introduce new products and enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis  as well as our ability to successfully identify and enter into strategic alliances with entities doing business within the industries we serve 
there can be no assurance that our product offerings will be  and or remain  competitive or that strategic alliances  if any  will achieve the type  extent  and amount of success or business that we expect them to achieve 
the sales of our products and technology may not occur or grow in the manner we expect  and thus we may not recoup costs incurred in the research and development of these products as quickly as we expect  if at all 
patents  trademarks  and copyrights the procedures by which we identify  document and file for patent  trademark  and copyright protection are based solely on engineering and management judgment  with no assurance that a specific filing will be issued  or if issued  will deliver any lasting value to us 
because of the rapid innovation of products and technologies that is characteristic of our industry  there can be no assurance that rights granted under any patent will provide competitive advantages to us or will be adequate to safeguard and maintain our proprietary rights 
moreover  the laws of certain countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold may not offer protection on such products and associated intellectual property to the same extent that the united states legal system may offer 
in our opinion  our intellectual property holdings as well as our engineering  production  and marketing skills and the experience of our personnel are of equal importance to our market position 
we further believe that none of our businesses are materially dependent upon any single patent  copyright  trademark  or trade secret 
some of our products include or use technology and or components of third parties 
while it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of such products  we believe that  based upon past experience and industry practice  such licenses may be obtained on commercially reasonable terms  however  there can be no guarantee that such licenses may be obtained on such terms or at all 
because of technological changes in the wireless and home control industry  current extensive patent coverage  and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents  it is possible certain components of our products and business methods may unknowingly infringe upon the patents of others 
potential for litigation as is typical in our industry and for the nature and kind of business in which we are engaged  from time to time various claims  charges and litigation are asserted or commenced by third parties against us or by us against third parties  arising from or related to product liability  infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights  breach of warranty  contractual relations or employee relations 
the amounts claimed may be substantial  but they may not bear any reasonable relationship to the merits of the claims or the extent of any real risk of court awards assessed against us or in our favor 

table of contents risks of conducting business internationally risks of doing business internationally may adversely affect our sales  operations  earnings and cash flows due to a variety of factors  including  but not limited to changes in a country or region s economic or political conditions  including inflation  recession  interest rate fluctuations  forced political actions or elections  coops  and actual or anticipated military conflicts  currency fluctuations affecting sales  particularly in the euro  british pound the chinese yuan renminbi  indian rupee  singapore dollar  and the brazilian real which contribute to variations in sales of products and services in impacted jurisdictions and also affect our reported results expressed in us dollars  currency fluctuations affecting costs  particularly the euro  british pound the chinese yuan renminbi  indian rupee  singapore dollar  and the brazilian real which contribute to variances in costs in impacted jurisdictions and also affect our reported results expressed in us dollars  longer accounts receivable cycles and financial instability among customers  trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting production  pricing and marketing of products  local labor conditions  customs  and regulations  changes in the regulatory or legal environment  differing technology standards or customer requirements  import  export or other business licensing requirements or requirements related to making foreign direct investments  which may affect our ability to obtain favorable terms for components or lead to penalties or restrictions  difficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad in a tax efficient manner and changes in tax laws  and fluctuations in freight costs and disruptions at important geographic points of exit and entry 
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  we are required to include in our annual report on form k our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
furthermore  our independent registered public accounting firm is required to audit our internal control over financial reporting and separately report on whether it believes we maintain  in all material respects  effective internal control over financial reporting 
although we believe that we currently have adequate internal control procedures in place  we cannot be certain that future material changes to our internal control over financial reporting will be effective 
if we cannot adequately maintain the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting  we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities  such as the securities and exchange commission 
any such action may adversely affect our financial results and the market price of our common stock 
changes in generally accepted accounting principles our financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
these principles are subject to revision and interpretation by various governing bodies  including the fasb and the sec 
a change in current accounting standards or their interpretation may have a significant adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
unanticipated changes in tax provisions or income tax liabilities we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts we charge for inventory and other items in intercompany transactions 
from time to time  we are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions 
tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges or other matters and assess additional taxes 
we assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of the tax provision 
however  there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the 
table of contents outcomes of these audits  and the actual outcomes of these audits may have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  our effective tax rate in the future may be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates  changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities  changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process 
furthermore  our tax provisions may be adversely affected as a result of any new interpretative accounting guidance related to accounting for uncertain tax positions 
inability to use deferred tax assets we have deferred tax assets that we may not be able to use under certain circumstances 
if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions  or if there is a significant change in the actual effective tax rates or a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  we may be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets resulting in an increase in our effective tax rate 
environmental matters many of our products are subject to various federal  state  local and international laws governing chemical substances in products  including laws regulating the manufacture and distribution of chemical substances and restricting the presence of certain substances in electronics products 
in addition  many of these laws and regulations make producers of electrical goods responsible for collection  recycling  treatment and disposal of recovered products 
as a result  we may face significant costs and liabilities in complying with these laws and any future laws and regulations or enforcement policies that may have a material adverse effect upon our operating results  financial condition  and cash flows 
leased property we lease all of the properties used in our business 
we can give no assurance that we will enter into new or renewal leases  or that  if entered into  the new lease terms will be similar to the existing terms or that the terms of any such new or renewal leases will not have a significant and material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
technology changes in wireless control we currently derive substantial revenue from the sale of wireless remote controls based on ir and rf technology 
other control technologies exist or may be developed that may compete with this technology 
in addition  we develop and maintain our own database of ir and rf codes 
there are competing ir and rf libraries offered by companies that we compete with in the marketplace 
the advantage that we may have compared to our competitors is difficult to measure 
in addition  if other wireless control technology gains acceptance and starts to be integrated into home electronics devices currently controlled through our ir remote controllers  demand for our products may decrease  resulting in decreased operating results  financial condition  and cash flows 
failure to recruit  hire  and retain key personnel our ability to achieve growth in the future will depend  in part  on our success at recruiting  hiring  and retaining highly skilled engineering  managerial  operational  sales and marketing personnel 
if our salary and benefits fail to stay competitive it may negatively impact our ability to hire and retain key personnel 
the inability to recruit  hire  and retain qualified personnel in a timely manner  or the loss of any key personnel  may make it difficult to meet key objectives  such as timely and effective product introductions 
change in competition and pricing even after our recent acquisition of the prc factories  we will continue to rely on third party manufacturers to build our universal wireless control products 
price is always an issue in winning and retaining business 
if customers become increasingly price sensitive  new competition may arise from manufacturers who decide to go into direct competition with us or from current competitors who perform their own manufacturing 
if such a trend develops  we may experience downward pressure on our pricing or lose sales  which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 

table of contents transportation costs  impact of oil prices we ship products from our foreign manufacturers via ocean and air transport 
it is sometimes difficult to forecast swings in demand or delays in production and  as a result  products may be shipped via air which is more costly than ocean shipments 
we typically cannot recover the increased cost of air freight from our customers 
additionally  tariffs and other export fees may be incurred to ship products from foreign manufacturers to the customer 
the inability to predict swings in demand or delays in production may increase the cost of freight which may have a material adverse effect on our product margins 
in addition  we have an exposure to oil prices due to the use of oil based materials in our products  which are primarily the plastics and other components that we include in our finished products  the cost of delivery and freight  which would be passed on by the carriers that we use in the form of higher rates  political unrest in oil producing countries that could cause a cessation of production and or delivery of oil resulting in higher costs 
we record freight in as a cost of sales and freight out in operating expenses 
rising oil prices may have an adverse effect on cost of sales and operating expenses 
proprietary technologies we produce highly complex products that incorporate leading edge technology  including hardware  firmware  and software 
firmware and software may contain bugs that may unexpectedly interfere with product operation 
there can be no assurance that our testing programs will detect all defects in individual products or defects that may affect numerous shipments 
the presence of defects may harm customer satisfaction  reduce sales opportunities  or increase returns 
an inability to cure or repair such a defect may result in the failure of a product line  temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market  damage to our reputation  increased inventory costs  or product reengineering expenses  any of which may have a material impact on our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
strategic business transactions we may  from time to time  pursue strategic alliances  joint ventures  business acquisitions  products or technologies strategic business transactions that complement or expand our existing operations  including those that may be material in size and scope 
strategic business transactions involve many risks  including the diversion of management s attention away from day to day operations 
there is also the risk that we will not be able to successfully integrate the strategic business transaction with our operations  personnel  customer base  products or technologies 
such strategic business transactions may also have adverse short term effects on our operating results  and may result in dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt  and the loss of key employees 
in addition  these strategic business transactions are subject to specific accounting guidelines that may adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
for instance  business acquisitions must be accounted for as purchases and  because most technology related acquisitions involve the purchase of significant intangible assets  these acquisitions typically result in substantial amortization charges  which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
there can be no assurance that any such strategic business transactions will occur or  if such transactions do occur  that the integration will be successful or that the customer bases  products or technologies will generate sufficient revenue to offset the associated costs or effects 
growth projections management has made the projections required for the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america regarding future events and the financial performance of the company  including those involving the benefits the company expects as a result of the development and success of products and technologies  including new products and technologies  the benefits expected by entering into emerging markets such as asia and brazil  without which  we may not be able to recover the costs we incur to enter into such markets  the recently announced new contracts with new and existing customers and new market penetrations  the expected continued growth in digital tvs  dvrs  pvrs and overall growth in the company s industry  and the effects we may experience due to the continued softness in worldwide markets driven by the current economic environment
