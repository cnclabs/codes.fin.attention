item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cautionary note regarding forward looking statements  as well as risks included elsewhere in our documents filed with the sec  before investing in any of our securities 
we may amend  supplement or add to the risk factors described below from time to time in future reports filed with the sec 
risks relating to our business if we are unable to implement our business strategies  our business and financial condition may be adversely affected 
our future results of operations will depend in significant part on the extent to which we can implement our business strategies successfully  including our ability to realize the anticipated growth opportunities  expanded market visibility and increased access to capital 
our business strategies include continuing to operate our portfolio of run off insurance and reinsurance companies and related management engagements  as well as pursuing additional acquisitions and management engagements in the run off segment of the insurance and reinsurance market 
we may not be able to implement our strategies fully or realize the anticipated results of our strategies as a result of significant business  economic and competitive uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control 
the effects of emerging claims and coverage issues may result in increased provisions for loss reserves and reduced profitability in our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries 
such adverse business issues may also reduce the level of incentive based fees generated by our consulting operations 
adverse global economic conditions  such as rising interest rates and volatile foreign exchange rates  may cause widespread failure of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries reinsurers to satisfy their obligations  as well as failure of companies to meet their obligations under debt instruments held by our subsidiaries 
if the run off industry becomes more attractive to investors  competition for runoff acquisitions and management and consultancy engagements may increase and  therefore  reduce our ability to continue to make profitable acquisitions or expand our consultancy operations 
if we are unable to successfully implement our business strategies  we may not be able to achieve future growth in our earnings and our financial condition may suffer and  as a result  holders of our ordinary shares may receive lower returns 
we may require additional capital in the future that may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms 
our future capital requirements depend on many factors  including our ability to manage the run off of our assumed policies and to establish reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses 
we may need to raise additional funds through financings in the future 
any equity or debt financing  if available at all  may be on terms that are not favorable to us 
in the case of equity financings  dilution to our existing shareholders could result  and any securities that are part of such equity financing  may have rights  preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our already outstanding securities 
if we cannot obtain adequate capital  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by  among other things  our inability to finance future acquisitions 
our inability to successfully manage our portfolio of insurance and reinsurance companies in run off may adversely impact our ability to grow our business and may result in losses 
we were founded to acquire and manage insurance and reinsurance companies and portfolios of insurance and reinsurance in run off 
our run off business differs from the business of traditional insurance and reinsurance underwriting in that our companies and portfolios in run off no longer underwrite new policies and are subject to 
table of contents the risk that their stated provisions for losses and loss adjustment expense  or lae  will not be sufficient to cover future losses and the cost of run off 
because our companies and portfolios in run off no longer collect underwriting premiums  our sources of capital to cover losses are limited to our stated reserves  reinsurance coverage and retained earnings 
as of december   our gross reserves for losses and loss adjustment expense totaled billion  and our reinsurance receivables totaled billion 
in order for us to achieve positive operating results  we must first price acquisitions on favorable terms relative to the risks posed by the acquired businesses and then successfully manage the acquired businesses 
our inability to price acquisitions on favorable terms  efficiently manage claims  collect from reinsurers and control run off expenses could result in us having to cover losses sustained under assumed policies with retained earnings  which would materially and adversely impact our ability to grow our business and may result in material losses 
if our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries loss reserves are inadequate to cover their actual losses  our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries net income and capital and surplus would be reduced 
our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are required to maintain reserves to cover their estimated ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses for both reported and unreported incurred claims 
these reserves are only estimates of what our subsidiaries consider the settlement and administration of claims will cost based on facts and circumstances known to the subsidiaries 
our commutation activity and claims settlement and development in recent years has resulted in net reductions in provisions for loss and loss adjustment expenses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
although this recent experience indicates that our loss reserves have been more than adequate to meet our liabilities  because of the uncertainties that surround estimating loss reserves and loss adjustment expenses  our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries cannot be certain that ultimate losses will not exceed these estimates of losses and loss adjustment expenses 
if our subsidiaries reserves are insufficient to cover their actual losses and loss adjustment expenses  our subsidiaries would have to augment their reserves and incur a charge to their earnings 
these charges could be material and would reduce our net income and capital and surplus 
the difficulty in estimating the subsidiaries reserves is increased because our subsidiaries loss reserves include reserves for potential asbestos and environmental  or a e  liabilities 
at december   our insurance and reinsurance companies had recorded gross a e loss reserves of million  or of the total gross loss reserves 
net a e loss reserves at december  amounted to million  or of total net loss reserves 
a e liabilities are especially hard to estimate for many reasons  including the long waiting periods between exposure and manifestation of any bodily injury or property damage  the difficulty in identifying the source of the asbestos or environmental contamination  long reporting delays and the difficulty in properly allocating liability for the asbestos or environmental damage 
developed case law and adequate claim history do not always exist for such claims  especially because significant uncertainty exists about the outcome of coverage litigation and whether past claim experience will be representative of future claim experience 
in view of the changes in the legal and tort environment that affect the development of such claims  the uncertainties inherent in valuing a e claims are not likely to be resolved in the near future 
ultimate values for such claims cannot be estimated using traditional reserving techniques and there are significant uncertainties in estimating the amount of our subsidiaries potential losses for these claims 
our subsidiaries have not made any changes in reserve estimates that might arise as a result of any proposed us federal legislation related to asbestos 
to further understand this risk  see business reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense on page our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries reinsurers may not satisfy their obligations to our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries 
our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are subject to credit risk with respect to their reinsurers because the transfer of risk to a reinsurer does not relieve our subsidiaries of their liability to the insured 
in addition  
table of contents reinsurers may be unwilling to pay our subsidiaries even though they are able to do so 
as of december   the balances receivable from reinsurers amounted to billion  of which million was associated with one reinsurer which represented or more of total reinsurance balances receivable 
the reinsurer had a credit rating  as provided by a major rating agency  of a 
of the million receivable from the reinsurer  million is secured by a trust fund held for our benefit 
in addition  many reinsurance companies have been negatively impacted by the deteriorating financial and economic conditions  including unprecedented financial market disruption 
a number of these companies  including some of those with which we conduct business  have been downgraded and or have been placed on negative outlook by various rating agencies 
the failure of one or more of our subsidiaries reinsurers to honor their obligations in a timely fashion may affect our cash flows  reduce our net income or cause us to incur a significant loss 
disputes with our reinsurers may also result in unforeseen expenses relating to litigation or arbitration proceedings 
the value of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries investment portfolios and the investment income that our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries receive from these portfolios may decline as a result of market fluctuations and economic conditions 
we derive a significant portion of our income from our invested assets 
the net investment income that our subsidiaries realize from investments in fixed maturity securities will generally increase or decrease with interest rates 
the fair market value of our subsidiaries fixed maturity securities generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates and can also decrease as a result of any downturn in the business cycle that causes the credit quality of those securities to deteriorate 
the fair market value of our subsidiaries fixed maturity securities classified as trading or available for sale in our subsidiaries investment portfolios amounted to billion at december  the changes in the market value of our subsidiaries securities that are classified as trading or available for sale are reflected in our financial statements 
permanent impairments in the value of our subsidiaries fixed maturity securities are also reflected in our financial statements 
as a result  a decline in the value of the securities in our subsidiaries investment portfolios may reduce our net income or cause us to incur a loss 
in addition to fixed maturity securities  we have invested  and may from time to time continue to invest  in private equities  equities and bond and hedge funds 
these and other similar investments may be illiquid and have different risk characteristics than our investments in fixed maturity securities 
as of december   we had an aggregate of million of such investments 
for more information  see business investment portfolio on page uncertain conditions in the economy generally may materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in the event of financial turmoil affecting the global banking system and financial markets including the sovereign debt markets  additional consolidation of the financial services industry  or significant financial service institution failures  there could be a new or incremental tightening in the credit markets  low liquidity  and extreme volatility in fixed income  credit  currency  and equity markets 
this could have a number of effects on our business  including our ability to obtain financing for future acquisitions 
even if financing is available  it may only be available at an unattractive cost of capital  which would decrease our profitability 
net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains or losses also could vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments  impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity securities and other investments  interest rates  cash balances  and changes in the fair value of derivative instruments 
increased volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty would increase the risk of the actual amounts realized in the future on our financial instruments differing significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them 

table of contents in addition  recent rating agency downgrades of the us government s credit rating and the credit ratings of certain european countries reflect a growing concern of the potential default of government issuers and have created broader financial turmoil and uncertainty  which has weighed heavily on the global banking system 
therefore  these recent downgrades and any future downgrades of the us government s credit rating and the credit ratings of one or more european countries  may materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations  including the return on and value of our investments 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates may cause us to experience losses 
we maintain a portion of our investments  insurance liabilities and insurance assets denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
consequently  we and our subsidiaries may experience foreign exchange losses 
we publish our consolidated financial statements in us dollars 
therefore  fluctuations in exchange rates used to convert other currencies  particularly australian dollars  euros  british pounds and other european currencies  into us dollars will impact our reported consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows from year to year 
we have made  and expect to continue to make  strategic acquisitions of insurance and reinsurance companies in run off  and these activities may not be financially beneficial to us or our shareholders 
we have pursued and  as part of our strategy  we will continue to pursue growth through acquisitions and or strategic investments in insurance and reinsurance companies in run off 
we have made acquisitions and several investments and we expect to continue to make such acquisitions and investments 
we cannot be certain that any of these acquisitions or investments will be financially advantageous for us or our shareholders 
the negotiation of potential acquisitions or strategic investments  as well as the integration of an acquired business or portfolio  could result in a substantial diversion of management resources 
acquisitions could involve numerous additional risks such as potential losses from unanticipated litigation or levels of claims  an inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition costs and financial exposures in the event that the sellers of the entities we acquire are unable or unwilling to meet their indemnification  reinsurance and other obligations to us 
our ability to manage our growth through acquisitions or strategic investments will depend  in part  on our success in addressing these risks 
any failure by us to effectively implement our acquisition or strategic investment strategies could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our past and future acquisitions may expose us to operational risks such as cash flow shortages  challenges to recruit appropriate levels of personnel  financial exposures to foreign currencies  additional integration costs and management time and effort 
we have made acquisitions of insurance and reinsurance businesses in run off and entered into acquisitions of portfolios of insurance and reinsurance businesses in run off  and we may in the future make additional strategic acquisitions 
these acquisitions may expose us to operational challenges and risks  including funding cash flow shortages that may occur if anticipated revenues are not realized or are delayed  whether by general economic or market conditions or unforeseen internal difficulties  funding cash flow shortages that may occur if expenses are greater than anticipated  the value of assets being lower than expected or diminishing because of credit defaults or changes in interest rates  or liabilities assumed or acquired being greater than expected  integrating financial and operational reporting systems  including assurance of compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of and our exchange act reporting requirements  establishing satisfactory budgetary and other financial controls  funding increased capital needs and overhead expenses  
table of contents obtaining management personnel required for expanded operations  and the assets and liabilities we may acquire may be subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation 
our failure to manage successfully these operational challenges and risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
fluctuations in the reinsurance industry may cause our operating results to fluctuate 
the reinsurance industry historically has been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties 
factors that affect the industry in general may also cause our operating results to fluctuate 
the industry s profitability may be affected significantly by fluctuations in interest rates  inflationary pressures and other changes in the investment environment  which affect returns on invested capital and may affect the ultimate payout of loss amounts and the costs of administering books of reinsurance business  volatile and unpredictable developments  such as those that have occurred recently in the world wide financial and credit markets  which may adversely affect the recoverability of reinsurance from our reinsurers  changes in reserves resulting from different types of claims that may arise and the development of judicial interpretations relating to the scope of insurers liability  and the overall level of economic activity and the competitive environment in the industry 
the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain 
as industry practices and legal  judicial  social and other environmental conditions change  unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge 
these issues may adversely affect the adequacy of our provision for losses and loss adjustment expenses by either extending coverage beyond the intent of insurance policies and reinsurance contracts envisioned at the time they were written  or by increasing the number or size of claims 
in some instances  these changes may not become apparent until some time after we have acquired companies or portfolios of insurance or reinsurance contracts that are affected by the changes 
as a result  the full extent of liability under these insurance or reinsurance contracts may not be known for many years after a contract has been issued 
to further understand this risk  see business reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense on page insurance laws and regulations restrict our ability to operate  and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations  or any investigations by government authorities  may have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are subject to extensive regulation under insurance laws and regulations of a number of jurisdictions 
compliance with legal and regulatory requirements is expensive 
existing laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that can be paid to us by our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries  prescribe solvency and capital adequacy standards that they must meet and maintain  impose restrictions on the amount and type of investments that they can hold to meet solvency and capital adequacy requirements and require them to maintain reserve liabilities 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may subject our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries to fines and penalties  restrict them from conducting business or result in commencement of insurance company delinquency proceedings against a non compliant insurance or reinsurance subsidiary 
the application of these laws and regulations may affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends on our ordinary shares and may restrict our ability to expand our business operations through acquisitions 
at december   the required statutory capital and surplus of our insurance and reinsurance companies amounted to million compared to the actual statutory capital and surplus of billion 
as of december   million of our total investments of billion were not admissible for statutory solvency purposes 
additional laws and regulations may be enacted in the wake of the recent or future financial and credit crises that 
table of contents may have adverse effects on our business  potentially including a change in the united states from a state based system of regulation to a system of federal regulation and or measures under the dodd frank act 
among other things  the dodd frank act established the financial services oversight council  which is authorized to require supervision of certain significant non bank financial companies  including insurance companies  by the board of governors of the federal reserve 
to further understand these risks  see business regulation beginning on page the insurance and reinsurance industry has experienced substantial volatility as a result of current investigations  litigation and regulatory activity by various insurance  governmental and enforcement authorities  including the sec  concerning certain practices within the insurance and reinsurance industry 
these practices include the sale and purchase of finite reinsurance or other non traditional or loss mitigation insurance products and the accounting treatment for those products 
insurance and reinsurance companies that we have acquired  or may acquire in the future  may have been or may become involved in these investigations and have lawsuits filed against them 
our involvement in any investigations and related lawsuits would cause us to incur legal costs and  if we or any of our insurance or reinsurance subsidiaries were found to have violated any laws  we could be required to pay fines and damages  perhaps in material amounts 
if we fail to comply with applicable insurance laws and regulations  we may be subject to disciplinary action  damages  penalties or restrictions that may have a material adverse effect on our business 
our subsidiaries may not have maintained or be able to maintain all required licenses and approvals or maintained or be able to maintain their businesses in full compliance with the laws and regulations to which they are subject  or the relevant insurance regulatory authority s interpretation of those laws and regulations 
in addition  some regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant  renew or revoke licenses and approvals 
if our subsidiaries do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements  the insurance regulatory authorities may preclude or suspend our subsidiaries from carrying on some or all of their activities  place one of more of them into rehabilitation or liquidation proceedings  or impose monetary penalties on them 
these types of actions may have a material adverse effect on our business and may preclude us from making future acquisitions or obtaining future engagements to manage companies and portfolios in run off 
exit and finality opportunities provided by solvent schemes of arrangement may not continue to be available  which may result in the diversion of our resources to settle policyholder claims for a substantially longer run off period and increase the associated costs of run off of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries 
with respect to our uk  bermudian and australian insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries  we are able to pursue strategies to achieve complete finality and conclude the run off of a company by promoting solvent schemes of arrangement 
solvent schemes of arrangement have been a popular means of achieving financial certainty and finality for insurance and reinsurance companies incorporated or managed in the uk  bermuda and australia  by making a one time full and final settlement of an insurance and reinsurance company s liabilities to policyholders 
a solvent scheme of arrangement is an arrangement between a company and its creditors or any class of them 
for a solvent scheme of arrangement to become binding on the creditors  a meeting of each class of creditors must be called  with the permission of the local court  to consider and  if thought fit  approve the solvent scheme of arrangement 
the requisite statutory majority of creditors of not less than in value and in number of those creditors actually attending the meeting  either in person or by proxy  must vote in favor of a solvent scheme of arrangement 
once the solvent scheme of arrangement has been approved by the statutory majority of voting creditors of the company  it requires the sanction of the local court at a hearing at which creditors may appear 
the court must be satisfied that the scheme is fair  following a full consideration of the relevant evidence and of the scheme s individual merits 
should a solvent scheme of arrangement promoted by any of our insurance or reinsurance subsidiaries fail to receive the requisite approval by creditors or sanction by the court  we will have to run off these liabilities 
table of contents until expiry  which may result in the diversion of our resources to settle policyholder claims for a substantially longer run off period and increase the associated costs of run off  resulting potentially in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are dependent on our executive officers  directors and other key personnel and the loss of any of these individuals could adversely affect our business 
our success substantially depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees and upon the ability of our senior management and other key employees to implement our business strategy 
we believe that there are only a limited number of available qualified personnel in the business in which we compete 
we rely substantially upon the services of dominic f 
silvester  our chief executive officer  paul j 
o shea and nicholas a 
packer  our executive vice presidents and joint chief operating officers  richard j 
harris  our chief financial officer  and our subsidiaries executive officers and directors to identify and consummate the acquisition of insurance and reinsurance companies and portfolios in run off on favorable terms and to implement our run off strategy 
each of messrs 
silvester  o shea  packer and harris has an employment agreement with us 
the loss of the services of any of our management or other key personnel  or the loss of the services of or our relationships with any of our directors could have a material adverse effect on our business 
under bermuda law  non bermudians other than spouses of bermudians  holders of permanent resident s certificates or holders of a working resident s certificate may not engage in any gainful occupation in bermuda without an appropriate governmental work permit 
work permits may be granted or extended by the bermuda government upon showing that  after proper public advertisement in most cases  no bermudian or spouse of a bermudian  holder of a permanent resident s certificate or holders of a working resident s certificate is available who meets the minimum standard requirements for the advertised position 
the bermuda government s policy limits the duration of work permits to six years  with certain exemptions for key employees and job categories where there is a worldwide shortage of qualified employees 
as a result  if we were to lose any of our key employees the work permit laws and policies may hinder our ability to replace them 
conflicts of interest might prevent us from pursuing desirable investment and business opportunities 
our directors and executive officers may have ownership interests or other involvement with entities that could compete against us  either in the pursuit of acquisition targets or in general business operations 
on occasion  we have also participated in transactions in which one or more of our directors or executive officers had an interest 
in particular  we have invested in or with entities that are affiliates of or otherwise related to mr 
flowers  one of our largest shareholders and formerly a member of our board 
the interests of our directors and executive officers in such transactions or such entities may result in a conflict of interest for those directors and officers 
the independent members of our board of directors review any material transactions involving a conflict of interest and may take actions as may be deemed appropriate by them in the particular circumstances 
we may not be able to pursue all advantageous transactions that we would otherwise pursue in the absence of a conflict should our board of directors be unable to determine that any such transaction is on terms as favorable as we could otherwise obtain in the absence of a conflict 
we are a holding company  and we are dependent on the ability of our subsidiaries to distribute funds to us 
we are a holding company and conduct substantially all of our operations through subsidiaries 
our only significant assets are the capital stock of our subsidiaries 
as a holding company  we are dependent on distributions of funds from our subsidiaries to pay dividends  fund acquisitions or fulfill financial obligations in the normal course of our business 
our subsidiaries may not generate sufficient cash from operations to enable us to make dividend payments  acquire additional companies or insurance or reinsurance portfolios or fulfill other financial obligations 
the ability of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries to make distributions to us is limited by applicable insurance laws and regulations  and the ability of all of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us may be restricted by  among other things  other applicable laws and regulations and the terms of our subsidiaries bank loans 

table of contents risks relating to ownership of our ordinary shares our stock price may experience volatility  thereby causing a potential loss of value to our investors 
the market price for our ordinary shares may fluctuate substantially due to  among other things  the following factors announcements with respect to an acquisition or investment  changes in the value of our assets  our quarterly and annual operating results  sales  or the possibility or perception of future sales  by our existing shareholders  changes in general conditions in the economy and the insurance industry  the financial markets  and adverse press or news announcements 
a few significant shareholders may influence or control the direction of our business 
if the ownership of our ordinary shares continues to be highly concentrated  it may limit your ability and the ability of other shareholders to influence significant corporate decisions 
the interests of messrs 
silvester  flowers  packer and o shea  advisory research  inc  or advisory  beck mack oliver llc  or beck mack  and goldman  sachs co 
and its affiliates  or goldman sachs  may not be fully aligned with your interests  and this may lead to a strategy that is not in your best interest 
as of december   messrs 
silvester  flowers  packer and o shea  advisory  beck mack and goldman sachs beneficially owned approximately      and  respectively  of our outstanding voting ordinary shares 
although they do not act as a group  advisory  beck mack  goldman sachs and each of messrs 
silvester  flowers  packer and o shea exercise significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval  and their concentrated holdings may delay or deter possible changes in control of enstar  which may reduce the market price of our ordinary shares 
for further information on aspects of our bye laws that may discourage changes of control of enstar  see some aspects of our corporate structure may discourage third party takeovers and other transactions or prevent the removal of our board of directors and management below 
some aspects of our corporate structure may discourage third party takeovers and other transactions or prevent the removal of our board of directors and management 
some provisions of our bye laws have the effect of making more difficult or discouraging unsolicited takeover bids from third parties or preventing the removal of our current board of directors and management 
in particular  our bye laws make it difficult for any us shareholder or direct foreign shareholder group a shareholder or group of commonly controlled shareholders of enstar that are not us persons to own or control ordinary shares that constitute or more of the voting power of all of our ordinary shares 
the votes conferred by such shares will be reduced by whatever amount is necessary so that after any such reduction the votes conferred by such shares will constitute of the total voting power of all ordinary shares entitled to vote generally 
the primary purpose of this restriction is to reduce the likelihood that we will be deemed a controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of internal revenue code of  as amended  or the code  for us federal tax purposes 
however  this limit may also have the effect of deterring purchases of large blocks of our ordinary shares or proposals to acquire us  even if some or a majority of our shareholders might deem these purchases or acquisition proposals to be in their best interests 
in addition  our bye laws provide for a classified board  whose members may be removed by our shareholders only for cause by a majority vote  and contain restrictions on the ability of shareholders to nominate persons to serve as directors  submit resolutions to a shareholder vote and request special general meetings 

table of contents these bye law provisions make it more difficult to acquire control of us by means of a tender offer  open market purchase  proxy contest or otherwise 
these provisions may encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to negotiate with our directors  which we believe would generally best serve the interests of our shareholders 
however  these provisions may have the effect of discouraging a prospective acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us 
in addition  these bye law provisions may prevent the removal of our current board of directors and management 
to the extent these provisions discourage takeover attempts  they may deprive shareholders of opportunities to realize takeover premiums for their shares or may depress the market price of the shares 
the market value of our ordinary shares may decline if large numbers of shares are sold  including pursuant to existing registration rights 
we have entered into a registration rights agreement with mr 
flowers and mr 
silvester and certain other of our shareholders 
this agreement provides that mr 
flowers and mr 
silvester may request that we effect a registration under the securities act of certain of their ordinary shares 
in addition  they and the other shareholders party to the agreement have piggyback registration rights  which may result in their participation in an offering initiated by us 
we have also entered into a registration rights agreement with the purchasers in connection with our private placement in  which provides that at any time following april   the purchasers may make two requests that we effect a registration under the securities act of the ordinary shares and non voting ordinary shares issued to them in the private placement 
the purchasers also have piggyback registration rights with respect to our registration of ordinary shares for our own account or for the account of one or more of our shareholders 
as of december   an aggregate of approximately million ordinary shares held by mr 
flowers and mr 
silvester and approximately  ordinary shares and million non voting ordinary shares held by the purchasers are subject to these agreements 
by exercising their registration rights  these holders could cause a large number of ordinary shares to be registered and generally become freely tradable without restrictions under the securities act immediately upon the effectiveness of the registration 
our ordinary shares have in the past been  and may from time to time continue to be  thinly traded  and significant sales  pursuant to the existing registration rights or otherwise  could adversely affect the market price for our ordinary shares and impair our ability to raise capital through offerings of our equity securities 
because we are incorporated in bermuda  it may be difficult for shareholders to serve process or enforce judgments against us or our directors and officers 
we are a bermuda company 
in addition  certain of our officers and directors reside in countries outside the united states 
all or a substantial portion of our assets and the assets of these officers and directors are or may be located outside the united states 
investors may have difficulty effecting service of process within the united states on our directors and officers who reside outside the united states or recovering against us or these directors and officers on judgments of us courts based on civil liabilities provisions of the us federal securities laws even though we have appointed an agent in the united states to receive service of process 
further  no claim may be brought in bermuda against us or our directors and officers for violation of us federal securities laws  as such laws do not have force of law in bermuda 
a bermuda court may  however  impose civil liability  including the possibility of monetary damages  on us or our directors and officers if the facts alleged in a complaint constitute or give rise to a cause of action under bermuda law 
we believe that there is doubt as to whether the courts of bermuda would enforce judgments of us courts obtained in actions against us or our directors and officers  as well as our independent auditors  predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws or original actions brought in bermuda against us or these persons predicated solely upon us federal securities laws 
further  there is no treaty in effect between the united states and bermuda providing for the enforcement of judgments of us courts  and there are grounds upon which bermuda courts may not enforce judgments of us courts 

table of contents some remedies available under the laws of us jurisdictions  including some remedies available under the us federal securities laws  may not be allowed in bermuda courts as contrary to that jurisdiction s public policy 
because judgments of us courts are not automatically enforceable in bermuda  it may be difficult for you to recover against us based upon such judgments 
shareholders who own our ordinary shares may have more difficulty in protecting their interests than shareholders of a us corporation 
the bermuda companies act  or the companies act  which applies to us  differs in certain material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and their shareholders 
as a result of these differences  shareholders who own our shares may have more difficulty protecting their interests than shareholders who own shares of a us corporation 
for example  class actions and derivative actions are generally not available to shareholders under bermuda law 
under bermuda law  only shareholders holding or more of our outstanding ordinary shares or numbering or more are entitled to propose a resolution at our general meeting 
we do not intend to pay cash dividends on our ordinary shares 
we do not intend to pay a cash dividend on our ordinary shares 
rather  we intend to use any retained earnings to fund the development and growth of our business 
from time to time  our board of directors will review our alternatives with respect to our earnings and seek to maximize value for our shareholders 
in the future  we may decide to commence a dividend program for the benefit of our shareholders 
any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be limited by our position as a holding company that lacks direct operations  the results of operations of our subsidiaries  our financial condition  cash requirements and prospects and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant 
in addition  there are significant regulatory and other constraints that could prevent us from paying dividends in any event 
as a result  capital appreciation  if any  on our ordinary shares may be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future 
our board of directors may decline to register a transfer of our ordinary shares under certain circumstances 
our board of directors may decline to register a transfer of ordinary shares under certain circumstances  including if it has reason to believe that any non de minimis adverse tax  regulatory or legal consequences to us  any of our subsidiaries or any of our shareholders may occur as a result of such transfer 
further  our bye laws provide us with the option to repurchase  or to assign to a third party the right to purchase  the minimum number of shares necessary to eliminate any such non de minimis adverse tax  regulatory or legal consequence 
in addition  our board of directors may decline to approve or register a transfer of shares unless all applicable consents  authorizations  permissions or approvals of any governmental body or agency in bermuda  the united states or any other applicable jurisdiction required to be obtained prior to such transfer shall have been obtained 
the proposed transferor of any shares will be deemed to own those shares for dividend  voting and reporting purposes until a transfer of such shares has been registered on our shareholders register 
it is our understanding that while the precise form of the restrictions on transfer contained in our bye laws is untested  as a matter of general principle  restrictions on transfers are enforceable under bermuda law and are not uncommon 
these restrictions on transfer may also have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control 
risks relating to taxation we might incur unexpected us  us or australia tax liabilities if companies in our group that are incorporated outside those jurisdictions are determined to be carrying on a trade or business there 
we and a number of our subsidiaries are companies formed under the laws of bermuda or other jurisdictions that do not impose income taxes  it is our contemplation that these companies will not incur substantial income 
table of contents tax liabilities from their operations 
because the operations of these companies generally involve  or relate to  the insurance or reinsurance of risks that arise in higher tax jurisdictions  such as the united states  united kingdom and australia  it is possible that the taxing authorities in those jurisdictions may assert that the activities of one or more of these companies creates a sufficient nexus in that jurisdiction to subject the company to income tax there 
there are uncertainties in how the relevant rules apply to insurance businesses  and in our eligibility for favorable treatment under applicable tax treaties 
accordingly  it is possible that we could incur substantial unexpected tax liabilities 
us persons who own our ordinary shares might become subject to adverse us tax consequences as a result of related person insurance income  or rpii  if any  of our non us insurance company subsidiaries 
if the rpii rules of the code were to apply to us  a us person who owns our ordinary shares directly or indirectly through foreign entities on the last day of the taxable year would be required to include in income for us federal income tax purposes the shareholder s pro rata share of our non us subsidiaries rpii for the entire taxable year  determined as if that rpii were distributed proportionately to the us shareholders at that date regardless whether any actual distribution is made 
in addition  any rpii that is includible in the income of a us tax exempt organization would generally be treated as unrelated business taxable income 
although we and our subsidiaries intend to generally operate in a manner so as to qualify for certain exceptions to the rpii rules  there can be no assurance that these exceptions will be available 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that us persons who own our ordinary shares will not be required to recognize gross income inclusions attributable to rpii 
in addition  the rpii rules provide that if a shareholder who is a us person disposes of shares in a foreign insurance company that has rpii and in which us persons collectively own or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote  or the total value of the stock  any gain from the disposition will generally be treated as dividend income to the extent of the shareholder s share of the corporation s undistributed earnings and profits that were accumulated during the period that the shareholder owned the shares whether or not those earnings and profits are attributable to rpii 
such a shareholder would also be required to comply with certain reporting requirements  regardless of the amount of shares owned by the shareholder 
these rules should not apply to dispositions of our ordinary shares because we will not be directly engaged in the insurance business 
the rpii rules  however  have not been interpreted by the courts or the us internal revenue service  or the irs  and regulations interpreting the rpii rules exist only in proposed form 
accordingly  there is no assurance that our views as to the inapplicability of these rules to a disposition of our ordinary shares will be accepted by the irs or a court 
us persons who own our ordinary shares would be subject to adverse tax consequences if we or one or more of our non us subsidiaries were considered a passive foreign investment company  or pfic  for us federal income tax purposes 
we believe that we and our non us subsidiaries will not be pfics for us federal income purposes for the current year 
moreover  we do not expect to conduct our activities in a manner that will cause us or any of our non us subsidiaries to become a pfic in the future 
however  there can be no assurance that the irs will not challenge this position or that a court will not sustain such challenge 
accordingly  it is possible that we or one or more of our non us subsidiaries might be deemed a pfic by the irs or a court for the current year or any future year 
if we or one or more of our non us subsidiaries were a pfic  it could have material adverse tax consequences for an investor that is subject to us federal income taxation  including subjecting the investor to a substantial acceleration and or increase in tax liability 
there are currently no regulations regarding the application of the pfic provisions of the code to an insurance company  so the application of those provisions to insurance companies remains unclear in certain respects 

table of contents us persons who own percent or more of our shares may be subject to taxation under the controlled foreign corporation  or cfc  rules 
a us person that is a us shareholder of a non us corporation non us  a non us person who owns or is treated as owning at least of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote of the non us corporation that is a cfc for an uninterrupted period of days or more during a taxable year  that owns shares in the cfc directly or indirectly through non us entities on the last day of the cfc s taxable year  must include in its gross income for us federal income tax purposes its pro rata share of the cfc s subpart f income  even if the subpart f income is not distributed 
subpart f income of a non us insurance corporation typically includes foreign personal holding company income such as interest  dividends and other types of passive income  as well as insurance and reinsurance income including underwriting and investment income 
a non us corporation is considered a cfc if non us shareholders own directly  indirectly through non us entities or by attribution by application of the constructive ownership rules of section b of the code ie  constructively more than of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of that foreign corporation  or the total value of all stock of that foreign corporation 
for purposes of taking into account insurance income  a cfc also includes a non us insurance company in which more than of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock or more than of the total value of the stock is owned directly  indirectly through non us entities or constructively by non us shareholders on any day during the taxable year of such corporation  if the gross amount of premiums or other consideration for the reinsurance or the issuing of insurance exceeds of the gross amount of all premiums or other consideration in respect of all risks 
we believe that because of the dispersion of our share ownership  and provisions in our organizational documents that limit voting power  no us person including our subsidiary enstar usa  inc  which owns certain of our non voting shares should be treated as owning directly  indirectly through non us entities or constructively or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of our shares 
however  the irs could successfully challenge the effectiveness of these provisions in our organizational documents 
accordingly  no assurance can be given that a us person who owns our shares will not be characterized as a us shareholder 
changes in us federal income tax law could materially affect us or our shareholders 
legislation has been proposed on various occasions to eliminate perceived tax advantages of insurance companies that have legal domiciles outside the united states but have certain us connections 
for example  proposed legislation was introduced in congress in to disallow the deduction of reinsurance premiums paid by us companies to certain non us affiliates  although no such provision has been enacted to date 
it is possible that such legislation could be enacted or similar legislation could be introduced in and enacted by the current congress or future congresses and enactment of some version of such legislation  or other changes in us tax laws  regulations or interpretations thereof  could have an adverse impact on us or our shareholders

business overview we were formed in august under the laws of bermuda to acquire and manage insurance and reinsurance companies in run off and portfolios of insurance and reinsurance business in run off  and to provide management  consulting and other services to the insurance and reinsurance industry 
on january   we completed the merger  or the merger  of cwms subsidiary corp  a georgia corporation and our wholly owned subsidiary  with and into the enstar group  inc  a georgia corporation 
as a result of the merger  the enstar group  inc  renamed enstar usa  inc  is now our wholly owned subsidiary 
the enstar group  inc owned an approximate economic and a voting interest in us prior to the merger 
since our formation  we  through our subsidiaries  have completed acquisitions of insurance and reinsurance companies and acquisitions of portfolios of insurance and reinsurance business and are now administering those businesses in run off 
we operate our business internationally through our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries and our consulting subsidiaries in bermuda  the united kingdom  the united states  europe and australia 
we had a total of employees as at december  summary we completed the acquisitions of five insurance and reinsurance companies and two portfolios of insurance and reinsurance business  we repaid or paid down a number of our existing loan facilities and entered into two new bank loan facilities that remained outstanding as at december   and on april   we entered into an investment agreement with goldman sachs co 
and certain of its affiliates whereby we have issued an aggregate of  voting and non voting ordinary shares for proceeds of million 
results of operations net earnings attributable to enstar group limited of million  or per basic share and per diluted share  net investment income of million and net realized gains of million  and net reduction in ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense liabilities of million 

table of contents financial condition total cash and investments of billion  total assets of billion  reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses of billion and reinsurance balances receivable of billion  and total shareholders equity attributable to enstar group limited of billion and net book value of per basic share and per diluted share 
financial statement overview consulting fee income we generate consulting fees based on a combination of fixed and success based fee arrangements 
consulting income will vary from period to period depending on the timing of completion of success based fee arrangements 
success based fees are recorded when targets related to overall project completion or profitability goals are achieved 
net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains our net investment income is principally derived from interest earned primarily on cash and investments offset by investment management fees paid 
our investment portfolio currently consists of the following fixed maturity investments that are classified as both available for sale and trading and are carried at fair value  short term investments that are classified as both available for sale and trading and are carried at fair value  equities that are carried at fair value  and other investments that are accounted for at estimated fair values determined by our proportionate share of the net asset value of the investee reduced by any impairment charges 
our current investment strategy seeks to preserve principal and maintain liquidity while trying to maximize investment return through a high quality  diversified portfolio 
the volatility of claims and the effect they have on the amount of cash and investment balances  as well as the level of interest rates and other market factors  affect the return we are able to generate on our investment portfolio 
when we make a new acquisition we will often restructure the acquired investment portfolio  which may generate one time realized gains or losses 
net reduction in ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense liabilities our insurance related earnings are comprised primarily of reductions  or potential increases  of net ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense liabilities 
these liabilities are comprised of outstanding loss or case reserves  or olr  which represent management s best estimate of the likely settlement amount for known claims  less the portion that can be recovered from reinsurers  reserves for losses incurred but not reported  or ibnr reserves  which are reserves established by us for claims that are not yet reported but can reasonably be expected to have occurred based on industry information  management s experience and actuarial evaluation  less the portion that can be recovered from reinsurers  and reserves for unallocated loss adjustment expenses  which represent management s best estimate of the future costs to be incurred by us in managing the run off of claims liabilities not specific  or allocated  to individual claims or policies 
net ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense liabilities are reviewed by our management each quarter and by independent actuaries annually as of year end 
reserves reflect management s best estimate of the remaining 
table of contents unpaid portion of these liabilities 
prior period estimates of net ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense liabilities may change as our management considers the combined impact of commutations  policy buy backs  settlement of losses on carried reserves and the trend of incurred loss development compared to prior forecasts 
commutations provide an opportunity for us to exit exposures to entire policies with insureds and reinsureds at a discount to the previously estimated ultimate liability 
to the extent possible  our internal and external actuaries eliminate all prior historical loss development that relates to commuted exposures and apply their actuarial methodologies to the remaining aggregate exposures and revised historical loss development information to reassess estimates of ultimate liabilities 
policy buy backs provide an opportunity for us to settle individual policies and losses usually at a discount to carried advised loss reserves 
as part of our routine claims settlement operations  claims will settle at either below or above the carried advised loss reserve 
the impact of policy buy backs and the routine settlement of claims updates historical loss development information to which actuarial methodologies are applied  often resulting in revised estimates of ultimate liabilities 
our actuarial methodologies include industry benchmarking  which  under certain methodologies discussed further under critical accounting policies below  compares the trend of our loss development to that of the industry 
to the extent that the trend of our loss development compared to the industry changes in any period  it is likely to have an impact on the estimate of ultimate liabilities 
additionally  consolidated net reductions  or potential increases  in net ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense liabilities include reductions  or potential increases  in the provisions for future losses and loss adjustment expenses related to the current period s run off activity 
net reductions in net ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense liabilities are reported as negative expenses by us 
for more information on how the reserves are calculated  see critical accounting policies loss and loss adjustment expenses on page salaries and benefits we are a service based company and  as such  employee salaries and benefits are our largest expense 
we have experienced significant increases in our salaries and benefits expenses as we have grown our operations  and we expect that trend to continue if we are able to expand our operations successfully 
the enstar group limited equity incentive plan  or the equity incentive plan  and the enstar group limited annual incentive compensation plan  or the annual incentive plan  which are administered by the compensation committee of our board of directors  provide for the annual grant of bonus compensation to our officers and employees  including our senior executive officers 
bonus awards for each calendar year from through were determined based on our consolidated net after tax profits 
the compensation committee determines the amount of bonus awards in any calendar year  based on a percentage of our consolidated net after tax profits 
the percentage is unless the compensation committee exercises its discretion to change the percentage no later than days after our year end 
for the years ended december   and the percentage was left unchanged by the compensation committee 
the compensation committee determines  in its sole discretion  the amount of bonus awards payable to each participant 
bonus awards are payable in cash  ordinary shares or a combination of both 
ordinary shares issued in connection with a bonus award will be issued pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of the equity incentive plan 
for information on the awards made under both the annual and equity incentive plans for the years ended december   and  see note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   included in item of this annual report

foreign exchange gains losses our reporting currency is us dollars 
our functional currency is us dollars for all of our subsidiaries with the exception of gordian run off limited  or gordian  whose functional currency is australian dollars 
through our subsidiaries whose functional currency is the us dollar  we hold a variety of foreign us currency assets and liabilities  the principal exposures being euros  british pounds and australian dollars 
at each balance sheet date  recorded balances that are denominated in a currency other than us dollars are adjusted to reflect the current exchange rate 
revenue and expense items are translated into us dollars at average rates of exchange for the applicable period 
the resulting exchange gains or losses are included in our net earnings 
for gordian  whose functional currency is australian dollars  at each reporting period the balance sheet and income statement are translated at period end and average rates of exchange  respectively  with any foreign exchange gains or losses on translation recorded as a component of our accumulated other comprehensive income in the shareholders equity section of our balance sheet 
we seek to manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange  where possible  by broadly matching our foreign currency assets against our foreign currency liabilities and to selectively use foreign currency exchange contracts 
subject to regulatory constraints  the net assets of our subsidiaries are maintained in us dollars 
income tax expense recovery under current bermuda law  we and our bermuda subsidiaries are not required to pay taxes in bermuda on either income or capital gains 
these companies have received an undertaking from the bermuda government that  in the event of income or capital gains taxes being imposed  they will be exempted from such taxes until the year income taxes have been provided  in accordance with the provisions of the income taxes topic of fasb asc  on our operations in other jurisdictions which are subject to income tax 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations 
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
such temporary differences are due primarily to the tax basis discount on unpaid losses and loss expenses  net operating loss carryforwards  and certain investments 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets is recorded if it is more likely than not that all  or some portion  of the benefits related to deferred tax assets will not be realized 
at each balance sheet date  we assess the need to establish a valuation allowance that reduces the net deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that all  or some portion  of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the valuation allowance is based on all available information including projections of future us gaap taxable income from each tax paying component in each tax jurisdiction 
projections of future us gaap taxable income incorporate several assumptions of future business and operations that are likely to differ from actual experience 
we also  in accordance with the income taxes topic of fasb asc  record tax liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions

gain on bargain purchase gain on bargain purchase represents the excess of the fair value of businesses acquired by us over the cost of such businesses 
in accordance with the business combinations topic of fasb asc  or asc  this amount is recognized upon the acquisition of the businesses as part of income 
the fair values of the reinsurance assets and liabilities acquired are derived from probability weighted ranges of the associated projected cash flows  based on actuarially prepared information and our management s run off strategy 
any changes to the fair values resulting from changes in such information or strategy will be recognized when they occur 
critical accounting policies our primary objective in running off the operations of an acquired company or portfolio of insurance or reinsurance business is to effect an orderly and efficient settlement of all liabilities and assets and  in so doing  to strive to achieve savings in the settlement of such amounts in relation to the values implied by the purchase price of the transaction 
our run off process is led by disciplined management and includes the adjustment and settlement of valid claims  commutations of exposures  disciplined collection of reinsurance receivables  achievement of early finality of the acquired run off by way of solvent scheme of arrangement if available and imposition of strong financial and operational governance over acquired companies 

table of contents accounting for acquisitions the most significant liability and asset of an acquired company are typically the liability for loss and loss adjustment expenses and the asset related to any reinsurance recoverable on these liabilities that may be contractually due to the acquired entity 
the market for acquisition of run off companies is not sufficiently active and transparent to enable us to identify reliable  market exit values for acquired assets and liabilities 
accordingly  consistent with provisions of us gaap  we have developed internal models that we believe allow us to determine fair values that are reasonable proxies for market exit values 
we are familiar with the major participants in the acquisition run off market and believe that the key assumptions we make in valuing acquired assets and liabilities are consistent with the kinds of assumptions made by such market participants 
furthermore  in our negotiation of purchase price with sellers  it is frequently clear to us that other bidders in the market are using models and assumptions similar in nature to ours during the competitive bid process 
the majority of acquisitions are completed following a public tender process whereby the seller invites market participants to provide bids for the target acquisition 
we account for acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting  which requires that the acquirer record the assets and liabilities acquired at their estimated fair value 
the fair values of each of the reinsurance assets and liabilities acquired are derived from probability weighted ranges of the associated projected cash flows  based on actuarially prepared information and management s run off strategy 
our run off strategy  as well as that of other run off market participants  is expected to be different from the seller s as generally sellers are not specialized in running off insurance and reinsurance liabilities whereas we and other market participants do specialize in such run offs 
the key assumptions used by us and  we believe  by other run off market participants in the fair valuation of acquired companies are i the projected payout  timing and amounts of claims liabilities  ii the related projected timing and amount of reinsurance collections  iii a risk free discount rate  which is applied to determine the present value of the future cash flows  iv the estimated unallocated loss adjustment expenses to be incurred over the life of the run off  v the impact that any accelerated run off strategy may have on the adequacy of acquired bad debt provisions  and vi an appropriate risk margin 
the probability weighted projected cash flows of the acquired company are based on projected claims payouts provided by the seller predominantly in the form of the seller s most recent independent actuarial reserve report 
in the absence of the seller s actuarial reserve report  our independent actuaries will determine the estimated claims payout 
with respect to our uk  bermudian and australian insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries  we are able to pursue strategies to achieve complete finality and conclude the run off of a company by promoting solvent schemes of arrangement 
solvent schemes of arrangement are a popular means of achieving financial certainty and finality for insurance and reinsurance companies incorporated or managed in the uk  bermuda and australia by making a one time full and final settlement of an insurance or reinsurance company s liabilities to policyholders 
on acquisition of a uk  bermudian or australian company  the claims payout projection is weighted according to management s estimated probability of being able to complete a solvent scheme of arrangement 
to the extent that solvent schemes of arrangement are not available to an acquired company  no weighting is applied to the projected claims payout 
on acquisition  we make a provision for unallocated loss adjustment expense liabilities 
this provision considers the adequacy of the provision maintained and recorded by the seller in light of our run off strategy and estimated unallocated loss adjustment expenses to be incurred over the life of the acquired run off as projected by the seller s actuaries or  in their absence  our actuaries 
to the extent that our estimate of the total unallocated loss adjustment expense provision is different from the seller s  an adjustment will be made 
while it is our objective to accelerate the run off by completing commutations of assumed and ceded business which would have the effect of shortening the life  and therefore the cost  of the run off  the success of this strategy is far from certain 
therefore  the estimates of unallocated loss adjustment expenses are based on running off the 
table of contents liabilities and assets over the actuarially projected life of the run off  which we consider to be a prudent approach 
in those domiciles where solvent schemes of arrangement are available  management s estimates of the total unallocated loss adjustment expenses are probability weighted in accordance with the estimated time that a solvent scheme of arrangement could be completed  which has the effect of reducing the period of the run off and the related unallocated loss adjustment expenses 
for those acquisitions in domiciles where solvent schemes of arrangement are not available  the unallocated loss adjustment expenses are estimated over the projected life of the run off 
we believe that providing for unallocated loss adjustment expenses based on our run off strategy is appropriate in determining the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired in an acquisition of a run off company 
we believe that other participants in the run off acquisition marketplace factor into the price to pay for an acquisition the estimated cost of running off the acquired company based on how that participant expects to manage the assets and liabilities 
the difference between the carrying value of reserves acquired at the date of acquisition and the fair value is the fair value adjustment  or fva 
the fva is amortized over the estimated payout period and adjusted for accelerations on commutation settlements or any other new information or subsequent change in circumstances after the date of acquisition 
to the extent the actual payout experience after the acquisition is materially faster or slower than anticipated at the time of the acquisition  there is an adjustment to the estimated ultimate loss reserves  or there are changes in bad debt provisions or in estimates of future run off costs following accelerated payouts  then the amortization of the fva is accelerated or decelerated  as the case may be  to reflect such changes 
loss and loss adjustment expenses our primary objective in running off the operations of acquired companies and portfolios of insurance and reinsurance business in run off is to increase book value by settling loss reserves below their acquired fair value 
the earnings created in each acquired company or portfolio of insurance and reinsurance business  together with the related decrease in loss reserves  leads to a reduction in the capital required for each company  thereby providing the ability to distribute both earnings and excess capital to the parent company 
to the extent that the nature of the acquired loss reserves are conducive to commutation  our aim is to settle the majority of the acquired loss reserves within a timeframe of approximately to years from the date of acquisition 
to the extent that acquired reserves are not conducive to commutation  we will instead adopt a disciplined claims management approach to pay only valid claims on a timely basis and endeavor to reduce the level of acquired loss adjustment expense provisions by withdrawing  where appropriate  from existing litigation and otherwise streamlining claims handling procedures 
by adopting either of the above run off strategies  we would expect that over the targeted life of the run off  acquired ultimate loss reserves would settle below their recorded fair value  resulting in reductions in ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense liabilities 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will successfully implement our strategy 
at the beginning of each year we prepare our projections of potential ultimate reserve releases for the year based on the assumptions that each of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries achieves its commutation targets and that non commuted reserve development is better than that expected by our external actuaries 
for each commutation target  a settlement objective is estimated 
probability of success weightings and assumptions of ibnr to case reserve ratios are applied to provide an indication of potential ultimate reserve savings that may be achieved from the target commutations 
commutations of blocks of policies  along with disciplined claims management  have the potential to produce favorable claims development compared to established reserves 
for each newly acquired company  we determine a commutation strategy that broadly identifies commutation targets using the following criteria previous commutations completed by our existing insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries with policyholders of the newly acquired company  
table of contents nature of liabilities  size of incurred loss reserves  recent loss development history  and targets for claims audits 
once commutation targets are identified they are prioritized into target years of completion 
at the beginning of each year  the approach to commutation negotiations is determined by the commutation team  including claims and exposure analysis and broker account reconciliations 
on completion of this analysis  settlement parameters are set around incurred liabilities 
commutation discussions can take many months or even years to come to fruition 
commutation targets not completed in a particular year are re prioritized for the following year 
every commutation  irrespective of value  requires the approval of our chief financial officer or one of our two joint chief operating officers 
for each commutation settled within the guideline settlement parameters  there is an expectation that there will be a favorable impact on the ibnr reserve when the annual actuarial review is completed 
however  if a significant commutation is completed during the year  loss reserves will be adjusted in the corresponding quarter to reflect our best estimate of the impact

the reserve for ibnr net of reinsurance balances receivable accounted for  million  or  of our total net loss reserves at december  annual loss and loss adjustment reviews because a significant amount of time can lapse between the assumption of risk  the occurrence of a loss event  the reporting of the event to an insurance or reinsurance company and the ultimate payment of the claim on the loss event  the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is based largely upon estimates 
our management must use considerable judgment in the process of developing these estimates 
the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for property and casualty business includes amounts determined from loss reports on individual cases and amounts for ibnr reserves 
such reserves  including ibnr reserves  are estimated by management based upon loss reports received from ceding companies  supplemented by our own estimates of losses for which no ceding company loss reports have yet been received 
loss advices or reports from ceding companies are generally provided via the placing broker and comprise treaty statements  individual claims files  electronic messages and large loss advices or cash calls 
large loss advices and cash calls are provided to us as soon as practicable after an individual loss or claim is made or settled by the insured 
the remaining broker advices are issued monthly  quarterly or annually depending on the provisions of the individual policies or the ceding company s practice 
for certain direct insurance policies where the claims are managed by third party administrators tpa s and managing general agents mga s  loss bordereaux are received either monthly or quarterly depending on the arrangement with the tpa and mga 
we log all claims advices in our internal claims tracking system upon receipt from brokers and cedants 
each advice is then assigned to the appropriate internal claims adjuster 
our professional claims adjusters and lawyers have many years of experience specializing in each class of business that we manage and also have established authority and internal referral levels 
individual large claims are reviewed and approved by senior management 
every item in the claims tracking system is monitored and tracked from the date of receipt of documents to review by adjusters and management and subsequent recording by our internal operations team 
all loss reports are processed within three months of receipt with any items not processed during this period identified and flagged for review by senior management 
the accuracy and completeness of the loss reports is assessed during the claims adjusting process 
we also track where additional information is required for certain 
table of contents claims so that the exact status of all claims received can be monitored to ensure that additional requests and queries are tracked and acted upon 
by carrying out additional onsite audits for larger exposures by cedant for reinsurance or by policyholder for direct claims  we are able to test the accuracy of the figures in the actual underlying files and loss advices 
where we provide reinsurance or retrocession reinsurance protection  the process of claim advice from the direct insurer to the reinsurers and or retrocessionaires naturally involves more levels of communication  which inevitably creates delays or lags in the receipt of loss advice by the reinsurers retrocessionaires relative to the date of first advice to the direct insurer 
certain types of exposure  typically latent health exposures such as asbestos related claims  have inherently long reporting delays  in some cases many years  from the date a loss occurred to the manifestation and reporting of a claim and ultimately until the final settlement of the claim 
for asbestos and environmental exposures  our actuaries apply explicit time lag assumptions in their reserving methodologies 
this time lag varies by portfolio from one to five years depending on the relative mix of domicile  percentages of product mix of insurance  reinsurance and retrocessional reinsurance  primary insurance  excess reinsurance  reinsurance of direct and reinsurance of reinsurance within any given exposure category 
exposure portfolios written from a non us domicile are assumed to have a greater time lag than portfolios written from a us domicile 
portfolios with a larger proportion of reinsurance exposures are assumed to have a greater time lag than portfolios with a larger proportion of insurance exposures 
an industry wide weakness in cedant reporting affects the adequacy and accuracy of reserving for advised claims 
we attempt to mitigate this inherent weakness as follows i we closely monitor cedant loss reporting and  for those cedants identified as providing inadequate  untimely or unusual reporting of losses  we conduct  in accordance with the provisions of the insurance and reinsurance contracts  detailed claims audits at the insured s or reinsured s premises 
such claims audits have the benefit of validating advised claims  determining whether the cedant s loss reserving practices and reporting are adequate and identifying potential loss reserving issues of which our actuaries need to be made aware 
any required adjustments to advised claims reserves reported by cedants identified during the claims audits will be recorded as an adjustment to the advised case reserve 
ii onsite claims audits are often supplemented by further reviews by our internal and external legal advisors to determine the reasonableness of advised case reserves and  if considered necessary  an adjustment to the reported case reserve will be recorded 
iii our actuaries project expected paid and incurred loss development for each class of business  which is monitored on a quarterly basis 
should actual paid and incurred development differ significantly from the expected paid and incurred development  we will investigate the cause and  in conjunction with our actuaries  consider whether any adjustment to ultimate loss reserves is required 
our actuaries consider the quality of ceding company data as part of their ongoing evaluation of the liability for ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses  and the methodologies they select for estimating ultimate losses inherently compensate for potential weaknesses in this data  including weaknesses in loss reports provided by cedants 
we strive to apply the highest standards of discipline and professionalism to our claims adjusting  processing and settlement and disputes with cedants are rare 
however  we are from time to time involved in various disputes and legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our claims adjusting process 
the majority of the losses ceded to us are from the subscription insurance market where there are often many insurers and reinsurers underwriting each policy  and we often are involved in disputes commenced by other co insurers who act in unison with any litigation or dispute resolution controlled by the lead underwriter 
coverage disputes arise when the insured reinsured and insurer reinsurer cannot reach agreement as to the interpretation of the policy and or application of the policy to a claim 
most insurance and reinsurance policies contain dispute resolution clauses requiring arbitration or mediation 
in the absence of a contractual dispute resolution process  civil litigation would be commenced 
we aim to reach a commercially acceptable resolution to any dispute  using arbitration or 
table of contents litigation as a last resort 
we regularly monitor and provide internal reports on all disputes involving arbitration and litigation and engage external legal counsel to provide professional advice and assist with case management 
in establishing reserves  management includes amounts for ibnr reserves based on independent actuarial estimates of ultimate losses 
our independent actuaries employ generally accepted actuarial methodologies to estimate ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses and those estimates are reviewed by our management 
nearly all of our unpaid claims liabilities are considered to have a longtail claims payout 
gross loss reserves relate primarily to casualty exposures  including latent claims  of which approximately relate to asbestos and environmental  or a e  exposures 
within the annual loss reserve studies produced by our external actuaries  exposures for each subsidiary are separated into homogeneous reserving categories for the purpose of estimating ibnr 
each reserving category contains either direct insurance or assumed reinsurance reserves and groups relatively similar types of risks and exposures for example  asbestos  environmental  casualty  property and lines of business written for example  marine  aviation  non marine 
based on the exposure characteristics and the nature of available data for each individual reserving category  a number of methodologies are applied 
recorded reserves for each category are selected from the indications produced by the various methodologies after consideration of exposure characteristics  data limitations and strengths and weaknesses of each method applied 
this approach to estimating ibnr has been consistently adopted in the annual loss reserve studies for each period presented 
we review our external actuaries reports for consistency and appropriateness of methodology and assumptions  including assumptions of industry benchmarks  and discuss any concerns or changes with them 
our chief actuary and chief financial officer then consider the reasonableness of the reduction or increase in ultimate loss reserves that would result by amending loss reserves to the level recommended by our external actuaries  in light of actual loss development during the year using the following reports produced internally on a quarterly basis for each of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries gross  ceded and net incurred loss report this report provides  for each reporting period  the total including commuted policies gross  ceded and net incurred loss development for each company and a commentary on each company s loss development prepared by our chief actuary 
the report highlights the causes of any unusual or significant loss development activity including commutations and raises any concerns regarding the quality of the underlying reserve data 
actual versus expected gross incurred loss development report this report provides a summary  and commentary thereon  of each company s excluding companies or portfolios of business acquired in the current year non commuted incurred gross losses compared to the estimate of the development of non commuted incurred gross losses provided by our external actuaries at the beginning of the year as part of the prior year s reserving process 
commutations summary schedule this schedule summarizes all commutations completed during the year for all companies  and identifies the policyholder with which we commuted  the incurred losses settled by the commutation comprising outstanding unpaid losses and case reserves and the amount of the commutation settlement 
analysis of paid  incurred and ultimate losses this analysis for each company  and in the aggregate  provides a summary of the gross  ceded and net paid and incurred losses and the impact of applying our external actuaries recommended loss reserves 
this report  reviewed in conjunction with the previous reports  provides an analytical tool to review each company s incurred loss or gain and reduction in ibnr reserves to assess whether the ultimate reduction in loss reserves appears reasonable in light of known developments within each company 

table of contents the above reports provide our chief actuary and chief financial officer with the relevant information to determine whether loss development including commutations during the year has  for each company  been sufficiently favorable so as to warrant a reserve reduction of the level that would result by applying our external actuaries recommended reserve levels 
it is not possible to quantify how much of any reserve release specifically relates to commutations or favorable development of non commuted claims as the revised historical loss development used by the actuaries to estimate required reserves is a combination of both the elimination of historical loss development relating to commuted policies and non commuted loss development 
it is not practicable to determine the loss reserves that would be required relating to commuted policies as this would require an additional actuarial review each year for each company based on loss development statistics including the historical loss development for commuted policies 
should the conclusions of the chief actuary and chief financial officer differ from those implied by our external actuaries  the chief actuary will engage in further discussions with the external actuaries to understand the rationale behind their reserve recommendations 
when establishing loss reserves we have an expectation that  in the absence of commutations and significant favorable or unfavorable non commuted loss development compared to expectations  loss reserves will not exceed the high  or be less than the low  end of the following ranges of gross loss and loss adjustment expense reserves implied by the various methodologies used by each of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries 
the range of gross loss and loss adjustment expense reserves implied by the various methodologies used by each of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries as of december  was low selected high in thousands of us dollars asbestos environmental all other general casualty workers compensation personal accident marine  aviation and transit construction defect other total all other unallocated loss adjustment expenses total latent claims our loss reserves are related largely to casualty exposures including latent exposures relating primarily to a e 
in establishing the reserves for unpaid claims  management considers facts currently known and the current state of the law and coverage litigation 
liabilities are recognized for known claims including the cost of related litigation when sufficient information has been developed to indicate the involvement of a specific insurance policy  and management can reasonably estimate its liability 
in addition  reserves are established to cover loss development related to both known and unasserted claims 
the estimation of unpaid claim liabilities is subject to a high degree of uncertainty for a number of reasons 
first  unpaid claim liabilities for property and casualty exposures in general are impacted by changes in the legal environment  jury awards  medical cost trends and general inflation 
moreover  for latent exposures in particular  developed case law and adequate claim history do not exist 
there is significant coverage litigation related to these exposures  which creates further uncertainty in the estimation of the liabilities 
as a result  for these types 
table of contents of exposures  it is especially unclear whether past claim experience will be representative of future claim experience 
ultimate values for such claims cannot be estimated using reserving techniques that extrapolate losses to an ultimate basis using loss development factors  and the uncertainties surrounding the estimation of unpaid claim liabilities are not likely to be resolved in the near future 
there can be no assurance that the reserves established by us will be adequate or will not be adversely affected by the development of other latent exposures 
our asbestos claims are primarily products liability claims submitted by a variety of insureds who operated in different parts of the asbestos distribution chain 
while most such claims arise from asbestos mining and primary asbestos manufacturers  we have also been receiving claims from tertiary defendants such as smaller manufacturers  and the industry has seen an emerging trend of non products claims arising from premises exposures 
unlike products claims  primary policies generally do not contain aggregate policy limits for premises claims  which  accordingly  remain at the primary layer and  thus  rarely impact excess insurance policies 
as the vast majority of our policies are excess policies  this trend has had only a marginal effect on our asbestos exposures thus far 
asbestos reform efforts have been underway at both the federal and state level to address the cost and scope of asbestos claims to the american economy 
while congressional efforts to create a federal trust fund that would replace the tort system for asbestos claims failed  several states  including texas and florida  have passed reforms based on medical criteria requiring certain levels of medically documented injury before a lawsuit can be filed  generally resulting in a drop of case filings in those states adopting this reform measure 
asbestos claims primarily fall into two general categories impaired and unimpaired bodily injury claims 
property damage claims represent only a small fraction of asbestos claims 
impaired claims primarily include individuals suffering from mesothelioma or a cancer such as lung cancer 
unimpaired claims include asbestosis and those whose lung regions contain pleural plaques 
unlike traditional property and casualty insurers that either have large numbers of individual claims arising from personal lines such as auto  or small numbers of high value claims as in medical malpractice insurance lines  our primary exposures arise from a e claims that do not follow a consistent pattern 
for instance  we may encounter a small insured with one large environmental claim due to significant groundwater contamination  while a fortune company may submit numerous claims for relatively small values 
moreover  there is no set pattern for the life of an environmental or asbestos claim 
some of these claims may resolve within two years whereas others have remained unresolved for nearly two decades 
therefore  our open and closed claims data do not follow any identifiable or discernible pattern 
furthermore  because of the reinsurance nature of the claims we manage  we focus on the activities at the reinsured level rather than at the individual claims level 
the counterparties with whom we typically interact are generally insurers or large industrial concerns and not individual claimants 
claims do not follow any consistent pattern 
they arise from many insureds or locations and in a broad range of circumstances 
an insured may present one large claim or hundreds or thousands of small claims 
plaintiffs counsel frequently aggregate thousands of claims within one lawsuit 
the deductibles to which claims are subject vary from policy to policy and year to year 
often claims data is only available to reinsurers  such as us  on an aggregated basis 
accordingly  we have not found claim count information or average reserve amounts to be reliable indicators of exposure for our reserve estimation process or for management of our liabilities 
we have found data accumulation and claims management more effective and meaningful at the reinsured level rather than at the underlying claim level 
as a result  we have designed our reserving methodologies to be independent of claim count information 
as the level of exposures to a reinsured can vary substantially  we focus on the aggregate exposures and pursue commutations and policy buy backs with the larger reinsureds 
we employ approximately full time equivalent employees  including attorneys  actuaries  and experienced claims handlers  to directly administer our a e liabilities 
we have established a provision for future expenses of million  which reflects the total anticipated costs to administer these claims to expiration 

table of contents our future environmental loss development may be influenced by other factors including existence of currently undiscovered polluted sites eligible for clean up under the united states comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cercla and related legislation 
costs imposed due to joint and several liability if not all potentially reliable parties prps are capable of paying their share 
success of legal challenges to certain policy terms such as the absolute pollution exclusion 
potential future reforms and amendments to cercla  particularly as the resources of superfund the funding vehicle  established as part of cercla  to provide financing for cleanup of polluted sites where no prp can be identified become exhausted 
the influence of each of these factors is not easily quantifiable and  as with asbestos related exposures  our historical environmental loss development is of limited value in determining future environmental loss development using traditional actuarial reserving techniques 
there have been recent positive developments concerning lead paint liability  an area previously viewed as an emerging trend in latent claim activity with the potential to adversely affect reserves 
after a series of successful defense efforts by defendant lead pigment manufacturers in lead paint litigation  in  a rhode island trial court ruled in favor of the government in a nuisance claim against the defendant manufacturers 
since the rhode island decision  other government entities have employed the same theory for recovery against these manufacturers 
in  the rhode island supreme court reversed the sole legal liability loss experienced by lead pigment manufacturers in lead paint litigation 
the court rejected public nuisance as a viable theory of liability for use by the government against the defendants and thus invalidated the entire claim against the lead pigment manufacturers 
subsequent to the rhode island supreme court decision at least one other government entity  an ohio municipality  voluntarily dropped its lead paint suit 
thereafter  the state of ohio  voluntarily dismissed its pending action against lead pigment manufacturers 
other state supreme courts equally rejected the public nuisance theory of liability  whereas no highest state court has ever adopted this theory as an acceptable cause of action 
we believe that lead paint claims now pose a lower risk to adverse reserve adjustment than previously thought  as the only trial court decision against lead pigment manufacturers to date was reversed on the basis that public nuisance is an improper liability theory by which a plaintiff may seek recovery against the lead pigment manufacturers 
even if adverse rulings under alternative theories succeed or if other states ultimately permit recovery under a public nuisance theory  it is questionable whether insureds have coverage under their policies under which they seek indemnity 
insureds have yet to meet policy terms and conditions to establish coverage for lead paint public nuisance claims  as opposed to traditional bodily injury and property damage claims 
still  there is the potential for significant impact to excess insurers should plaintiffs prevail in successive nuisance claims pending in other jurisdictions and coverage is established 
our independent  external actuaries use industry benchmarking methodologies to estimate appropriate ibnr reserves for our a e exposures 
these methods are based on comparisons of our loss experience on a e exposures relative to industry loss experience on a e exposures 
estimates of ibnr are derived separately for each of our relevant subsidiaries and  for some subsidiaries  separately for distinct portfolios of exposure 
the discussion that follows describes  in greater detail  the primary actuarial methodologies used by our independent actuaries to estimate ibnr for a e exposures 
in addition to the specific considerations for each method described below  many general factors are considered in the application of the methods and the interpretation of results for each portfolio of exposures 
these factors include the mix of product types eg  primary insurance versus reinsurance of primary versus reinsurance of reinsurance  the average attachment point of coverages eg  first dollar primary versus umbrella over primary versus high excess  payment and reporting lags related to the international domicile of our 
table of contents subsidiaries  payment and reporting pattern acceleration due to large wholesale settlements eg  policy buy backs and commutations pursued by us  and lists of individual risks remaining and general trends within the legal and tort environments 
paid survival ratio method 
in this method  our expected annual average payment amount is multiplied by an expected future number of payment years to get an indicated reserve 
our historical calendar year payments are examined to determine an expected future annual average payment amount 
this amount is multiplied by an expected number of future payment years to estimate a reserve 
trends in calendar year payment activity are considered when selecting an expected future annual average payment amount 
accepted industry benchmarks are used in determining an expected number of future payment years 
each year  annual payments data is updated  trends in payments are re evaluated and changes to benchmark future payment years are reviewed 
this method has advantages of ease of application and simplicity of assumptions 
a potential disadvantage of the method is that results could be misleading for portfolios of high excess exposures where significant payment activity has not yet begun 
paid market share method 
in this method  our estimated market share is applied to the industry estimated unpaid losses 
the ratio of our historical calendar year payments to industry historical calendar year payments is examined to estimate our market share 
this ratio is then applied to the estimate of industry unpaid losses 
each year  calendar year payment data is updated for both us and industry  estimates of industry unpaid losses are reviewed and the selection of our estimated market share is revisited 
this method has the advantage that trends in calendar year market share can be incorporated into the selection of company share of remaining market payments 
a potential disadvantage of this method is that it is particularly sensitive to assumptions regarding the time lag between industry payments and our payments 
reserve to paid method 
in this method  the ratio of estimated industry reserves to industry paid to date losses is multiplied by our paid to date losses to estimate our reserves 
specific considerations in the application of this method include the completeness of our paid to date loss information  the potential acceleration or deceleration in our payments relative to the industry due to our claims handling practices  and the impact of large individual settlements 
each year  paid to date loss information is updated for both us and the industry and updates to industry estimated reserves are reviewed 
this method has the advantage of relying purely on paid loss data and so is not influenced by subjectivity of case reserve loss estimates 
a potential disadvantage is that the application to our portfolios which do not have complete inception to date paid loss history could produce misleading results 
to address this potential disadvantage  a variation of the method is also considered by multiplying the ratio of estimated industry reserves to industry losses paid during a recent period of time eg  years times our paid losses during that period 
ibnr case ratio method 
in this method  the ratio of estimated industry ibnr reserves to industry case reserves is multiplied by our case reserves to estimate our ibnr reserves 
specific considerations in the application of this method include the presence of policies reserved at policy limits  changes in overall industry case reserve adequacy and recent loss reporting history for us 
each year  our case reserves are updated  industry reserves are updated and the applicability of the industry ibnr case ratio is reviewed 
this method has the advantage that it incorporates the most recent estimates of amounts needed to settle open cases included in current case reserves 
a potential disadvantage is that results could be misleading where our case reserve adequacy differs significantly from overall industry case reserve adequacy 
ultimate to incurred method 
in this method  the ratio of estimated industry ultimate losses to industry incurred to date losses is applied to our incurred to date losses to estimate our ibnr reserves 
specific considerations in the application of this method include the completeness of our incurred to date loss information  the potential acceleration or deceleration in our incurred losses relative to the industry due to our claims handling practices and the impact of large individual settlements 
each year incurred to date loss information is updated for both us and the industry and updates to industry estimated ultimate losses are reviewed 
this method has the advantage that it incorporates both paid and case reserve information in projecting 
table of contents ultimate losses 
a potential disadvantage is that results could be misleading where cumulative paid loss data is incomplete or where our case reserve adequacy differs significantly from overall industry case reserve adequacy 
under the paid survival ratio method  the paid market share method and the reserve to paid method  we first determine the estimated total reserve and then deduct the reported outstanding case reserves to arrive at an estimated ibnr reserve 
the ibnr case ratio method first determines an estimated ibnr reserve which is then added to the advised outstanding case reserves to arrive at an estimated total loss reserve 
the ultimate to incurred method first determines an estimate of the ultimate losses to be paid and then deducts paid to date losses to arrive at an estimated total loss reserve and then deducts outstanding case reserves to arrive at the estimated ibnr reserve 
as of december   we had separate insurance and or reinsurance subsidiaries whose reserves are categorized into approximately reserve categories in total  including distinct asbestos reserving categories and distinct environmental reserving categories 
to the extent that data availability allows  the five methodologies described above are applied for each of the asbestos reserving categories and each of the environmental reserving categories 
as is common in actuarial practice  no one methodology is exclusively or consistently relied upon when selecting a recorded reserve 
consistent reliance on a single methodology to select a recorded reserve would be inappropriate in light of the dynamic nature of both the a e liabilities in general  and our actual exposure portfolios in particular 
in selecting a recorded reserve  management considers the range of results produced by the methods  and the strengths and weaknesses of the methods in relation to the data available and the specific characteristics of the portfolio under consideration 
trends in both our data and industry data are also considered in the reserve selection process 
recent trends or changes in the relevant tort and legal environments are also considered when assessing methodology results and selecting an appropriate recorded reserve amount for each portfolio 
the following key assumptions were used to estimate a e reserves at december  billion ultimate industry asbestos losses this level of industry wide losses and its comparison to industry wide paid  incurred and outstanding case reserves is the base benchmarking assumption applied to paid market share  reserve to paid  ibnr case ratio and the ultimate to incurred asbestos reserving methodologies 
billion ultimate industry environmental losses this level of industry wide losses and its comparison to industry wide paid  incurred and outstanding case reserves is the base benchmarking assumption applied to paid market share  reserve to paid  ibnr case ratio and the ultimate to incurred environmental reserving methodologies 
loss reporting lag our subsidiaries assumed a mix of insurance and reinsurance exposures generally through the london market 
as the available industry benchmark loss information  as supplied by our independent consulting actuaries  is compiled largely from us direct insurance company experience  our loss reporting is expected to lag relative to available industry benchmark information 
this time lag used by each of our insurance subsidiaries varies from to years depending on the relative mix of domicile  percentages of product mix of insurance  reinsurance and retrocessional reinsurance  primary insurance  excess insurance  reinsurance of direct  and reinsurance of reinsurance within any given exposure category 
exposure portfolios written from a non us domicile are assumed to have a greater time lag than portfolios written from a us domicile 
portfolios with a larger proportion of reinsurance exposures are assumed to have a greater time lag than portfolios with a larger proportion of insurance exposures 
the assumption above as to ultimate industry asbestos losses has not changed from the immediately preceding period 
as described more fully below  the assumption as to ultimate industry environmental losses has been increased from the immediately preceding period 
for our company as a whole  the average selected lag 
table of contents for asbestos has decreased slightly from years to years and the average selected lag for environmental has decreased slightly from years to years 
the changes to the selected lags arose largely as a result of the changes in the relative size of the various underlying asbestos and environmental portfolios during the following tables provide a summary of the sensitivity of reserve levels to changes in the selected value for the above referenced assumptions regarding industry ultimate losses and loss reporting lag 
please note that the table below demonstrates sensitivity to changes to key assumptions using methodologies selected for determining loss and allocated loss adjustment expenses  or alae  at december  and differs from the table on page  which demonstrates the range of outcomes produced by the various methodologies

industry publications have  since  indicated that the range of ultimate industry losses is estimated to be between approximately billion and billion for asbestos losses 
one commonly referenced benchmark estimates ultimate industry asbestos losses to be between billion and billion 
one of the reasons cited for this higher estimate is a shift of losses away from products liability claims to non products claims 
in considering the impact of this issue  it is important to understand how asbestos claims attach to policies issued by the insurance industry in general and the policies issued by the companies owned by us in particular 
historically  asbestos claims have been presented as products liability claims brought against manufacturers and distributors of asbestos containing products 
for a given manufacturer  distributor  or other entity involved in asbestos litigation  multiple claims are filed by numerous individuals 
there is typically an allocation of the settlement costs for asbestos claims over time based on exposure to asbestos by the injured claimants 
many asbestos claims will aggregate within each individual policy period to exhaust the annual aggregate policy limits which exist within policies sold to cover products liability claims 
beginning in the mid s  a trend began to emerge whereby certain policyholders began to assert that their asbestos claims should not fall within the products liability section of their policies and  therefore  should not be subject to the aggregate limits of products liability claims 
instead  the policyholder would assert that each individual bodily injury claim should be treated as a separate occurrence under the premises operations section of their policies 
under such presentation  individual claim or occurrence limits apply separately to each claim and there is no aggregate limit for the amount of premises or non products claims within a particular policy 

table of contents our exposure to asbestos losses arises largely from direct excess policies and assumed reinsurance policies written through the london market 
with respect to direct excess policies  our companies typically participated on policies whereby liability would only attach in excess of primary and umbrella policy limits 
as non products asbestos losses are not aggregated and are generally confined to the limits of the primary and other lower layer insurance policies  we believe we have very little exposure to non products asbestos losses through direct insurance policies issued by our owned subsidiary companies 
to date  we have seen no material reporting of non products asbestos claims on direct insurance policies 
the trend of asbestos losses shifting from products to non products is not a new phenomenon 
as our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries have not received any material reporting of non products claims to date and their direct insurance exposures are generally in excess of the layers of insurance impacted by non products asbestos losses  we do not expect any material future liability in respect of non products asbestos claims 
losses with respect to assumed reinsurance exposures to non products asbestos claims are unlikely to be aggregated and are generally confined to the limits of the primary and other lower layer insurance policies 
there is limited ability for such claims to exceed retained levels 
our assumed reinsurance portfolio with respect to asbestos exposures is largely excess of loss in nature and  therefore  not especially subject to non products asbestos liabilities 
to date  we have seen no material reporting of non products asbestos claims on assumed reinsurance policies 
as stated above  the trend of asbestos losses shifting from products to non products is not a new phenomenon 
as our assumed reinsurance entities have not received any material reporting of non products claims to date and their assumed reinsurance exposures generally cover layers of insurance not impacted by non products asbestos losses  management does not expect any material future liability in respect of non products asbestos claims 
other reasons cited for the higher estimate of industry ultimate asbestos losses include the ongoing uncertainty surrounding insurance coverage of asbestos claims and the ongoing reporting of significant numbers and values of malignant mesothelioma claims 
as we do not view these issues as new information  any impact has already been factored into our actuarial reserving methodologies with no need for any change in assumptions 
furthermore  in recent years  the overall asbestos loss development trend within our portfolio has been favorable 
our asbestos exposures are reviewed by independent actuaries on an annual basis as part of the overall annual loss reserve review 
actual loss reporting for asbestos claims in recent years has been below actuarial estimated expectations 
having considered the higher benchmark estimate of ultimate net asbestos losses in the context of our portfolio of loss exposures and actual asbestos loss reporting in recent years for us in particular  as well as for the insurance industry generally  we believe there is no need to increase the billion asbestos ultimate industry loss assumption 
guidance from industry publications is more varied in respect of estimates of ultimate industry environmental losses 
consistent with an industry published estimate  we believe the reasonable range for ultimate industry environmental losses is between billion and billion 
for a number of years  we have  based on advice supplied by our independent consulting actuaries  selected the midpoint of this range  billion  as the basis for our environmental loss reserving 
based on the most recent information available  industry reported incurred losses have now exceeded billion 
in addition  a notable industry publication has recently published a revised estimate of ultimate industry environmental losses of billion 
in light of these facts  we have increased our estimate of ultimate industry losses from billion to billion as the basis for our environmental loss reserving 
this change of assumption had no material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we continue to experience only moderate incurred loss development on our own portfolios of environmental exposures  and are comfortable with our carried reserve level for environmental exposures based on the analysis conducted by both our internal and our external independent actuaries 

table of contents our current estimate of the time lag that relates to our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries compared to the industry is considered reasonable given the analysis performed by our internal and external actuaries to date 
over time  additional information regarding such exposure characteristics may be developed for any given portfolio 
this additional information could cause a shift in the lag assumed 
all other non latent reserves for our all other non latent loss exposure  a range of traditional loss development extrapolation techniques is applied by our independent actuaries and us 
these methods assume that cohorts  or groups  of losses from similar exposures will increase over time in a predictable manner 
historical paid  incurred  and outstanding loss development experience is examined for earlier years to make inferences about how later years losses will develop 
the application and consideration of multiple methods is consistent with the actuarial standards of practice 
when determining which loss development extrapolation methods to apply to each company and each class of exposure within each company  we and our independent actuaries consider the nature of the exposure for each specific subsidiary and reserving segment and the available loss development data  as well as the limitations of that data 
in cases where company specific loss development information is not available or reliable  we and our independent actuaries select methods that do not rely on historical data such as incremental or run off methods and consider industry loss development information published by industry sources such as the reinsurance association of america 
in determining which methods to apply  we and our independent actuaries also consider cause of loss coding information when available 
a brief summary of the methods that are considered most frequently in analyzing non latent exposures is provided below 
this summary discusses the strengths and weaknesses of each method  as well as the data requirements for each method  all of which are considered when selecting which methods to apply for each reserve segment 
cumulative reported and paid loss development methods 
the cumulative reported case incurred loss development method relies on the assumption that  at any given state of maturity  ultimate losses can be predicted by multiplying cumulative reported losses paid losses plus case reserves by a cumulative development factor 
the validity of the results of this method depends on the stability of claim reporting and settlement rates  as well as the consistency of case reserve levels 
case reserves do not have to be adequately stated for this method to be effective  they only need to have a fairly consistent level of adequacy at all stages of maturity 
historical age to age loss development factors  or ldf s  are calculated to measure the relative development of an accident year from one maturity point to the next 
age to age ldfs are then selected based on these historical factors 
the selected age to age ldfs are used to project the ultimate losses 
the cumulative paid loss development method is mechanically identical to the cumulative reported loss development method described above  but the paid method does not rely on case reserves or claim reporting patterns in making projections 
the validity of the results from using a cumulative loss development approach can be affected by many conditions  such as internal claim department processing changes  a shift between single and multiple payments per claim  legal changes  or variations in a company s mix of business from year to year 
typically  the most appropriate circumstances in which to apply a cumulative loss development method are those in which the exposure is mature  full loss development data is available  and the historical observed loss development is relatively stable 
incremental reported and paid loss development methods 
incremental incurred and paid analyses are performed in cases where cumulative data is not available 
the concept of the incremental loss development methods is similar to the cumulative loss development methods described above  in that the pattern of historical paid or incurred losses is used to project the remaining future development 
the difference between the cumulative and incremental methods is that the incremental methods rely on only incremental incurred or paid loss data from a given point in time forward  and do not require full loss history 
these incremental loss 
table of contents development methods are therefore helpful when data limitations apply 
while this versatility in the incremental methods is a strength  the methods are sensitive to fluctuations in loss development  so care must be taken in applying them 
ibnr to case outstanding method 
this method requires the estimation of consistent cumulative paid and reported case incurred loss development patterns and age to ultimate ldfs  either from data that is specific to the segment being analyzed or from applicable benchmark or industry data 
these patterns imply a specific expected relationship between ibnr  including both development on known claims bulk reserve and losses on true late reported claims  and reported case incurred losses 
the ibnr to case outstanding method can be used in a variety of situations 
it is appropriate for loss development experience that is mature and possesses a very high ratio of paid losses to reported case incurred losses 
the method also permits an evaluation of the difference in maturity between the business being reviewed and benchmark development patterns 
depending on the relationship of paid to incurred losses  an estimate of the relative maturity of the business being reviewed can be made and a subsequent estimate of ultimate losses driven by the implied ibnr to case outstanding ratio at the appropriate maturity can be made 
this method is also useful where loss development data is incomplete and only the case outstanding amounts are determined to be reliable 
this method is less reliable in situations where relative case reserve adequacy has been changing over time 
bornhuetter ferguson expected loss projection reported and paid methods 
the bornhuetter ferguson expected loss projection method based on reported loss data relies on the assumption that remaining unreported losses are a function of the total expected losses rather than a function of currently reported losses 
the expected losses used in this analysis are based on initial selected ultimate loss ratios by year 
the expected losses are multiplied by the unreported percentage to produce expected unreported losses 
the unreported percentage is calculated as one minus the reciprocal of the selected cumulative incurred ldfs 
finally  the expected unreported losses are added to the current reported losses to produce ultimate losses 
the calculations underlying the bornhuetter ferguson expected loss projection method based on paid loss data are similar to the bornhuetter ferguson calculations based on reported losses  with the exception that paid losses and unpaid percentages replace reported losses and unreported percentages 
the bornhuetter ferguson method is most useful as an alternative to other models for immature years 
for these immature years  the amounts reported or paid may be small and unstable and therefore not predictive of future development 
therefore  future development is assumed to follow an expected pattern that is supported by more stable historical data or by emerging trends 
this method is also useful when changing reporting patterns or payment patterns distort historical development of losses 
similar to the loss development methods  the bornhuetter ferguson method may be applied to loss and alae on a combined or separate basis 
the bornhuetter ferguson method may not be appropriate in circumstances where the liabilities being analyzed are very mature  as it is not sensitive to the remaining amount of case reserves outstanding  or the actual development to date 
reserve run off method 
this method first projects the future values of case reserves for all underwriting years to future ages of development 
this is done by selecting a run off pattern of case reserves 
the selected case run off ratios are chosen based on the observed run off ratios at each age of development 
once the ratios have been selected  they are used to project the future values of case reserves 
a paid on reserve factor is selected in a similar way 
the ratios of the observed amounts paid during each development period to the respective case reserves at the beginning of the periods are used to estimate how much will be paid on the case reserves during each development period 
these paid on reserve factors are then applied to the case reserve amounts that were projected during the first phase of this method 
a summation of the resulting paid amounts yields an estimate of the liability 
the reserve run off method works well when the historical run off patterns are reasonably stable and when case reserves ultimately show a decreasing trend 
another strength of this method is that it only requires case reserves at a given point in time and incremental paid and incurred losses after that point  meaning that it can be applied in cases where full loss history is not available 
in cases of volatile data where there is a persistent increasing trend in case reserves  this method will fail to produce a reasonable estimate 
in several cases  reliance upon this method was limited due to this weakness 

table of contents our independent actuaries select the appropriate loss development extrapolation methods to apply to each company and each class of exposure  and then apply these methods to calculate an estimate of ultimate losses 
our management  which is responsible for the final estimate of ultimate losses  reviews the calculations of our independent actuaries  considers whether the appropriate method was applied  and adjusts the estimate of ultimate losses as it deems necessary 
historically  we have not deviated from the recommendations of our independent actuaries 
paid to date losses are then deducted from the estimate of ultimate losses to arrive at an estimated total loss reserve  and reported outstanding case reserves are then deducted from estimated total loss reserves to calculate the estimated ibnr reserve 
net reduction in ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense liabilities the change in our estimated total loss reserves for both latent and all other exposures compared to that of the previous period  less net losses paid during the period  is recorded as a reduction in net ultimate losses on our statement of earnings for the period 
our estimated total loss reserve at december  was determined by estimating the ultimate losses and deducting paid to date losses 
the estimated ultimate losses  for both latent and all other non latent liabilities  were determined by the amount of advised case reserves and the application of the actuarial methodologies described above to estimate ibnr reserves 
future changes in our estimates of ultimate losses are likely to have a significant impact on future operating results 
our operating objective is to commute our loss exposures and manage non commuted loss development in a disciplined manner such that future incurred loss development will be less than expected 
a combination of future commutations and better than expected incurred loss development of non commuted exposures could improve the trend of loss development and  after the application of actuarial methodologies to the improved trend  reduce the december  estimates of ultimate losses with a positive impact on our future results 
however  it is not possible to project future commutation settlements or whether incurred loss development will be better than expected  and it is possible that ultimate loss reserves could increase based on the factors discussed herein 
quarterly reserve reviews in addition to an in depth annual review  we also perform quarterly reserve reviews 
this is done by examining quarterly paid and incurred loss development to determine whether it is consistent with reserves established during the preceding annual reserve review and with expected development 
loss development is reviewed separately for each major exposure type eg  asbestos  environmental  etc  for each of our relevant subsidiaries  and for large wholesale commutation settlements versus routine paid and advised losses 
this process is undertaken to determine whether loss development experience during a quarter warrants any change to held reserves 
loss development is examined separately by exposure type because different exposures develop differently over time 
for example  the expected reporting and payout of losses for a given amount of asbestos reserves can be expected to take place over a different time frame and in a different quarterly pattern from the same amount of environmental reserves 
in addition  loss development is examined separately for each of our relevant subsidiaries 
companies can differ in their exposure profile due to the mix of insurance versus reinsurance  the mix of primary versus excess insurance  the underwriting years of participation and other criteria 
these differing profiles lead to different expectations for quarterly and annual loss development by company 
our quarterly paid and incurred loss development is often driven by large  wholesale settlements such as commutations and policy buy backs which settle many individual claims in a single transaction 
this allows for monitoring of the potential profitability of large settlements which  in turn  can provide information about the adequacy of reserves on remaining exposures which have not yet been settled 
for example  if it were found that large settlements were consistently leading to large negative  or favorable  incurred losses upon settlement  it might be an indication that reserves on remaining exposures are redundant 
conversely  if it were found that large settlements were consistently leading to large positive  or adverse  incurred losses upon 
table of contents settlement  it might be an indication particularly if the size of the losses were increasing that certain loss reserves on remaining exposures are deficient 
moreover  removing the loss development resulting from large settlements allows for a review of loss development related only to those contracts which remain exposed to losses 
were this not done  it is possible that savings on large wholesale settlements could mask significant underlying development on remaining exposures 
once the data has been analyzed as described above  an in depth review is performed on classes of exposure with significant loss development 
discussions are held with appropriate personnel  including individual company managers  claims handlers and attorneys  to better understand the causes 
if it were determined that development differs significantly from expectations  reserves would be adjusted 
quarterly loss development is expected to be fairly erratic for the types of exposure insured and reinsured by us 
several quarters of low incurred loss development can be followed by spikes of relatively large incurred losses 
this is characteristic of latent claims and other insurance losses which are reported and settled many years after the inception of the policy 
given the high degree of statistical uncertainty  and potential volatility  it would be unusual to adjust reserves on the basis of one  or even several  quarters of loss development activity 
as a result  unless the incurred loss activity in any one quarter is of such significance that management is able to quantify the impact on the ultimate liability for loss and loss adjustment expenses  reductions or increases in loss and loss adjustment expense liabilities are carried out in the fourth quarter based on the annual reserve review described above 
as described above  our management regularly reviews and updates reserve estimates using the most current information available and employing various actuarial methods 
adjustments resulting from changes in our estimates are recorded in the period when such adjustments are determined 
the ultimate liability for loss and loss adjustment expenses is likely to differ from the original estimate due to a number of factors  primarily consisting of the overall claims activity occurring during any period  including the completion of commutations of assumed liabilities and ceded reinsurance receivables  policy buy backs and general incurred claims activity 
reinsurance balances receivable our acquired insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries  prior to acquisition by us  used reinsurance and retrocessional agreements to reduce their exposure to the risk of insurance and reinsurance they assumed 
loss and loss adjustment expense reserves represent total gross reserves for unpaid losses  and reinsurance receivables represent anticipated recoveries of a portion of those unpaid losses as well as amounts receivable from reinsurers with respect to claims that have already been paid 
while reinsurance arrangements are designed to limit losses and to permit recovery of a portion of direct paid losses  they do not relieve us of our liabilities to our insureds or reinsureds 
therefore  we evaluate and monitor concentration of credit risk among our reinsurers  including companies that are insolvent  in run off or facing financial difficulties in order to make provisions for amounts considered potentially uncollectible 
reinsurance balances receivable increased by million during primarily as a result of additional reinsurance receivables acquired during the year partially offset by cash collections 
at december  and  the provision for uncollectible reinsurance relating to losses recoverable was million and million  respectively 
to estimate the provision for uncollectible reinsurance recoverable  the reinsurance recoverables are first allocated to applicable reinsurers 
this determination is based on a detailed process rather than an estimate  although an element of judgment is applied  with respect to the allocation of ceded ibnr 
the stronger creditworthiness of reinsurance receivables acquired in compared to reinsurance receivables at december   combined with the reduction in aggregate provisions for bad debt of million following the collection of reinsurance receivables against which bad debt provisions had been provided in earlier periods  resulted in a lower provision for uncollectible reinsurance at december  compared to the provision at december  we use detailed analysis to estimate uncollectible reinsurance by applying the bad debt provision to reinsurance recoverable balances by reinsurer to determine the portion of a reinsurer s balance deemed to be 
table of contents uncollectible 
these provisions require considerable judgment and are determined using the current rating  or rating equivalent  of each reinsurer in order to determine its ability to settle the reinsurance balances as well as other key considerations and assumptions  such as claims and coverage issues and age of debt 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for an analysis of reinsurance recoverables 
provisions for unallocated loss adjustment expense liabilities provisions for unallocated loss adjustment expense liabilities are estimated by management by determining the future annual costs to be incurred by us  comprising staff costs  consultancy and professional fees and overheads  in managing the run off of claims liabilities for each of our insurance and reinsurance entities 
the provision is reviewed quarterly and reduced in accordance with the related costs incurred each period 
fair value measurements of investments the following is a summary of valuation techniques or models we use to measure fair value by asset classes  which have not changed significantly since december  fixed maturity investments our fixed maturity portfolio is managed by our chief investment officer and our outside investment advisors 
we use inputs from nationally recognized pricing services  including pricing vendors  index providers and broker dealers to estimate fair value measurements for all of our fixed maturity investments 
these pricing services include ft interactive data  barclays capital aggregate index  reuters pricing service and others 
in general  the pricing services use observable market inputs including  but not limited to  investment yields  credit risks and spreads  benchmark curves  benchmarking of like securities  non binding broker dealer quotes  reported trades and sector groupings to determine the fair value 
in addition  pricing services use valuation models  such as an option adjusted spread model  to develop prepayment and interest rate scenarios 
the option adjusted spread model is commonly used to estimate fair value for securities such as mortgage backed and asset backed securities 
with the exception of one security held within our trading portfolio  the fair value estimates of our fixed maturity investments are based on observable market data 
we have therefore included these as level investments within the fair value hierarchy 
the one security in our trading portfolio that does not have observable inputs has been included as a level investment within the fair value hierarchy 
to validate the techniques or models used by the pricing services  we compare the fair value estimates to our knowledge of the current market and will challenge any prices deemed not to be representative of fair value 
as of december   there were no material differences between the prices obtained from the pricing services and the fair value estimates developed by us 
in evaluating credit losses  we consider a variety of factors in the assessment of a fixed maturity investment including the time period during which there has been a significant decline below cost  the extent of the decline below cost and par  the potential for the investment to recover in value  an analysis of the financial condition of the issuer  the rating of the issuer  and failure of the issuer of the investment to make scheduled interest or principal payments 
based on the factors described above  we determined that  as of december   no credit losses existed 
equity securities our equity securities are managed by two external advisors 
through these third parties  we use nationally recognized pricing services  including pricing vendors  index providers and broker dealers to estimate fair value measurements for all of our equity securities 
these pricing services include ft interactive data and others 

table of contents we have categorized all of our investments in common stock as level investments because the fair values of these securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
we categorized our investments in preferred stock as level  with the exception of one which was categorized as level  because the fair value estimates are based on observable market data 
other investments for our investments in private equities  we measure fair value by obtaining the most recently published net asset value as advised by the external fund manager or third party administrator 
the use of net asset value as an estimate of the fair value for investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value is a permitted practical expedient 
our private equity investments are mainly in the financial services industry 
the fund advisors continue to evaluate the overall market environment  as well as specific areas in the financial services sector  in order to identify segments that they believe will offer the most attractive investment opportunities 
the financial statements of each fund generally are audited annually under us gaap  using fair value measurement for the underlying investments 
for all publicly traded companies within the funds  we have valued those investments based on the latest share price 
the value of affirmative investment llc in which we own a non voting membership interest is based on the market value of the shares of affirmative insurance holdings  inc  a publicly traded company 
all of our investments in private equities are subject to restrictions on redemptions and sales that are determined by the governing documents and limit our ability to liquidate those investments in the short term 
the capital commitments are discussed in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have classified our private equities as level investments because they reflect our own judgment about the assumptions that market participants might use 
for our investment in the hedge fund  we also measure fair value by obtaining the most recently published net asset value as advised by the external fund manager or third party administrator 
the adviser of the fund intends to seek attractive risk adjusted total returns for the fund s investors by acquiring  originating  and actively managing a diversified portfolio of debt securities  with a focus on various forms of asset backed securities and loans 
the fund will focus on investments that the adviser believes to be fundamentally undervalued with current market prices that are believed to be compelling relative to intrinsic value 
the units of account that are valued by us are our interests in the fund and not the underlying holdings of the fund 
thus  the inputs used to value our investments in the fund may differ from the inputs used to value the underlying holdings of the fund 
the hedge fund is not currently eligible for redemption due to an imposed lock up period of three years from the time of the initial investment 
once eligible  redemptions will be permitted quarterly with days notice 
there are no unfunded capital commitments in relation to the hedge fund 
the investment in the fund is classified as level in the fair value hierarchy 
the bond funds have been classified as level investments because their fair value is estimated using the net asset value reported by bloomberg and they have daily liquidity 
for the year ended december   the share of net earnings on our other investments was million as compared to million for the year ended december   any unrealized losses or gains on our other investments are included as part of our net investment income 

table of contents the following table summarizes all of our financial assets recorded at fair value at december   by the hierarchy established by the fair value measurement and disclosure topic of fasb asc december  quoted prices in active markets for identical assets level significant other observable inputs level significant unobservable inputs level total fair value in thousands of us dollars us government and agency non us government corporate municipal residential mortgage backed commercial mortgage backed asset backed equities other investments total investments as a percentage of total assets goodwill the intangibles goodwill and other topic of fasb asc requires that recorded goodwill be assessed for impairment on at least an annual basis 
asc requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date  measured at their fair values as of that date 
asc also requires the acquirer to recognize acquisition related costs separately from the acquisition  recognize assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contractual contingencies at their acquisition date fair values and recognize goodwill as the excess of the consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired 
in determining goodwill  we must determine the fair value of the assets of an acquired company 
the determination of fair value necessarily involves many assumptions 
fair values of reinsurance assets and liabilities acquired are derived from probability weighted ranges of the associated projected cash flows  based on actuarially prepared information and our management s run off strategy 
fair value adjustments are based on the estimated timing of loss and loss adjustment expense payments and an assumed interest rate  and are amortized over the estimated payout period  as adjusted for accelerations on commutation settlements  using the constant yield method option 
interest rates used to determine the fair value of gross loss reserves are based upon risk free rates applicable to the average duration of the loss reserves 
interest rates used to determine the fair value of reinsurance receivables are increased to reflect the credit risk associated with the reinsurers from which the receivables are  or will become  due 
if the assumptions made in initially valuing the assets change significantly in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth our selected consolidated statements of earnings data for each of the periods indicated years ended december  in thousands of us dollars income consulting fees net investment income net realized and unrealized gains gain on bargain purchase expenses net reduction in ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense liabilities reduction in estimates of net ultimate losses reduction in provisions for bad debt reduction in provisions for unallocated loss adjustment expense liabilities amortization of fair value adjustments salaries and benefits general and administrative expenses interest expense net foreign exchange losses gains earnings before income taxes and share of net earnings of partly owned company income taxes share of net earnings of partly owned company net earnings less net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest net earnings attributable to enstar group limited comparison of years ended december  and we reported consolidated net earnings  before net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest  of approximately million and approximately million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in earnings of approximately million was attributable primarily to the following i a decrease in net investment income of million primarily as a result of a decrease  in  in the fair value of our private equity portfolio classified as other investments of million compared to a gain of million in  along with a decrease in net investment income due primarily to lower yields earned on our fixed maturity investments driven by lower interest rates in developed economies  primarily the united states 
ii a lower net reduction in ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense liabilities of million  iii an increase in general and administrative expenses of million due primarily to an increase in loan structure fees and letter of credit fees that were paid in along with an overall increase in other professional fees  
table of contents iv a decrease of million in income earned from our investment in partly owned company as a result of its disposal in  v a decrease in consulting fee income of million due primarily to a decrease in fees earned in relation to incentive based fee arrangements  vi a decrease in net realized and unrealized gains of million due primarily to mark to market changes in the market value of our equity securities  and vii an increase in salaries and benefits costs of million due primarily to our increased overall headcount from at december  to at december  offset by a reduction in salary costs related to our discretionary bonus plan as a result of decreased net earnings in the year  partially offset by viii a decrease in income taxes of million due to decreased tax liabilities recorded on the results of our taxable subsidiaries along with no provision in for an additional tax liability of million provided for in arising in our australian subsidiary from the formation of an australian tax consolidated group  ix a gain on bargain purchase of million in  which arose in relation to our acquisition of laguna  and x a decrease in interest expense of million due primarily to lower interest rates on the loan facilities outstanding during we recorded noncontrolling interest in earnings of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively

the decrease in consulting fees of million related primarily to the decrease in management fees earned from incentive based fee agreements 
we would expect consulting fee income to remain at or around current levels in future periods  excluding the impact of any one time incentive based fees that we might receive 
while we intend to continue to provide management and consultancy services  claims inspection services and reinsurance collection services to third party clients in limited circumstances  our core focus continues to be acquiring and managing insurance and reinsurance companies and portfolios of business in run off

table of contents net investment income for the year ended december  decreased by million to million  as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was attributable primarily to the combination of the following items i a decrease of million in the fair value of our private equity portfolio  for the year ended december   as compared to an increase of million for the same period in  and ii a decrease in investment income due to lower yields on our fixed maturity investments driven by lower interest rates in developed economies  primarily the united states 
the average return on the cash and fixed maturities investments excluding any writedowns or appreciation related to our other investments for the year ended december  was as compared to the average return of for the year ended december  the average credit rating of our fixed maturity investments at december  was aa 
during  the rating agency standard poors downgraded the us sovereign debt from aaa to aa 
this  combined with the assets we acquired upon the acquisition of clarendon  which had a lower proportion of investments with aaa credit ratings  has resulted in us having a lower percentage of aaa rated investments than we had as at december  see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the credit ratings of our investments 
net realized and unrealized gains for the year ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
the decrease was due primarily to mark to market changes in the market value of our equity securities 
fair value measurements in accordance with the provisions of the fair value measurement and disclosure topic of fasb asc  we have categorized our investments that are recorded at fair value among levels as follows december  quoted prices in active markets for identical assets level significant other observable inputs level significant unobservable inputs level total fair value in thousands of us dollars us government and agency non us government corporate municipal residential mortgage backed commercial mortgage backed asset backed equities other investments total investments

the gain on bargain purchase was earned in connection with our acquisition of laguna and represents the excess of the cumulative fair value of net assets acquired of million over the cost of million 
this excess has  in accordance with the provisions of the business combinations topic of fasb asc  been recognized as income for the year ended december  the gain on bargain purchase arose mainly as a result of our reassessment  upon acquisition  of the total required estimated costs to manage the business to expiry 
our assessment of costs was lower than the acquired costs recorded by the vendor in the financial statements of laguna 
net reduction in ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense liabilities the following table shows the components of the net reduction in ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense liabilities for the years ended december  and years ended december  in thousands of us dollars net losses paid net change in case and lae reserves net change in ibnr reduction in estimates of net ultimate losses reduction in provisions for bad debt reduction in provisions for unallocated loss adjustment expense liabilities amortization of fair value adjustments net reduction in ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense liabilities 
table of contents net reduction in case and lae reserves comprises the movement during the year in specific case reserve liabilities as a result of claims settlements or changes advised to us by our policyholders and attorneys  less changes in case reserves recoverable advised by us to our reinsurers as a result of the settlement or movement of assumed claims 
net reduction in ibnr represents the change in our actuarial estimates of losses incurred but not reported 
the net reduction in ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense liabilities for the year ended december  of million was attributable to a reduction in estimates of net ultimate losses of million  a reduction in aggregate provisions for bad debts of million and a reduction in estimates of unallocated loss adjustment expense liabilities of million  relating to run off activity  partially offset by the amortization  over the estimated payout period  of fair value adjustments relating to companies acquired amounting to million 
the reduction in estimates of net ultimate losses of million comprised net incurred favorable loss development of million and reductions in ibnr reserves of million 
the decrease in the aggregate estimate of ibnr loss reserves of million compared to million during the year ended december  was comprised of million relating to asbestos liabilities compared to million in  million relating to environmental liabilities compared to million in and million relating to all other remaining liabilities compared to million in 
the aggregate reduction in ibnr of million was a result of the application  on a basis consistent with the assumptions applied in the prior period  of our actuarial methodologies to revised historical loss development data  following commutations including three commutations completed shortly after december   to estimate loss reserves required to cover liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses relating to non commuted exposures 
the prior period estimate of aggregate net ibnr liabilities was reduced as a result of the combined impact on all classes of business of loss development activity during  including commutations and the favorable trend of loss development related to non commuted policies compared to prior forecasts 
the net incurred favorable loss development of million  resulting from settlement of net advised case and lae reserves of million for net paid losses of million  related to the settlement of non commuted losses in the year and approximately commutations of assumed and ceded exposures  excluding the three commutations completed subsequent to december  net incurred liabilities settled by way of commutation during the year ended december  excluding the three commutations completed subsequent to december  amounted to million compared to the net reduction in advised case reserves during the same period of million 
commutations provide an opportunity for us to exit exposures to entire policies with insureds and reinsureds at a discount to the previous estimated ultimate liability 
as a result of exiting all exposures to such policies  all advised case reserves and ibnr liabilities relating to that insured or reinsured are eliminated 
this often results in a net gain irrespective of whether the settlement exceeds the advised case reserves 
we adopt a disciplined approach to the review and settlement of non commuted claims through claims adjusting and the inspection of underlying policyholder records such that settlements of assumed exposures may often be achieved below the level of the originally advised loss  and settlements of ceded receivables may often be achieved at levels above carried balances 
of the commutations completed  nine related to our top ten insured and or reinsured exposures  including three completed shortly after december  whereby the related reduction in ibnr reserves was recorded in the reduction in net ultimate losses for the year  and two related to our top ten ceded reinsurance assets 
the remaining commutations  of which approximately were completed during the three months ended december   were of a smaller size  consistent with our approach of targeting significant numbers of cedant and reinsurer relationships  as well as targeting significant individual cedant and reinsurer relationships 
the combination of the claims settlement activity in  including commutations  and the actuarial estimation of ibnr reserves required for the remaining non commuted exposures which took into account the favorable trend of loss development in related to such exposures compared to prior forecasts  resulted in our management concluding that the loss development activity that occurred subsequent to the prior reporting period provided sufficient new information to warrant a reduction in ibnr reserves of million in

table of contents general and administrative expenses years ended december  variance in thousands of us dollars total general and administrative expenses increased by million during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the increased expenses in related primarily to i increased bank costs of million primarily associated with the costs of establishing and maintaining our letters of credit  along with the arrangement and agency fees paid in relation to the establishment of both our clarendon facility and egl revolving credit facility  ii additional general and administrative expenses of million incurred in relation to both new acquisitions and significant new business that we completed in  iii increased legal expenses of approximately million due primarily to legal fees and settlement costs associated with certain litigation  along with legal fees associated with due diligence projects  and iv an increase in actuarial consulting fees of approximately million due to costs associated with due diligence projects  partially offset by v a reduction in general and administrative expense of million related to recovery of million on a previously written off asset  release of million related to provisions on certain other assets  and savings of million associated with settlement of other liabilities below their carried amount 
interest expense years ended december  variance in thousands of us dollars total interest expense of million and million was recorded for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense was attributable primarily to the lower interest rates on the loan facilities outstanding during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in income tax expense years ended december  variance in thousands of us dollars total we recorded income tax expense of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in taxes was due primarily to the combination of i lower overall net earnings in our tax paying subsidiaries for the year ended december  as compared to those earned for the year ended december   and ii during  in order to mitigate the tax impacts of inter group transactions  the boards of our australian group of companies elected to form a consolidated tax group 
the impact of this tax consolidation resulted in resetting the cost base of certain assets  which resulted in us recording a tax charge in of approximately million 

table of contents share of net earnings of partly owned company years ended december  variance in thousands of us dollars total for the year ended december   we recorded nil as our share of net earnings of partly owned company as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was attributable to the fact that we no longer have an investment in a partly owned company  during  we disposed of our indirect interest in stonewall insurance company and we acquired a interest in seaton insurance company 
noncontrolling interest years ended december  variance in thousands of us dollars total we recorded a noncontrolling interest in earnings of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in noncontrolling interest for the year ended december  was due primarily to the increase in earnings for those companies where there exists a noncontrolling interest 
comparison of years ended december  and due to the growing insignificance of our consulting activities in relation to our core reinsurance operations  in we reevaluated our segment reporting and concluded that we have one reportable segment 
as a result of the decreasing relative significance of consulting services and the associated revenues and earnings  we no longer monitor the results of consulting activities separately for evaluating business performance and for making resource allocation decisions 
accordingly  effective january   we no longer report separately the results of our consulting activities 
prior to  however  we reported two segments  reinsurance and consulting  and the following comparison of the and results of operations presents our earnings data on the basis of those two segments 
each line item marked total below can be compared to the corresponding line item entry marked total in the comparison of the and results of operations 
we reported consolidated net earnings  before net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest  of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in earnings of approximately million was primarily attributable to the following i an increase in net investment income of million primarily as a result of an increase  in  in the fair value of our private equity portfolio classified as other investments of million along with an increase in net investment income due to an increase in cash and investment balances held during  ii an increase in net realized and unrealized gains of million due primarily to mark to market changes in the market value of our equity investments along with realized gains on the sale of our fixed maturity securities  iii a larger net reduction in ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense liabilities of million  iv an increase in consulting fee income of million  v reduced interest expense of million due primarily to an overall reduction in loan facility balances outstanding during  
table of contents vi an increase of million in income earned from our investment in partly owned company  and vii a decrease in net foreign exchange losses of million due primarily to eliminating our excess us dollar exposure that we held in within one of our subsidiaries whose functional currency is australian dollars  partially offset by viii an increase in general and administrative expenses of million due primarily to an increase in loan structure fees and letter of credit fees that were paid in along with an overall increase in other professional fees  ix an increase in income taxes of million due to increased tax liabilities recorded on the results of our taxable subsidiaries along with an additional tax liability arising in our australian subsidiaries from the formation of an australian tax consolidated group  and x an increase in salaries and benefits costs of million due primarily to our increased overall headcount from at december  to at december  along with increased salary costs related to our discretionary bonus plan as a result of increased net earnings in the year

the increase in consulting fees related primarily to the combination of additional fees received from our reinsurance segment and increased incentive fees earned from third party agreements 
internal management fees of million and million were paid for the years ended december  and  respectively  by our reinsurance companies to our consulting companies 
the increase in internal fees paid to the consulting segment was due primarily to additional fees paid by reinsurance companies relating to allocated charges for increases in salary and general and administrative expenses

table of contents net investment income for the year ended december  increased by million to million  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was attributable primarily to the combination of the following items i an increase of million  for the year ended december   in the fair value of our private equity investments classified as other investments over that recorded for the year ended december   and ii higher investment income from our fixed maturities and cash and cash equivalents  reflecting the increase in the amount of cash and investment balances held by us in as compared to the increased cash and investments arose primarily as a result of the completion of the purchase of six companies along with the acquisition of eight portfolios of business in run off during the year ended december  the average return on the cash and fixed maturities investments excluding any writedowns or appreciation related to our other investments for the year ended december  was as compared to the average return of for the year ended december  the average credit rating of our fixed maturity investments at december  was aa 
net realized and unrealized gains for the year ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
the increase was due primarily to mark to market gains earned on our equity securities 
fair value measurements in accordance with the provisions of the fair value measurement and disclosure topic of fasb asc  we have categorized our investments that are recorded at fair value among levels as follows december  quoted prices in active markets for identical assets level significant other observable inputs level significant unobservable inputs level total fair value in thousands of us dollars us government and agency non us government corporate municipal residential mortgage backed commercial mortgage backed asset backed equities other investments total investments

the reduction in estimates of net ultimate losses of million comprised net incurred favorable loss development of million and reductions in ibnr reserves of million 
the decrease in the aggregate estimate of ibnr loss reserves of million compared to million during the year ended december  was comprised of million relating to asbestos liabilities compared to million in  million relating to environmental liabilities compared to million in and million relating to all other remaining liabilities compared to million in 
the aggregate reduction in ibnr of million was a result of the application  on a basis consistent with the assumptions applied in the prior period  of our actuarial methodologies to revised historical loss development data following commutations to estimate loss reserves required to cover liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses relating to non commuted exposures 
the prior period estimate of aggregate net ibnr liabilities was reduced as a result of the combined impact on all classes of business of loss development activity during  including commutations and the favorable trend of loss development related to non commuted policies compared 
table of contents to prior forecasts 
the lower reduction in asbestos ibnr reserves during was primarily due to reduced commutations of asbestos related exposures compared to the prior year 
total net loss reserves acquired from january  to december  amounted to  million  of which  million  or related to all other losses 
this increase in all other loss reserves provided the basis for a greater reduction in all other ibnr reserves 
the net incurred favorable loss development of million  resulting from settlement of net advised case and lae reserves of million for net paid losses of million  related to the settlement of non commuted losses in the year and approximately commutations of assumed and ceded exposures 
net incurred liabilities settled by way of commutation during the year ended december  amounted to million compared to the net reduction in advised case reserves during the same period of million 
of the commutations completed during  three related to our top ten insured and or reinsured exposures  including one commutation completed shortly after december  whereby the related reduction in ibnr reserves was recorded in the reduction in net ultimate losses for the year ended december   and one related to the commutation of one of our largest ceded reinsurance assets 
the remaining commutations  of which approximately were completed during the three months ended december   were of a smaller size  consistent with our approach of targeting significant numbers of cedant and reinsurer relationships  as well as targeting significant individual cedant and reinsurer relationships 
the combination of the claims settlement activity in  including commutations but excluding the impact of the commutation that was completed subsequent to the year ended december  and the actuarial estimation of ibnr reserves required for the remaining non commuted exposures which took into account the favorable trend of loss development in related to such exposures compared to prior forecasts  resulted in our management concluding that the loss development activity that occurred subsequent to the prior reporting period provided sufficient new information to warrant a reduction in ibnr reserves of million in the reduction in aggregate provisions for bad debt of million was a result of the collection  primarily during the three months ended december   of certain reinsurance receivables against which bad debt provisions had been provided in earlier periods

table of contents salaries and benefits years ended december  variance in thousands of us dollars consulting reinsurance total salaries and benefits  which include expenses relating to our discretionary bonus and employee share plans  were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to i an increase in the discretionary bonus expense for the year ended december  of million 
expenses relating to our discretionary bonus plan will be variable and are dependent on our overall profitability  ii increased staff costs due to an increase in average staff numbers from at december  to at december   iii a payment of million to our former executive chairman  john j 
oros  in accordance with the terms of his separation agreement  and iv amortization of unrecognized compensation costs of million relating to the restricted shares that were awarded to certain employees in under the equity incentive plan 
general and administrative expenses years ended december  variance in thousands of us dollars consulting reinsurance total general and administrative expenses attributable to the consulting segment increased by million during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the increased expenses in related primarily to i increased loan structure fees incurred primarily related to the enstar group facility  ii increased legal fees relating to ongoing litigation costs  and iii increased audit and actuarial tax fees due primarily to growth of the group and increased tax fees relating to the work done in connection with our australian tax consolidation 
general and administrative expenses attributable to the reinsurance segment increased by million during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the increased expenses in related primarily to increased costs associated with new companies of approximately million and additional letters of credit costs associated with portfolios of run off business acquired during 
table of contents interest expense years ended december  variance in thousands of us dollars consulting reinsurance total interest expense of million and million was recorded for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense was attributable primarily to the reduction and then elimination of the principal balance of the term facility of our wholly owned subsidiary  cumberland holdings limited  partially offset by interest expense incurred on both the knapton facility and the loan associated with the repurchase agreements 
net foreign exchange gains losses years ended december  variance in thousands of us dollars consulting reinsurance total we recorded a foreign exchange gain of million for the year ended december   as compared to a foreign exchange loss of million for the year ended december  in october  we entered into a foreign currency forward exchange contract as part of our overall foreign currency risk management strategy 
on the value date  june   we sold au million and received million 
the contract exchange rate was au for 
as at december   the fair value of the contract was million  the effect of which we recognized as a foreign exchange loss included as part of our net earnings 
this loss was offset by foreign exchange gains of approximately million arising primarily from our holdings of surplus british pounds and australian dollars at a time when these currencies were appreciating against the us dollar 
for the year ended december   million including noncontrolling interest s share of million of the foreign exchange loss arose primarily as a result of holding surplus us dollar denominated assets by gordian  our australian subsidiary  at a time when the us dollar had weakened significantly against the australian dollar 
excluding the foreign exchange loss in gordian of million  exchange gains of million were generated during the year ended december  primarily as a result of our holding surplus british pounds relating to cash collateral required to support british pound denominated letters of credit required by uk regulators at a time when the british pound exchange rate to the us dollar had increased from approximately as at january  to as at december  since letters of credit were in excess of the british pound liabilities held by our subsidiaries  the subsidiary companies were unable to match the surplus assets against liabilities during the year  resulting in the foreign exchange gain 
in addition to the foreign exchange gain we recorded in our consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended december   we recorded in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income foreign currency translation adjustment gains for the year ended december  of approximately million  as compared 
table of contents to gains of approximately million for the year ended december  we have concluded that under the foreign currency matters topic of the fasb asc the functional currency of gordian is australian dollars 
as a result  upon conversion of the net australian dollar assets of gordian to us dollars  we recorded million  net of noncontrolling interest of million  of us dollar foreign currency translation adjustment gains through accumulated other comprehensive income 
this gain was due primarily to the appreciation in the australian to us dollar foreign exchange rate from au as at december   to au at december  as our functional currency is the us dollar  we seek to manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange by broadly matching foreign currency assets against foreign currency liabilities  subject to regulatory constraints 
the net impact on shareholders equity of foreign exchange movements relating specifically to gordian are summarized in the table below years ended december  in thousands of us dollars foreign exchange gains losses recorded through earnings net of noncontrolling interest of million and million  respectively foreign exchange losses recorded through earnings related to the forward foreign exchange contract net of noncontrolling interest of million foreign exchange gains recorded through accumulated other comprehensive income net of noncontrolling interest of million and million  respectively combined increase in shareholders equity income tax expense recovery years ended december  variance in thousands of us dollars consulting reinsurance total we recorded income tax expense of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
income tax expense of million and million were recorded in the reinsurance segment for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in tax arose due primarily to increased income from our uk subsidiaries and our australian subsidiaries  which recorded increased taxes in of million and million  respectively 
in addition  during the three months ended december   in order to mitigate the tax impacts of inter group transactions  the boards of our australian group of companies elected to form a consolidated tax group 
the impact of this tax consolidation resulted in resetting the cost base of certain assets  which resulted in an additional tax liability in of approximately million 

table of contents noncontrolling interest years ended december  variance in thousands of us dollars consulting reinsurance total we recorded a noncontrolling interest in earnings of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease for the year ended december  related to the decrease in earnings for those entities that have noncontrolling interests 
liquidity and capital resources as we are a holding company and have no substantial operations of our own  our assets consist primarily of investments in our subsidiaries 
the potential sources of cash flows to the holding company consist of dividends  advances and loans from our subsidiary companies 
our future cash flows depend upon the availability of dividends or other statutorily permissible payments from our subsidiaries 
the ability to pay dividends and make other distributions is limited by the applicable laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate  including bermuda  the united kingdom  the united states  australia and europe 
our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are generally subjected to additional regulatory restrictions as a result of their regulated status 
these laws and regulations require  among other things  certain of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries to maintain minimum solvency requirements and limit the amount of dividends and other payments that these subsidiaries can pay to us  which in turn may limit our ability to pay dividends and make other payments 
as of december  and  one of our us insurance companies was not in compliance with its applicable risk based capital level 
we do not believe this company s non compliance will have a material impact on our ability to meet our cash obligations 
with the exception of the above  all of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries solvency and liquidity were in excess of the minimum levels required as of december  and retained earnings of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries  with the exception of the one noncompliant company noted above  are not currently restricted as minimum capital solvency margins are covered by share capital and additional paid in capital 
our capital management strategy is to preserve sufficient capital to enable us to make future acquisitions while maintaining a conservative investment strategy 
we believe that restrictions on liquidity resulting from restrictions on the payments of dividends by our subsidiary companies will not have a material impact on our ability to meet our cash obligations 
our sources of funds primarily consist of the cash and investment portfolios acquired on the completion of the acquisition of an insurance or reinsurance company in run off 
these acquired cash and investment balances are classified as cash provided by investing activities 
we expect to use these funds acquired  together with collections from reinsurance debtors  consulting income  investment income and proceeds from sales and redemptions of investments  to pay losses and loss expenses  salaries and benefits and general and administrative expenses  with the remainder used for acquisitions and additional investments 
we expect a net use of cash from operations as total net claim settlements and operating expenses will generally be in excess of investment income earned 
we expect our operating cash flows  together with our existing capital base and cash and investments acquired on the acquisition of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries  to be sufficient to meet cash requirements and to operate our business 
we currently do not intend to pay cash dividends on our ordinary shares 

table of contents we maintain a short duration conservative investment strategy whereby  as of december   of our fixed maturity portfolio classified as available for sale or trading was held with a maturity of less than one year and had maturities of less than five years 
excluding the impact of commutations and any schemes of arrangement  should they be completed  we expect approximately of the gross reserves to be settled within one year and approximately of the reserves to be settled within five years 
however  our strategy of commuting our liabilities has the potential to accelerate the natural payout of losses to less than five years 
therefore  the relatively short duration investment portfolio is maintained in order to provide liquidity for commutation opportunities and preclude us from having to liquidate longer dated securities 
as a result  we do not anticipate having to sell longer dated investments in order to meet future policyholder liabilities 
at december   total cash and investments were billion  compared to billion at december  reinsurance recoverables our acquired insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries  prior to acquisition by us  used retrocessional agreements to reduce their exposure to the risk of reinsurance assumed 
we remain liable to the extent that retrocessionaires do not meet their obligations under these agreements  and therefore  we evaluate and monitor concentration of credit risk 
provisions are made for amounts considered potentially uncollectible 
the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance recoverable was million and million at december  and  respectively 
as of december  and  we had total reinsurance balances receivable of billion and million  respectively  of which million and million  respectively  were associated with one and two reinsurers  respectively  which each represented or more of total reinsurance balances receivable 
of the million receivable from the one reinsurer as at december   million is secured by a trust fund held for our benefit 
as at december   the one reinsurer had a credit rating of a 
in the event that all or any of the reinsuring companies  that have not secured their obligations  are unable to meet their obligations under existing reinsurance agreements  we will be liable for such defaulted amounts 
during and  we completed five and six acquisitions  respectively  of insurance companies in run off and entered into two and eight acquisitions of portfolios of insurance and reinsurance businesses in run off  respectively 
the stronger creditworthiness of acquired reinsurance receivables compared to reinsurance receivables at december   combined with the reduction in aggregate provisions for bad debt  resulted in a lower provision for uncollectible reinsurance at december  compared to the prior year 
the aggregate provision for uncollectible reinsurance balances receivable as at december  amounted to approximately of the total reinsurance balances receivable  before provisions for uncollectible reinsurance  compared to approximately at december  source of funds we primarily generate our cash from the acquisitions we complete 
these acquired cash and investment balances are classified as cash provided by investing activities 
we expect the net operating cash flows for us  to expiry  to be negative as we pay out cash in claims settlements and expenses in excess of cash generated via investment income and consulting fees
