our global vessel fleet the company continues a disciplined vessel construction  acquisition and replacement program that was initiated with the intent of assuring the company s presence in nearly all major oil and gas producing regions of the world through the replacement of aging vessels in the company s fleet with fewer  larger  and more technologically sophisticated vessels 
since calendar  the company has purchased and or constructed vessels at a total cost of approximately billion and at march   has an additional vessels under construction or committed to be purchased at a total cost of approximately million 
to date  the company has generally funded its vessel programs from its operating cash flows  funds provided by three private debt placements totaling million in senior unsecured notes  a million term bank loan  borrowings under revolving credit facilities  and various sales leaseback arrangements 
the company s strategy contemplates organic growth through the construction of vessels at a variety of shipyards worldwide and possible acquisitions of recently built vessels and or other owners and operators having attractive offshore supply vessels and or vessel operations 
the company has the largest number of new offshore supply vessels among its competitors in the industry  but it also has the largest number of older offshore supply vessels for which management regularly evaluates disposition and other alternatives 
the company intends to pursue its long term fleet replenishment and modernization strategy on a disciplined basis and  in each case  will carefully consider whether proposed investments and transactions have the appropriate risk reward profile 
the average age of the company s owned or chartered vessel fleet excluding joint venture vessels and vessels withdrawn from service in its fleet at march  is approximately years 
the average age of newer vessels in the fleet defined as those that have been acquired or constructed since calendar year as part of the company s new build and acquisition program as discussed below is approximately years 
the remaining vessels have an average age of years

at march   the company had agreements to acquire three vessels and commitments to build vessels at a number of different shipyards around the world with one of these vessels being constructed in the united states by the company s wholly owned shipyard  quality shipyards  llc at a total cost  including contract costs and other incidental costs  of approximately million 
of the new build vessels  two are anchor handling towing supply ahts vessels and have  brake horsepower bhp  are platform supply vessels psvs ranging between  and  deadweight tons of cargo capacity  one is a fast crew supply boat and four are crewboats 
scheduled delivery for these newbuild vessels began in april  with delivery of the final vessel expected in may the company currently is experiencing substantial delay with one fast  crew supply boat under construction in brazil that was originally scheduled to be delivered in september of a discussion of this matter is disclosed in the vessel count  dispositions  acquisitions and construction programs section of item and note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
of the three vessels to be purchased  all three are deepwater psvs 
the aggregate approximate purchase price for these vessels is million 
the company took possession of one of the psvs  which has  deadweight tons of cargo capacity  in april for a total cost of million and expects to take possession of the remaining two psvs  which have  deadweight tons of cargo capacity  in july and in september for a total aggregate cost of million 
at march   the company had invested million in progress payments towards the construction of vessels and million towards the purchase of the three psvs 
at march   the remaining expenditures necessary to complete construction of the vessels currently under construction based on contract prices and to fund the acquisition of the three vessels was million 
a discussion of the company s capital commitments  scheduled delivery dates and vessel sales is disclosed in the vessel count  dispositions  acquisitions and construction programs section of item and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the vessel count  dispositions  acquisitions and construction programs section of item also contains a table comparing the actual march  vessel count and the average number of vessels by class and geographic distribution during the three years ended march   and between april and march  the company also sold  primarily to buyers that operate outside of our industry  vessels 
most of the vessel sales were at prices that exceeded their carrying values 
the vessel sales were accompanied by sales restrictions on competition or else the company determined that the prospects of the vessel competing with our ongoing business were low 
in aggregate  proceeds from  and pre tax gains on  vessel dispositions during this period approximated million and million  respectively 
our vessel classifications our vessels regularly and routinely move from one operating area to another  often to and from offshore operating areas of different continents 
we disclose our vessel statistical information  such as revenue  utilization and average day rates  by vessel class 
listed below are our five major vessel classes along with a description of the type of vessels categorized in each class and the services the respective vessels typically perform 
tables comparing the average size of the company s marine fleet by class and geographic distribution for the last three fiscal years are included in item of this report 
deepwater vessels included in this vessel class are large typically greater than feet and or with at least  tons in dead weight cargo carrying capacity psvs and large  higher horsepower generally greater than  horsepower ahts vessels 
this vessel class is generally chartered to customers for use in transporting supplies and equipment from shore bases to deepwater and intermediate water depth offshore drilling rigs  platforms and other installations that operate in challenging environments and which typically involve complex projects 
platform supply vessels  which have large cargo capacities 
both below deck liquid mud tanks and dry bulk tanks and above deck cargo capacities  serve drilling and production facilities and support offshore construction and maintenance work 
the deepwater ahts vessels are equipped to tow drilling rigs and other 
table of contents 
index to financial statements marine equipment  as well as to set anchors for the positioning and mooring of drilling rigs 
due to the challenging environment that deepwater offshore rigs  platforms and other installations operate in  our deepwater ahts and psvs are outfitted with dynamic positioning anchorless station keeping capabilities  which are primarily driven by safety considerations that preclude vessels from physically mooring to the installations and because our customers demand a high level of safety and technological advancements to meet the more stringent regulatory standards especially in the wake of the deepwater horizon incident 
this class of vessel also includes specialty vessels that can support offshore well stimulation  construction work  subsea services and or have fire fighting capabilities and or accommodation facilities 
these vessels are generally available for routine supply and towing services but are outfitted and primarily intended for specialty services 
for example  these vessels can be equipped with a variety of lifting and deployment systems  including large capacity cranes  winches or reel systems 
included in the specialty vessel category is the company s one multi purpose platform supply vessel mpsv  which is designed for subsea service and construction support activities and which is significantly larger in size  more versatile  and more specialized than the psvs discussed above 
the mpsv also commands a higher day rate because the vessel has higher construction cost  operating costs and because of the aforementioned capabilities 
towing supply and supply vessels this is the company s largest fleet class by number of vessels 
included in this class are non deepwater towing supply vessels with horsepower below  bhp  and non deepwater platform supply vessels  or psvs that are generally less than feet 
the vessels in this class perform the same functions and services as their deepwater vessel class counterparts except they are generally chartered to customers for use in intermediate and shallow waters 
crewboats and utility vessels crewboats and utility vessels are chartered to customers for use in transporting personnel and supplies from shore bases to offshore drilling rigs  platforms and other installations 
these vessels are also often equipped for oil field security missions in markets where piracy  kidnapping or other potential violence presents a concern 
offshore tugs offshore tugs tow floating drilling rigs  assist in the docking of tankers  tow barges  assist pipe laying  cable laying and construction barges  and are used in a variety of other commercial towing operations  including towing barges carrying a variety of bulk cargoes and containerized cargo 
other vessels the company s other vessels included inshore tugs and production  line handling and various other special purpose vessels 
inshore tugs  which are operated principally within inland waters  tow drilling rigs to and from their locations and tow barges carrying equipment and materials for use principally in inland waters for drilling and production operations 
barges are either used in conjunction with company tugs or are chartered to others 
the company sold its remaining other type vessels during the first quarter of fiscal revenue contribution of main classes of vessels revenues from vessel operations were derived from the following classes of vessels in the following percentages year ended march  deepwater vessels towing supply supply crew utility offshore tugs

index to financial statements shipyard operations quality shipyards  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  operates two shipyards in houma  louisiana  that construct  upgrade and repair vessels 
the shipyards perform repair work and new construction work for third party customers  as well as the construction  repair and modification of the company s own vessels 
during the last three fiscal years  quality shipyards  llc has constructed and delivered three foot psvs  and is currently constructing one foot psv for the company that is scheduled for delivery in october one of the foot platform supply vessels was delivered in november  while the other two were delivered at various times during fiscal customers and contracting the company s operations are materially dependent upon the levels of activity in offshore crude oil and natural gas exploration  field development and production throughout the world  which is affected by trends in global crude oil and natural gas pricing  including expectations of future commodity pricing  which are ultimately influenced by the supply and demand relationship for these natural resources 
the activity levels of our customers are also influenced by the cost of exploring for and producing crude oil and natural gas  which can be affected by environmental regulations  technological advances that affect energy production and consumption  significant weather conditions  the ability of our customers to raise capital  and local and international economic and political environments  including government mandated moratoriums 
a discussion of current market conditions and trends appears under macroeconomic environment and outlook in item of this report 
the company s principal customers are major and independent oil and natural gas exploration  field development and production companies  foreign government owned or government controlled organizations and companies that explore and produce oil and natural gas  drilling contractors  and companies that provide other services to the offshore energy industry  including but not limited to  offshore construction companies  diving companies and well stimulation companies 
in recent years  consolidation of exploration  field development  and production companies has occurred which reduces the number of customers for the company s vessels and services  and may negatively affect exploration  field development and production activity as consolidated companies generally focus initially on increasing efficiency and reducing costs and delay or abandon exploration activity with less promise 
such activity could adversely affect demand for our vessels  and reduce the company s revenues 
this trend is likely to continue in the future  although for every merger in the industry  there is frequently a start up company that takes the place of the merged company  in numerical terms  if not in levels of activity 
our primary source of revenue is derived from time charter contracts on our vessels on a rate per day of service basis  therefore  vessel revenues are recognized on a daily basis throughout the contract period 
as noted above  these time charter contracts are generally either on a term or spot basis 
there are no material differences in the cost structure of the company s contracts based on whether the contracts are spot or term because the operating costs are generally the same without regard to the length of a contract 
the following table discloses our customers that accounted for or more of total revenues during the years ended march chevron corporation including its worldwide subsidiaries and affiliates petroleo brasileiro sa while it is normal for our customer base to change over time as our time charter contracts turn over  the unexpected loss of either or both of these two significant customers could  at least in the short term  have a material adverse effect on the company s vessel utilization and its results of operations 
the five largest customers of the company in aggregate accounted for approximately of our fiscal total revenues  while the largest customers in aggregate accounted for approximately of the company s fiscal total revenues 

table of contents 
index to financial statements competition the principal competitive factors for the offshore vessel service industry are the suitability and availability of vessel equipment  price and quality of service 
in addition  the ability to demonstrate a strong safety record and attract and retain qualified and skilled personnel are also important competitive factors 
the company has numerous competitors in all areas in which it operates around the world  and the business environment in all of these markets is highly competitive 
the company s diverse  mobile asset base and the wide geographic distribution of its assets generally enable the company to respond relatively quickly to changes in market conditions and to provide a broad range of vessel services to its customers around the world 
we believe the company has a competitive advantage because of the size  diversity and geographic distribution of our vessel fleet 
economies of scale and experience level in the many areas of the world in which we operate are also considered competitive advantages as is the company s strong financial position 
according to ods petrodata  the global offshore supply vessel market at the end of april had approximately new build offshore support vessels psvs and anchor handlers only  under construction that are expected to be delivered to the worldwide offshore vessel market primarily over the next three years 
the current worldwide fleet of these classes of vessels is estimated at approximately  vessels  of which tidewater estimates more than are stacked 
an increase in worldwide vessel capacity could have the effect of lowering charter rates  particularly when there are lower levels of exploration  field development and production activity 
the worldwide offshore marine vessel industry  however  also has a large number of aged vessels  including approximately vessels  or  of the worldwide offshore fleet  that are at least years old and nearing or exceeding original expectations of their estimated economic lives 
these older vessels  approximately one third of which tidewater estimates are already stacked  could potentially be removed from the market within the next few years if the cost of extending the vessels lives is not economically justifiable 
although the future attrition rate of these aging vessels cannot be determined with absolute certainty  the company believes that the retirement of a sizeable portion of these aged vessels could mitigate the potential negative effects of new build vessels on vessel utilization and vessel pricing 
additional vessel demand could also be created by the addition of new drilling rigs and floating production units that are expected to be delivered and become operational over the next few years  which should help minimize the possible negative effects of the new build offshore support vessels being added to the offshore support vessel fleet 
challenges we confront as an international offshore vessel company we operate in many challenging operating environments around the world that present varying degrees of political  social  economic and other uncertainties 
we operate in markets where risks of expropriation  confiscation or nationalization of our vessels or other assets  terrorism  piracy  civil unrest  changing foreign currency exchange rates and controls  and changing political conditions  may adversely affect our operations 
although the company takes what it believes to be prudent measures to safeguard its property  personnel and financial condition against these risks  it cannot eliminate entirely the foregoing risks  though the wide geographic dispersal of the company s vessels helps reduce the potential impact of these risks 
in addition  immigration  customs  tax and other regulations and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof can have a material impact on our ability to work in certain countries and on our operating costs 
in some international operating environments  local customs or laws may require the company to form joint ventures with local owners or use local agents 
the company is dedicated to carrying out its international operations in compliance with the rules and regulations of the office of foreign assets control ofac  the trading with the enemy act  the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa  and other applicable laws and regulations 
the company has adopted policies and procedures to mitigate the risks of violating these rules and regulations 
sonatide joint venture the company has previously announced that its existing sonatide joint venture agreement with sonangol had been extended to may  to allow ongoing joint venture restructuring negotiations to continue 
the company has from time to time also provided updates regarding the status of its continuing negotiations with sonangol to put its sonatide joint venture on a more permanent footing after a number of temporary 
table of contents 
index to financial statements extensions of the original joint venture agreement 
as previously disclosed  in march  sonangol informed tidewater that it would not permit further vessel contracting activity by sonatide until the joint venture negotiations had been resolved to the parties mutual satisfaction 
as a result  the company has begun deploying vessels at prevailing market day rates to other markets as those vessels become available 
the company has recently exchanged proposals and is continuing discussions with sonangol 
in the most recent meeting between the two negotiating teams  only modest progress was made in the restructuring negotiations  and important and fundamental issues regarding the restructured relationship remain outstanding and unresolved 
in that meeting  sonangol and the company discussed a number of topics  up to and including the potential issues associated with a wind up of the existing joint venture in the event restructuring discussions are not ultimately successful 
if negotiations relating to putting the sonatide joint venture on a more permanent footing are ultimately unsuccessful  the company will work toward an orderly wind up of the joint venture 
we believe  however  that the joint venture would be allowed to honor existing vessel charter agreements through their contract terms 
even though the global market for offshore supply vessels appears to be well balanced and the market for deepwater supply vessels is currently strong  there would be financial impacts associated with the wind up of the existing joint venture and the possible redeployment of vessels to other markets  including mobilization costs and costs to redeploy tidewater shore based employees to other areas  in addition to lost revenues associated with potential downtime between vessel contracts 
these financial impacts could  individually or in the aggregate  be material to our results of operations and cash flows 
if there is a need to redeploy vessels which are currently deployed in angola to other international markets  tidewater believes that there is sufficient demand for these vessels at prevailing market day rates 
for the year ended march   tidewater s angolan operations generated vessel revenues of approximately million  or of its consolidated vessel revenue  from an average of approximately vessels of which were stacked on average in fiscal  and  for the year ended march   generated vessel revenues of approximately million  or of consolidated vessel revenue  from an average of approximately vessels of which were stacked on average in fiscal 
as of march   the carrying value of tidewater s investment in the sonatide joint venture  which is included in investments in  at equity  and advances to unconsolidated companies  is approximately million 
international labour organization s maritime labour convention the international labour organization s maritime labour convention  the convention seeks to mandate globally  among other things  seafarer working conditions  ship accommodations  wages  conditions of employment  health and other benefits for all ships and the seafarers on those ships that are engaged in commercial activities 
to date  this convention has been ratified by countries  namely  antigua and barbuda  australia  the bahamas  benin  bosnia and herzegovina  bulgaria  canada  croatia  denmark  kiribati  latvia  liberia  luxembourg  marshall islands  netherlands  norway  panama  poland  saint kitts and nevis  st 
vincent and the grenadines  singapore  spain  switzerland  togo and tuvalu 
instruments of ratification have been received but registration is pending for gabon 
the aforementioned countries represent more than of the world s vessel tonnage 
if member states ratify the convention  then  within months thereof  the convention will become law 
even though the company believes that the labor changes proposed by this convention are unnecessary in light of existing international labor laws that govern many of these issues  and the company continues to work with industry representatives to oppose ratification of this convention  the company continues to assess its seafarer labor relationships  including benefits provided  and to review its fleet operational practices in light of the convention requirements 
should this convention become law  the company and its customers operations may be negatively affected by future compliance costs

the company has a dual stock certificate system to protect against non us citizens owning more than of its common stock 
in addition  the company s charter provides the company with certain remedies with respect to any transfer or purported transfer of shares of the company s common stock that would result in the ownership by non us citizens of more than of its common stock 
based on information supplied to the company by its transfer agent  approximately of the company s outstanding common stock was owned by non us citizens as of march  the laws of the us require that vessels engaged in the us coastwise trade must be built in the us in addition  once a us built vessel is registered under a non us flag  it cannot thereafter engage in us coastwise trade 
therefore  the company s us flagged vessels must operate outside of the us coastwise trade 
of the total vessels owned or operated by the company at march   vessels were registered under flags other than the united states and vessels were registered under the us flag 
if the company is not able to secure adequate numbers of charters abroad for its non us flag vessels  even if work would otherwise have been available for such vessels in the united states  these vessels cannot operate in the us coastwise trade  and the company s financial performance could be affected 
all of the company s offshore vessels are subject to either united states or international safety and classification standards or sometimes both

vessels registered under flags other than the united states are subject to similar regulations and are governed by the laws of the applicable international jurisdictions and the rules and requirements of various classification societies  such as the american bureau of shipping 
the company is in compliance with the international ship and port facility security code isps  an amendment to the safety of life at sea solas convention  and further mandated in the maritime transportation and security act of to align united states regulations with those of solas and the isps code 
under the isps code  the company performs worldwide security assessments  risk analyses  and develops vessel and required port facility security plans to enhance safe and secure vessel and facility operations 
additionally  the company has developed security annexes for those us flag vessels that transit or work in waters designated as high risk by the united states coast guard pursuant to the latest revision of marsec directive environmental compliance during the ordinary course of business  the company s operations are subject to a wide variety of environmental laws and regulations that govern the discharge of oil and pollutants into navigable waters 
violations of these laws may result in civil and criminal penalties  fines  injunction and other sanctions 
compliance with the existing governmental regulations that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment has not had  nor is expected to have  a material effect on the company 
environmental laws and regulations are subject to change however  and may impose increasingly strict requirements and  as such  the company cannot estimate the ultimate cost of complying with such potential changes to environmental laws and regulations 
all vessels over feet in registered length  regardless of flag  that are operating as a means of transportation within the inland and offshore waters of the us but not beyond the three nautical mile territorial sea limit must comply with the environmental protection agency s national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes vessel general permit vgp for discharges incidental to the normal operation of vessels

the company is proactive in establishing policies and operating procedures for safeguarding the environment against any hazardous materials aboard its vessels and at shore based locations 
whenever possible  hazardous materials are maintained or transferred in confined areas in an attempt to ensure containment  if accidents were to occur 
in addition  the company has established operating policies that are intended to increase awareness of actions that may harm the environment 
safety we are committed to ensuring the safety of our operations for both our employees and our customers 
the company s principal operations occur in offshore waters where the workplace environment presents safety challenges 
because the work environment presents these challenges  the company works diligently to maintain workplace safety 
management regularly communicates with its personnel to promote safety and instill safe work habits through company media and safety review sessions 
we also regularly conduct safety training meetings for our seamen and shore based staff personnel 
we dedicate personnel and resources to ensure safe operations and regulatory compliance 
our director of health  safety and environmental management is involved in proactive efforts to prevent accidents and injuries and reviews all incidents that occur throughout the company 
in addition  the company employs safety personnel at every operating location who are responsible for administering the company s safety programs and fostering the company s safety culture 
we believe that every employee is a safety supervisor  and gives each employee the right  the responsibility  and the obligation to stop any operation that the employee deems to be unsafe  whether it is deemed to be  in retrospect  unsafe or not 
risk management the operation of any marine vessel involves an inherent risk of marine losses attributable to adverse sea and weather conditions  mechanical failure  and collisions  as well as  physical damage to the vessel 
in addition  the nature of our operations exposes the company to the potential risks of damage to and loss of drilling rigs and production facilities  hostile activities attributable to war  sabotage  pirates and terrorism  as well as business interruption due to political action or inaction  including nationalization of assets by foreign governments 
any such event may result in a reduction in revenues or increased costs 
the company s vessels are generally insured for their estimated market value against damage or loss  including war  acts of terrorism  and pollution risks  but the company does not fully insure for business interruption 
the company also carries workers compensation  maritime employer s liability  director and officer liability  general liability including third party pollution and other insurance customary in the industry 
the company seeks to secure appropriate insurance coverage at competitive rates by maintaining a self retention layer up to certain limits on its marine package policy 
the company carefully monitors claims and participates actively in claims estimates and adjustments 
estimated costs of self insured claims  which include estimates for incurred but unreported claims  are accrued as liabilities on our balance sheet 
the continued threat of terrorist activity and other acts of war or hostility have significantly increased the risk of political  economic and social instability in some of the geographic areas in which the company operates 
it is possible that further acts of terrorism may be directed against the united states domestically or abroad  and such acts of terrorism could be directed against properties and personnel of us owned companies such as ours 
the resulting economic  political and social uncertainties  including the potential for future terrorist acts and war  could cause the premiums charged for our insurance coverage to increase 
the company currently maintains war risk coverage on its entire fleet 
management believes that the company s insurance coverage is adequate 
the company has not experienced a loss in excess of insurance policy limits  however  there is no assurance that the company s liability coverage will be adequate to cover potential claims that may arise 
while the company believes that it should be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates considered commercially acceptable  it cannot guarantee such with the current level of uncertainty in the markets the company operates

index to financial statements raw materials the company s wholly owned subsidiary  quality shipyards  llc  performs both repair work and new construction work for outside customers  as well as the construction  repair and modification of the company s own vessels 
the shipyard operations require raw materials  such as alloy steels in various forms  welding gases  paint  fuels and lubricants  which are available from multiple sources and subject to price volatility 
the shipyard does not depend on any one supplier or source for any of these materials 
although shortages for some of these materials and fuels have occurred from time to time  no material shortage currently exists nor does the shipyard anticipate any shortages 
the commodity price for iron ore  the main component of steel  is typically volatile  and shortages may occur from time to time 
seasonality the company s global vessel fleet generally has its highest utilization rates in the warmer months when the weather is more favorable for offshore exploration  field development and construction work 
hurricanes  cyclones  monsoon season  and severe weather can impact operations 
the company s us gom operations can be impacted by the atlantic hurricane season from the months of june through november  when offshore exploration  field development and construction work tends to slow or halt in an effort to mitigate potential losses and damage that may occur to the offshore oil and gas infrastructure should a hurricane enter the us gom 
however  demand for offshore marine vessels typically increases in the us gom in connection with repair and remediation work that follows any hurricane damage to offshore crude oil and natural gas infrastructure 
the company s vessels that operate in southeast asia and pacific are impacted by the monsoon season  which moves across the region from november to april 
the vessels that operate in australia are impacted by cyclone season from november to april 
customers in this region  where possible  plan business activities around the cyclone season  however  australia generally has high trade winds during the non cyclone season and  as such  the impact of cyclone season on our operations is not significant 
although hurricanes  cyclones  monsoons and other severe weather can impact operations  the company s business volume is more dependent on crude oil and natural gas pricing  global supply of crude oil and natural gas  and demand conditions for the company s offshore marine services than any seasonal variation 
employees as of march   the company had approximately  employees worldwide 
the company strives to maintain excellent relations with its employees 
the company is not a party to any union contract in the united states but through several subsidiaries is a party to union agreements covering local nationals in several countries other than the united states 
in the past  the company has been the subject of a union organizing campaign for the us gom employees by maritime labor unions 
these union organizing efforts have abated  although the threat has not been completely eliminated 
if the employees in the us gom were to unionize  the company s flexibility in managing industry changes in the domestic market could be adversely affected

high demand for crude oil and natural gas  reductions in supplies and or low inventory levels for these resources as well as any perceptions about future supply interruptions can cause prices for crude oil and natural gas to rise 
conversely  low demand for crude oil and natural gas  increases in supplies and or increases in crude oil and natural gas inventories cause prices for crude oil and natural gas to decrease 
in addition  global military  political  and economic events  including civil unrest in the middle east and north africa oil producing and exporting countries  have contributed to crude oil and natural gas price volatility 
factors that affect the supply of crude oil and natural gas include  but are not limited to  the following global demand for the hydrocarbons  the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec ability to control crude oil production levels and pricing  as well as  the level of production by non opec countries  sanctions imposed by the us  the european union  or other governments against oil producing countries  political and economic uncertainties including wars  terrorist acts or security operations  advances in exploration and field development technologies  significant weather conditions  and governmental policies restrictions placed on exploration and production of natural resources 
prolonged material downturns in crude oil and natural gas prices and or perceptions of long term lower commodity prices can negatively impact the development plans of exploration and production companies given the long term nature of large scale development projects  which would likely result in a corresponding decline in demand for offshore support vessel services and a reduction in charter rates and or utilization rates  which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
higher commodity prices  however  do not necessarily translate into increased demand for offshore support vessel services as increased commodity supply could come from land based energy markets 
crude oil pricing volatility has increased in recent years as crude oil has emerged into a financial asset class used for speculative purchase 
traditionally  crude oil futures and options were purchased by the commercial traders for future production in an effort to hedge against price risk 
more recently  non commercial market participants have traded crude oil derivatives to profit off of the price performance of crude oil instead of traditional investments 
the extent to which speculation causes excessive crude oil pricing volatility is currently not fully known  however  there is a growing consensus that speculative purchase of crude oil futures and options helped push crude oil prices to record levels in mid changes in the level of capital spending by our customers our principal customers are major and independent oil and natural gas exploration  field development and production companies  foreign government owned or controlled organizations and companies that explore and produce oil and natural gas  drilling contractors  and companies that provide other services to the offshore energy industry  such as  offshore construction companies  diving companies and well stimulation companies 
demand for our vessels  and thus our results of operations are highly dependent on the level of capital spending for exploration and field development by the companies that operate in the energy industry 
the energy industry s level of capital spending is substantially related to current and expected future demand for hydrocarbons and the prevailing commodity prices of crude oil and  to a lesser extent  natural gas 
when 
table of contents 
index to financial statements commodity prices are low  or when our customers believe that they will be low in the future  our customers generally reduce their capital spending budgets for onshore and offshore drilling  exploration and field development 
the level of offshore crude oil and natural gas exploration  development and production activity has historically been volatile  and that volatility is likely to continue 
other factors that influence the level of capital spending by our customers that are beyond our control include worldwide demand for crude oil and natural gas  the cost of offshore exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas  which can be affected by environmental regulations  significant weather conditions  technological advances that affect energy production and consumption  local and international economic and political environment  the availability and cost of financing 
consolidation of the company s customer base oil and natural gas companies  energy companies and drilling contractors have undergone consolidation  and additional consolidation is possible 
consolidation reduces the number of customers for the company s equipment  and may negatively affect exploration  field development and production activity as consolidated companies focus on increasing efficiency and reducing costs and delay or abandon exploration activity with less promise 
such activity could adversely affect demand for the company s vessels and reduce the company s revenues 
the offshore marine service industry is highly competitive we operate in a highly competitive industry  which could depress vessel charter rates and utilization and adversely affect our financial performance 
we compete for business with our competitors on the basis of price  reputation for quality service  quality  suitability and technical capabilities of vessels  availability of vessels  safety and efficiency  cost of mobilizing vessels from one market to a different market  and national flag preference 
in addition  competition in international markets may be adversely affected by regulations requiring  among other things  local construction  flagging  ownership or control of vessels  the awarding of contracts to local contractors  the employment of local citizens and or the purchase of supplies from local vendors that favor or require local ownership 
in general  declines in the level of offshore drilling and development activity by the energy industry negatively affects the demand for our vessels and results in downward pressure on day rates 
extended periods of low vessel demand and or low day rates reduce the company s revenues 
risk associated with the loss of a major customer we derive a significant amount of revenue from a few customers 
for the years ended march   and  the five largest customers accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of the company s total revenues  while the largest customers accounted for a respective   and of our total revenues 
while it is normal for our customer base to change over time as our time charter contracts turn over  our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if one or more of these customers decide to interrupt or curtail their activities  terminate their contracts with us  fail to renew existing contracts  and or refuse to award new contracts  and we were unable to contract our vessels with new customers at comparable day rates 
unconventional natural gas sources are exerting downward pricing pressures on the price of natural gas the rise in production of unconventional gas resources onshore shale plays resulting from technological advancements in horizontal drilling and fracturing in north america and the commissioning of a number of new large liquefied natural gas lng export facilities around the world are contributing to an over supplied natural gas market 
while production of natural gas from unconventional sources is still a relatively small portion of the worldwide natural gas production  it is increasing because improved drilling efficiencies are lowering the costs of extraction 
there is a significant oversupply of natural gas inventories in the united states in part due to the increase of unconventional gas in the market 
prolonged increases in the worldwide supply of natural gas  whether from conventional or unconventional sources  will likely continue to weigh on natural gas prices 
a prolonged period of low natural gas prices would likely have a negative impact on development plans of exploration and production companies at least in regards to development plans primarily targeting natural gas  which in turn  may result in a decrease in demand for offshore support vessel services 
this effect could be particularly acute in our americas segments  specifically our shallow water us gom operations  which is 
table of contents 
index to financial statements more oriented towards natural gas than crude oil production  and therefore more sensitive to the changes in the market pricing for natural gas than to changes in the market pricing of crude oil 
challenging macroeconomic conditions uncertainty about future global economic market conditions makes it challenging to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments 
the success of our business is both directly and indirectly dependent upon conditions in the global financial and credit markets that are outside of our control and difficult to predict 
uncertain economic conditions may lead our customers to postpone capital spending in response to tighter credit and reductions in income or asset values 
similarly  when lenders and institutional investors reduce  and in some cases  cease to provide funding to corporate and other industrial borrowers  the liquidity and financial condition of our customers can be adversely impacted 
these factors may also adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 
factors such as interest rates  availability of credit  inflation rates  economic uncertainty  changes in laws including laws relating to taxation  trade barriers  commodity prices  currency exchange rates and controls  and national and international political circumstances including wars  terrorist acts or security operations can have a material negative effect on our business and operations  which in turn would reduce our revenues and profitability 
prolonged material economic downturns in crude oil and natural gas prices can negatively affect the development plans of exploration and production companies 
in addition  a prolonged recession may result in a decrease in demand for offshore support vessel services and a reduction in charter rates and or utilization rates  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
prior to mid  oil and gas companies had increased their respective exploration and field development activities in response to a very favorable pricing environment for oil and gas that existed at that time 
worldwide demand for crude oil and natural gas dropped precipitously and energy prices sharply declined as a result of a global economic recession 
several years later  there are signs that economic improvement is underway  however  the pace of recovery and demand for energy and  in turn  offshore supply vessel services is still recovering 
in addition  the recent increases in crude oil prices  resulting from higher demand for hydrocarbons and civil unrest in the middle east and north african oil producing and exporting countries  renewed economists concerns that high energy prices could imperil the economic recovery  although high commodity pricing generally bodes well for the energy industry 
potential overcapacity in the offshore marine industry over the past decade  as offshore exploration and production activities increasingly focused on deepwater well exploration  field development and production  offshore service companies  such as ours  constructed specialized offshore vessels that are capable of supporting complex deepwater and deep well defined by well depth rather than water depth projects that are generally located in challenging environments 
during this time  construction of offshore vessels increased significantly in order to meet customer demands 
excess offshore supply vessel capacity usually exerts downward pressure on charter day rates 
excess capacity can occur when newly constructed vessels enter the market and also when vessels migrate between market areas 
while the company is committed to the construction of additional vessels  it has also sold and or scrapped a significant number of vessels over the last several years 
a discussion about the aging of the company s fleet  which has necessitated the company s new vessel construction programs  appears in the vessel count  dispositions  acquisitions and construction programs section of item in this report 
the offshore supply vessel market has approximately new build offshore support vessels platform supply vessels and anchor handlers only  under construction that are expected to be delivered to the worldwide offshore vessel market primarily over the next three years  according to ods petrodata 
the current worldwide fleet of these classes of vessels is estimated at approximately  vessels  according to the same source 
an increase in vessel capacity could result in increased competition in the company s industry which may have the effect of lowering charter rates and utilization rates  which  in turn  would result in lower revenues to the company 
in addition  the provisions of the shipping act restricting engagement of us coastwise trade to vessels controlled by us citizens may from time to time be circumvented by foreign competitors that seek to engage in trade reserved for vessels controlled by us citizens and otherwise qualifying for coastwise trade 
a repeal  suspension or significant modification of the shipping act  or the administrative erosion of its benefits  permitting vessels that are either foreign flagged  foreign built  foreign owned  foreign controlled or foreign 
table of contents 
index to financial statements operated to engage in the us coastwise trade  could also result in excess vessel capacity and increased competition especially for our vessels that operate in north america 
risks associated with vessel construction and maintenance the company has a number of vessels currently under construction  and it may construct additional vessels in response to current and future market conditions 
in addition  the company routinely engages shipyards to drydock vessels for regulatory compliance and to provide repair and maintenance services 
construction projects and drydockings are subject to risks of delay and cost overruns  resulting from shortages of equipment  materials and skilled labor  lack of shipyard availability  unforeseen design and engineering problems  work stoppages  weather interference  unanticipated cost increases  unscheduled delays in the delivery of material and equipment  financial and other difficulties at shipyards including labor disputes and shipyard insolvency  and inability to obtain necessary certifications and approvals 
a significant delay in either construction or drydockings of vessels could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fulfill contract commitments and to realize timely revenues with respect to vessels under construction  conversion or other drydockings 
significant cost overruns or delays for vessels under construction could also adversely affect the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the demand for vessels currently under construction may diminish from levels originally anticipated 
if the company fails to obtain favorable contracts for newly constructed vessels  such failure could have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues and profitability 
also  difficult economic market conditions and or prolonged distress in credit and capital markets may hamper the ability of shipyards to meet their scheduled deliveries of new vessels or the ability of the company to renew its fleet through new vessel construction or acquisitions 
in addition  there is always the risk of insolvency of the shipyards that construct or drydock our vessels  which could adversely affect our new construction or repair programs  and consequently  adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
risks associated with operating internationally we operate in various regions throughout the world  which exposes us to many risks inherent in doing business in countries other than the united states  some of which have recently become more pronounced 
our customary risks of operating internationally include political and economic instability within the host country  possible vessel seizures or nationalization of assets and other governmental actions by the host country please refer to item in this report and note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for a discussion of our venezuelan operations regarding vessel seizures  foreign government regulations that favor or require the awarding of contracts to local competitors  an inability to recruit and retain management of overseas operations  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods  changing taxation policies  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  revaluations  devaluations and restrictions on repatriation of currency  and import export quotas and restrictions or other trade barriers most of which are beyond the control of the company 
the company is also subject to acts of piracy and kidnappings that put its assets and personnel at risk 
the increase in the level of these criminal or terrorist acts over the last few years has been well publicized 
as a marine services company that operates in offshore  coastal or tidal waters  the company is particularly vulnerable to these kinds of unlawful activities 
although the company takes what it considers to be prudent measures to protect its personnel and assets in markets that present these risks  it has confronted these kinds of incidents in the past  and there can be no assurance it will not be subjected to them in the future 
the continued threat of terrorist activity and other acts of war or hostility have significantly increased the risk of political  economic and social instability in some of the geographic areas in which the company operates 
it is possible that further acts of terrorism may be directed against the united states domestically or abroad and such acts of terrorism could be directed against properties and personnel of us owned companies such as ours 
to date  the company has not experienced any material adverse effects on its results of operations and financial condition as a result of terrorism  political instability or war 

table of contents 
index to financial statements risks associated with doing business through joint ventures the company operates in several foreign areas through a joint venture with a local company  in some cases as a result of local laws requiring local company ownership 
while the joint venture partner may provide local knowledge and experience  entering into joint ventures inevitably requires us to surrender a measure of control over the assets and operations devoted to the joint venture  and occasions may arise when we do not agree with the business goals and objectives of our partner or other factors may arise that make the continuation of the relationship unwise or untenable 
any such disagreements or discontinuation of the relationship could disrupt our operations and affect the continuity of our business 
if we are unable to resolve issues with a joint venture partner  we may decide to terminate the joint venture and either locate a different partner and continue to work in the area or seek opportunities for our vessels in another area 
the unwinding of an existing relationship could prove to be difficult or time consuming  and the loss of revenue related to the termination or unwinding of a joint venture and costs related to the sourcing of a new partner or the mobilization of vessels to another area could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
international operations exposed to currency devaluation and fluctuation risk since we are a global company  our international operations are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks on all charter hire contracts denominated in foreign currencies 
for some of our international contracts  a portion of the revenue and local expenses are incurred in local currencies and the company is at risk of changes in the exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies 
we generally do not hedge against any foreign currency rate fluctuations associated with foreign currency contracts that arise in the normal course of business  which exposes us to the risk of exchange rate losses 
gains and losses from the revaluation of our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than our functional currency are included in our consolidated statements of operations 
foreign currency fluctuations may cause the us dollar value of our us results of operations and net assets to vary with exchange rate fluctuations 
this could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial position 
in addition  fluctuations in currencies relative to currencies in which the earnings are generated may make it more difficult to perform period to period comparisons of our reported results of operations 
to minimize the financial impact of these items  the company attempts to contract a significant majority of its services in us dollars 
in addition  the company attempts to minimize its financial impact of these risks  by matching the currency of the company s operating costs with the currency of revenue streams when considered appropriate 
the company continually monitors the currency exchange risks associated with all contracts not denominated in us dollars 
operational hazards inherent to the offshore marine vessel industry the operation of any marine vessel involves inherent risk that could adversely affect our financial performance if we are not adequately insured or indemnified 
our operations are also subject to various operating hazards and risks  including risk of catastrophic marine disaster  adverse sea and weather conditions  mechanical failure  navigation errors  collisions and property losses to the vessel  damage to and loss of drilling rigs and production facilities  war  sabotage  pirate and terrorism risks  and business interruption due to political action or inaction  including nationalization of assets by foreign governments 
these risks present a threat to the safety of personnel and to our vessels  cargo  equipment under tow and other property  as well as the environment 
any such event may result in a reduction in revenues  increased costs  property damage  and additionally  third parties may have significant claims against us for damages due to personal injury  death  property damage  pollution and loss of business 
we carry what we consider to be prudent levels of liability insurance and our vessels are generally insured for their estimated market value against damage or loss  including war  terrorism acts  and pollution risks  but the company does not fully insure for business interruption 
our insurance coverages are subject to deductibles and certain exclusions 
we can provide no assurance  however  that our insurance coverages will be available beyond the renewal periods  that we will be able to obtain insurance for all operational risks and that our insurance policies will be adequate to cover future claims that may arise 

table of contents 
index to financial statements compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide anti bribery laws our global operations require us to comply with a number of us and international laws and regulations  including those involving anti bribery and anti corruption 
in order to effectively compete in certain foreign jurisdictions  the company seeks to establish joint ventures with local operators or strategic partners 
as a us corporation  we are subject to the regulations imposed by the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa  which generally prohibits us companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or obtaining an improper business benefit 
we have adopted proactive procedures to promote compliance with the fcpa  but we may be held liable for actions taken by our strategic or local partners or agents even though these partners or agents may not themselves be subject to the fcpa 
any determination that we have violated the fcpa or any other applicable anti bribery laws in countries in which the company does business could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and cash flows 
a discussion of the company s fcpa internal investigation is disclosed in the completion of internal investigation and settlements with united states and nigerian agencies section of note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
compliance with complex and developing laws and regulations our operations are subject to many complex and burdensome laws and regulations 
stringent federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations governing worker health and safety and the manning  construction and operation of vessels significantly affect our operations 
many aspects of the marine industry are subject to extensive governmental regulation by the united states coast guard and the united states customs and border protection and their foreign equivalents  and to regulation by private industry organizations such as the american bureau of shipping  the oil companies international marine forum  and the international marine contractors association 
our operations are also subject to federal  state  local and international laws and regulations that control the discharge of pollutants into the environment or otherwise relate to environmental protection 
compliance with such laws and regulations may require installation of costly equipment  increased manning or operational changes 
some environmental laws impose strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of oil and hazardous substances  which could subject the company to liability without regard to whether the company was negligent or at fault 
further  many of the countries in which the company operates have laws  regulations and enforcement systems that are largely undeveloped  and the requirements of these systems are not always readily discernable even to experienced and proactive participants 
further  these laws  regulations and enforcement systems can be unpredictable and subject to frequent change or reinterpretation  sometimes with retroactive effect  and with associated taxes  fees  fines or penalties sought from the company based on that reinterpretation or retroactive effect 
while the company endeavors to comply with applicable laws and regulations  the company s compliance efforts might not always be wholly successful  and failure to comply may result in administrative and civil penalties  criminal sanctions  imposition of remedial obligations or the suspension or termination of the company s operations 
these laws and regulations may expose the company to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others  including charterers or third party agents 
moreover  these laws and regulations could be changed or be interpreted in new  unexpected ways that substantially increase costs that the company may not be able to pass along to its customers 
any changes in laws  regulations or standards that would impose additional requirements or restrictions could adversely affect the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in order to meet the continuing challenge of complying with applicable laws and regulations in jurisdictions where it operates  the company revitalized and strengthened its compliance training  makes available and uses a worldwide compliance reporting system and performs compliance auditing monitoring 
the company appointed its general counsel as its chief compliance officer in fiscal to help organize and lead these compliance efforts 
this strengthened compliance program may from time to time identify past practices that need to be changed or remediated 
such corrective or remedial measures could involve significant expenditures or lead to changes in operational practices that could adversely affect the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we are subject to the merchant marine act of  which provides that  upon proclamation by the president of the united states of a national emergency or a threat to the security of the national defense  the secretary of transportation may requisition or purchase any vessel or other watercraft owned by us citizens including 
table of contents 
index to financial statements us corporations  including vessels under construction in the united states 
if our vessels were purchased or requisitioned by the us federal government  we would be entitled to be paid the fair market value of the vessels in the case of a purchase or  in the case of a requisition  the fair market value of charter hire  but we would not be entitled to be compensated for any consequential damages suffered 
although the purchase or requisition of one or a few of our vessels for an extended period of time will not cause adverse material negative financial effects to our company  the purchase or requisition of several or a significant number of our vessels for an extended period of time may adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
risk of changes in laws governing us taxation of foreign source income we operate globally through various subsidiaries which are subject to changes in applicable tax laws  treaties or regulations in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business  including laws or policies directed toward companies organized in jurisdictions with low tax rates 
we determine our income tax expense based on our interpretation of the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in each jurisdiction for the period during which we operate and earn income 
a material change in the tax laws  tax treaties  regulations or accounting principles  or interpretation thereof  in one or more countries in which we conduct business  or in which we are incorporated or a resident of  could result in a higher effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings  and such change could be significant to our financial results 
in addition  our overall effective tax rate could be adversely and suddenly affected by lower than anticipated earnings in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated earnings in countries where we have higher statutory rates  or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities 
over of the company s revenues and net income are generated by its operations outside of the united states 
the company s effective tax rate has averaged approximately since fiscal  primarily a result of the passage of the american jobs creation act of  which excluded from the company s current taxable income in the us income earned offshore through the company s controlled foreign subsidiaries 
periodically  tax legislative initiatives are proposed to effectively increase us taxation of income with respect to foreign operations 
whether any such initiatives will win congressional or executive approval and become law is presently unknown  however  if any such initiatives were to become law  and were such law to apply to the company s international operations  it would result in a materially higher tax expense  which would have a material impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows  and which could cause the company to review the utility of continued us domicile 
in addition  our income tax returns are subject to review and examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities where tax returns are filed 
the company routinely evaluates the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes 
we do not recognize the benefit of income tax positions we believe are more likely than not to be disallowed upon challenge by a tax authority 
if any tax authority successfully challenges our operational structure or intercompany transfer pricing policies  or if the terms of certain income tax treaties are interpreted in a manner that is adverse to our structure  or if we lose a material tax dispute in any country  our effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings could increase  and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
compliance with environmental regulations may adversely impact our operations and markets a variety of regulatory developments  proposals and requirements have been introduced in the us and various other countries that are focused on restricting the emission of carbon dioxide  methane and other gases 
if such legislation is enacted  increased cost of energy as well as environmental and other costs and capital expenditures could be necessary to comply with the limitations 
these developments may curtail production and demand for hydrocarbons such as crude oil and natural gas in areas of the world where our customers operate and thus adversely affect future demand for the company s offshore supply vessels  which are highly dependent on the level of activity in offshore oil and natural gas exploration  development and production market 
although it is unlikely that demand for oil and gas will lessen dramatically over the short term  in the long term  demand for oil and gas or increased regulation of environmental regulations may create greater incentives for use of alternative energy sources 
unless and until legislation is enacted and its terms are known  we cannot reasonably or reliably estimate its impact on our financial condition  results of operations and ability to compete 
however  any long term material adverse effect on the crude oil and natural gas industry may adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows

index to financial statements the deepwater horizon incident and the aftereffects of the drilling moratorium in the us gom could have a material impact on exploration and production activities in united states coastal waters the success and profitability of our operations in the united states are dependent on the level of upstream drilling and exploration activity in the us gom  and to a lesser extent on the west coast of the united states and in alaska 
in particular  many of our new build vessels were designed to operate in deep water off the continental shelf to assist in drilling and exploration efforts in that area 
the margins we earn on our deepwater vessels have typically been higher than margins we achieve on other classes of our vessels 
although the boemre is now issuing new drilling permits  the new regulations and requirements could suppress the level of drilling activity and demand for our services  which could have a material adverse effect on our us operations which are part of our americas segment 
in addition  if exploration and production activity migrates from the us gom to international markets because of the these additional regulations and resulting increase in operating costs in the us gom  it is also possible that other offshore supply vessel owners will redeploy their respective vessels to international markets where we operate 
these mobilizations would increase competition and thus could negatively affect our vessel utilization and day rates in international markets  depending on the number of drilling rigs that exit the us gom and move to international markets 
also among the uncertainties that confront the industry are whether congress will repeal the million cap for non reclamation liabilities under the oil pollution act of and whether insurance will continue to be available at a reasonable cost and with reasonable policy limits to support drilling and exploration activity in the us gom 
although the eventual outcome of these developments is currently unknown  we believe that  even in the best case for the industry that we serve  additional regulatory and operational costs will be incurred  and these additional costs may either reduce the level of exploratory activity in the us gom  reduce demand for our services  or both

the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s future results of operations could differ materially from its historical results or those anticipated in its forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under risk factors in item a and elsewhere in this report 
with respect to this section  the cautionary language applicable to such forward looking statements described in forward looking statements found before item of this report is incorporated by reference into this item the following discussion should also be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures of this report 
fiscal business highlights and key focus during fiscal the company continued to focus on maintaining its competitive advantages and its market share in international markets  and continued to modernize its vessel fleet to increase future earnings capacity while removing from active service certain older  or traditional  vessels that currently have fewer market opportunities 
key elements of the company s strategy continue to be the preservation of its strong financial position and the maintenance of adequate liquidity to fund the expansion of its fleet of newer vessels 
operating management focused on safe operations  minimizing unscheduled downtime  and maintaining disciplined cost control 
the company s strategy contemplates the possible acquisitions of vessels and or other owners and operators of offshore supply vessels as well as organic growth through the construction of vessels at a variety of shipyards worldwide 
the company has the largest number of new vessels among its competitors in the industry  and it also has the largest fleet of older vessels in the industry 
management regularly evaluates alternatives for its older fleet 
the company intends to pursue its long term fleet replenishment and modernization strategy on a disciplined basis and  in each case  will carefully consider whether proposed investments and transactions have the appropriate risk reward profile 
during the quarter ended september   our international and united states segments were revised to form four new operating segments 
we now manage and measure our business performance in four distinct operating segments which are based on our geographical organization americas  asia pacific  middle east north africa  and sub saharan africa europe 
the new segments are reflective of how the company s chief operating decision maker reviews operating results for the purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance 
management decided to reorganize its reporting segments largely because the company s sub saharan africa europe and latin american business regions had gained greater significance as a percentage of consolidated revenues and operating profit  while our former united states segment had decreased in its significance to consolidated revenues and operating profit 
prior period disclosures have been recast to reflect the change in reportable segments 
although the company s revenue during fiscal increased million  or a modest  over the revenues earned during fiscal  the company s consolidated net earnings decreased  or million  during fiscal  reflecting a million non cash goodwill impairment charge million after tax  or per share recorded during the quarter ended september  on the company s middle east north africa segment as disclosed in note of notes consolidated financial statements included in part i  item of this report  an million  or  increase in general and administrative expenses  and million  or  higher interest and debt costs as disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
partially offsetting the increase in these expenses was a million  or  increase in gain on asset dispositions  net  and a  or million  reduction in income taxes due to the expiration of statutes of limitations with respect to tax liabilities that had been established previously for uncertain tax positions as disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements and due to lower earnings before income taxes 
other operating revenues increased approximately million  or  during the same comparative periods primarily because ship construction at the company s shipyards increased during the current period

we continued our vessel construction and acquisition program during fiscal that had begun in calendar year this program facilitated the company s entrance into deepwater markets around the world in addition to allowing the company to begin to replace its core towing supply supply fleet with fewer  larger  and more technologically sophisticated vessels in order to meet our customers needs 
the vessel construction and acquisition program was initiated with the intent of strengthening the company s presence in all major oil and gas producing regions of the world through the replacement of aging vessels in the company s core fleet 
during this time  the company has purchased and or constructed vessels at a total cost of approximately billion 
between april and march  the company also sold  primarily to buyers that operate outside of our industry  vessels 
most of the vessel sales were at prices that exceeded their carrying values 
the vessel sales were accompanied by sales restrictions on competition or else the company determined that the prospects of the vessel competing with our ongoing business were low 
in aggregate  proceeds from  and pre tax gains on  vessel dispositions during this period approximated million and million  respectively 
in recent years  the company has generally funded vessel additions with operating cash flow  and funds provided by the july private placement of million  the september private placement of million  and the august  private placement of million in senior unsecured notes  borrowings under its revolving credit facilities and million bank term loan and various leasing arrangements 
at march   the company had agreements to acquire three vessels and commitments to build vessels at a number of different shipyards around the world with one of these vessels being constructed in the united states by the company s wholly owned shipyard  quality shipyards  llc at a total cost  including contract costs and other incidental costs  of approximately million 
at march   the company had invested million in progress payments towards the construction of vessels and million towards the purchase of three vessels 
at march   the remaining expenditures necessary to complete construction of the vessels currently under construction based on contract prices and to fund the acquisition of the three vessels was million

macroeconomic environment and outlook the primary driver of our business  and revenues  is the level of our customers capital and operating expenditures for oil and natural gas exploration  field development and production 
these expenditures  in turn  generally reflect our customers expectations for future oil and natural gas prices  economic growth  hydrocarbon demand and estimates of current and future oil and natural gas production 
the prices of crude oil and natural gas are critical factors in exploration and production e p companies decisions to contract drilling rigs and offshore service vessels in the various international markets or the us gom  with the various international markets being largely driven by supply and demand for crude oil  and the us gom being 
table of contents 
index to financial statements influenced both by the supply and demand for natural gas primarily in regards to shallow water activity and the supply and demand for crude oil primarily in regards to deepwater activity 
during fiscal  the price of crude oil increased as positive economic news related to consumer spending  improvements in employment data  and higher consumer confidence in the us indicated that the tenuous economic recovery may not be losing its momentum in the us in addition  crude oil prices increased during fiscal due to potential supply interruptions resulting from geopolitical tensions in the middle east as iran threatened to shut down the strait of hormuz in an effort to disrupt crude oil supplies as tension mounted between iran and other nations regarding proposed sanctions related to iran s nuclear programs 
prices for crude oil  however  eased slightly as the organization of petroleum exporting companies opec announced that member nation saudi arabia and other opec member nations would be ready to provide additional oil supply in an effort to stabilize crude oil prices should a blockage in the strait of hormuz occur 
although signs of an improved economy in the us  the world s largest consumer of crude oil  are promising  and opec  at its meeting held in december noted that global crude oil demand is forecast to improve in calendar year  there is still some downside risks to the global economic recovery due to fiscal and financial uncertainty in certain euro zone countries  a prolonged level of relatively high unemployment in the us and other advanced economies  and inflation risks in emerging economies 
based on these uncertainties  opec member nations agreed in december to maintain current crude oil production levels to ensure the supply and demand for crude oil is balanced 
in addition  at the middle east and north africa energy conference held in late january  opec further expressed that it will strive to meet consumer demand  crude oil market stability  and other coordinated efforts to ensure balanced global supply of crude oil at a time when  despite the economic uncertainties  long term demand for crude oil is expected to grow 
tidewater anticipates that its longer term utilization and day rate trends for its vessels will be correlated with demand for and the price of crude oil  which in late april  was trading around per barrel for west texas intermediate wti crude and around per barrel for intercontinental exchange ice brent crude 
high crude oil prices generally bode well for increases in drilling and exploration activity  which would support increases in demand for the company s vessels  both in the various global markets and the deepwater sectors of the us gom assuming the pace of permits continues to increase 
throughout fiscal  prices for natural gas were weak due to the rise in production of unconventional gas resources in north america in part due to increases in onshore shale production resulting from technological advancements in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing and the commissioning of a number of new  large  liquefied natural gas lng exporting facilities around the world  which have contributed to an over supplied natural gas market 
the price of natural gas trended lower during fiscal and as of mid april  natural gas was trading in the us in the to per mcf range down from the to range at the start of fiscal the price for natural gas trended lower as inventories for the resource trended higher because a considerable amount of natural gas is derived as a byproduct of drilling crude oil and natural gas liquids oriented wells in liquid rich basins onshore 
in addition  a relatively mild winter in north america and a slow start to winter in the euro zone depressed weather related demand for natural gas  thereby adding to supply growth 
natural gas inventories in the us continue to be well over stocked 
this dynamic exerts downward pricing pressures on natural gas prices in the us prolonged increases in the supply of natural gas whether the supply comes from conventional or unconventional natural gas production or gas produced as a by product of crude oil production will likely restrain prices for natural gas 
increases in onshore gas production along with a very slow offshore drilling and exploration permitting process in the us gom and prolonged downturn in natural gas prices can negatively impact the offshore exploration and development plans of e p companies  which in turn  would result in a decrease in demand for offshore support vessel services  primarily in the americas segment specifically our us operations where natural gas is the more predominant exploitable hydrocarbon resource 
certain oil and gas industry analysts are reporting in their e p expenditures both land based and offshore surveys that global capital expenditure budgets for e p companies are forecast to increase by at least over calendar year levels 
the surveys forecast that international capital spending budgets will increase approximately while north american capital spending budgets are forecast to increase approximately 
it is anticipated by these analysts that the north american capital budget increases will primarily be spent onshore rather than offshore  while international e p spending is expected to be largely offshore  with the strongest markets expected to include latin america  africa  europe  russia  and the middle east 
capital expenditure budgets incorporated into the spending surveys were based on an approximate wti and brent average prices per barrel of oil 
although e p companies are using an approximate

index to financial statements per mcf average natural gas price for their capital budgets  natural gas directed drilling is forecast to decline due to weak natural gas prices 
deepwater activity continues to be a significant segment of the global offshore crude oil and natural gas markets  and it is also a source of growth for the company 
deepwater activity in non us markets did not experience significant negative effects from the global economic recession  largely because deepwater oil and gas development typically involves significant capital investment and multi year development plans 
such projects are generally underwritten by the participating exploration  field development and production companies using relatively conservative assumptions relating to crude oil and natural gas prices 
these projects are  therefore  considered less susceptible to short term fluctuations in the price of crude oil and natural gas 
during the past few years  worldwide rig construction increased as rig owners capitalized on the high worldwide demand for drilling and low shipyard and financing costs 
reports published by ods petrodata in late april suggest that the worldwide movable drilling rig count currently estimated at approximately movable offshore rigs worldwide  approximately of which are designed to operate in deeper waters will increase as approximately new build offshore rigs that are currently on order and under construction are delivered primarily over the next three years 
of the estimated movable offshore rigs worldwide  approximately are currently working 
it is further estimated that approximately of the new build rigs are being built to operate in deeper waters  suggesting that the number of rigs designed to operate in deeper waters could grow in the coming years to nearly of the market 
investment is also being made in the floating production unit market  with approximately new floating production units currently under construction and expected to be delivered primarily over the next three years to supplement the current approximately floating production units worldwide 
according to ods petrodata  the global offshore supply vessel market at march  had approximately new build offshore support vessels platform supply vessels and anchor handlers only  under construction that are expected to be delivered to the worldwide offshore vessel market primarily over the next three years 
the current worldwide fleet of these classes of vessels is estimated at approximately  vessels  of which tidewater estimates more than are stacked 
an increase in worldwide vessel capacity would tend to have the effect of lowering charter rates  particularly when there are lower levels of exploration  field development and production activity 
the worldwide offshore marine vessel industry  however  also has a large number of aged vessels including approximately vessels  or  of the worldwide offshore fleet  that are at least years old and nearing or exceeding original expectations of their estimated economic lives 
these older vessels  approximately one third of which tidewater estimates are already stacked  could potentially be removed from the market within the next few years if the cost of extending the vessels lives is not economically justifiable 
although the future attrition rate of these aging vessels cannot be determined with certainty  the company believes that the retirement of a sizeable portion of these aged vessels could mitigate the potential combined negative effects of new build vessels on vessel utilization and vessel pricing 
additional vessel demand could also be created by the addition of new drilling rigs and floating production units that are expected to be delivered and become operational over the next few years  which should help minimize the possible negative effects of the new build offshore support vessels being added to the offshore support vessel fleet 
principal factors that drive our revenues the company s revenues  net earnings and cash flows from operations are largely dependent upon the activity level of its offshore marine vessel fleet 
as is the case with many other energy service companies  our business activity is largely dependent on the level of drilling and exploration activity of our customers 
our customers business activity  in turn  is dependent on crude oil and natural gas prices  which fluctuate depending on expected future levels of supply and demand for crude oil and natural gas  and on estimates of the cost to find  develop and produce reserves 
in addition  after the deepwater horizon incident in april  the level of drilling activity off the continental shelf of the united states us gulf of mexico gom declined while the us government evaluated the causes of the incident and announced a plan for enhanced regulatory and safety oversight as a condition to granting additional drilling and exploration permits 
the company s revenues in all segments are driven primarily by the company s fleet size  vessel utilization and day rates 
because a sizeable portion of the company s operating costs and its depreciation does not change proportionally with changes in revenue  the company s operating profit is largely dependent on revenue levels 

table of contents 
index to financial statements principal factors that drive our operating costs operating costs consist primarily of crew costs  repair and maintenance  insurance and loss reserves  fuel  lube oil and supplies and vessel operating lease expense 
fleet size  fleet composition  geographic areas of operation  supply and demand for marine personnel  and local labor requirements are the major factors which affect overall crew costs in all segments 
in addition  the company s newer  more technologically sophisticated anchor handling towing supply vessels and platform supply vessels generally require a greater number of specially trained  more highly compensated fleet personnel than the company s older  smaller and less sophisticated vessels 
the company believes that competition for skilled crew personnel may intensify as new build support vessels currently under construction increase the number of offshore vessels operating worldwide 
if competition for personnel intensifies  the company s crew costs will likely increase 
the timing and amount of repair and maintenance costs are influenced by customer demand  vessel age and drydockings mandated by regulatory agencies 
a certain number of periodic drydockings are required to meet regulatory requirements 
the company will generally incur drydocking costs only if economically justified  taking into consideration the vessel s age  physical condition  contractual obligations  current customer requirements and future marketability 
when the company elects to forego a required drydocking  it stacks and occasionally sells the vessel because it is not permitted to work without valid regulatory certifications 
when the company drydocks a productive vessel  the company not only foregoes vessel revenues and incurs drydocking costs  but also continues to incur vessel operating and depreciation costs 
in any given period  vessel downtime associated with drydockings and major repairs and maintenance can have a significant effect on the company s revenues and operating costs 
at times  vessel drydockings take on an increased significance to the company and its financial performance 
older vessels may require more frequent and more expensive repairs and drydockings 
newer vessels generally those built after  which now account for a majority of the company s revenues and vessel margin vessel revenues less vessel operating costs  can also require expensive drydockings  even in the early years of a vessel s useful life  due to the larger relative size and greater relative complexity of these vessels 
conversely  when the company stacks vessels  the number of drydockings in any period could decline 
the combination of these factors can affect drydock costs  which are primarily included in repair and maintenance expense  and incrementally increase the volatility of the company s revenues and operating income  thus making period to period comparisons more difficult 
although the company attempts to efficiently manage its fleet drydocking schedule  changes in the demand for and supply of shipyard services can result in heavy workloads at shipyards and inflationary pressure on shipyard pricing 
in recent years  increases in drydocking costs and days off hire due to vessels being drydocked have contributed to volatility in repair and maintenance costs and vessel revenue 
in addition  some of the more recently constructed vessels are now experiencing their first or second required regulatory drydockings 
insurance and loss reserves costs are dependent on a variety of factors  including the company s safety record and pricing in the insurance markets  and can fluctuate over time 
the company s vessels are generally insured for up to their estimated fair market value in order to cover damage or loss resulting from marine casualties  adverse weather conditions  mechanical failure  collisions  and property losses to the vessel 
the company also purchases coverage for potential liabilities stemming from third party losses with limits that it believes are reasonable for its operations 
insurance limits are reviewed annually and third party coverage is purchased based on the expected scope of ongoing operations and the cost of third party coverage 
fuel and lube costs can also fluctuate in any given period depending on the number and distance of vessel mobilizations  the number of active vessels off charter  drydockings  and changes in fuel prices 
the company also incurs vessel operating costs that are aggregated as other vessel operating costs 
these costs consist of brokers commissions  training costs and other miscellaneous costs 
brokers commissions are incurred primarily in the company s non united states operations where brokers sometimes assist in obtaining work for the company s vessels 
brokers generally are paid a percentage of day rates and  accordingly  commissions paid to brokers generally fluctuate in accordance with vessel revenue 
other costs include  but

other operating revenues increased approximately million  or  during the same comparative periods primarily because activity at the company s shipyards increased during the current period 
vessel operating costs during fiscal were comparable to those in fiscal crew costs decreased approximately  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily because the prior fiscal year included a million charge associated with the company s participation in the merchant navy officers pension fund mnopf as disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
repair and maintenance costs decreased  or million  during fiscal  because a greater number of drydockings were performed during fiscal year in particular  during fiscal  we performed four scheduled drydockings of our largest anchor handling towing supply vessels for an aggregate cost of million 
fuel  lube and supply costs increased  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to the mobilization of newly delivered vessels and because of vessel mobilizations between operating areas 
costs of other operating revenues increased million  or  during the same comparative periods primarily because ship construction activity at the company s shipyards increased during fiscal at march   the company had owned or chartered vessels excluding joint venture vessels and vessels withdrawn from service in its fleet with an average age of years 
the average age of newer vessels in the fleet defined as those that have been acquired or constructed since calendar year as part of the company s new build and acquisition program is years 
the remaining vessels have an average age of years 
during fiscal and  the company s newer vessels generated million and million  respectively  of consolidated revenue and accounted for  or million  and  or million  respectively  of total vessel margin vessel revenues less vessel operating costs 
vessel operating costs exclude depreciation on the company s new vessels of million and million  respectively  during the same comparative periods 
americas segment operations 
americas based vessel revenues decreased approximately  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to an approximate decrease in average day rates on the deepwater vessels operating in the americas and because a fewer number of vessels are operating in this segment after the transfer of deepwater vessels to other segments 
revenues on the deepwater vessels declined  or million  during the comparative periods 
in addition  revenues on our towing supply supply class of vessels also declined million  or  during the same comparative periods primarily due to a fewer number of vessels operating after vessel sales 
a million  or  increase in revenues generated by offshore tugs  during the same comparative periods  slightly offset revenue declines on the two aforementioned classes of vessels due to an eight percentage point increase in utilization and a increase in average day rates due to stronger demand for this type of vessel in the americas segment 
total utilization rates for the americas based vessels increased seven percentage points  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  however  this increase is primarily a result of the sale of older  stacked vessels from the americas fleet during this two year period 
vessel utilization rates are calculated by dividing the number of days a vessel works by the number of days the vessel is available to work 
as such  stacked vessels depressed utilization rates during the comparative periods because stacked vessels are considered available to work  and as such  are included in the calculation of utilization rates 
within the americas segment  the company continued to stack  and in some cases dispose of  vessels that could not find attractive charters 
at the beginning of fiscal  the company had americas based stacked vessels 
during fiscal  the company stacked six additional vessels and sold vessels from the previously stacked vessel fleet  resulting in a total of stacked americas based vessels as of march  
table of contents 
index to financial statements vessel operating profit for the americas based vessels increased approximately  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  despite a decrease in revenues during the comparative periods  because of a  or million  decrease in vessel operating costs primarily crew costs  repair and maintenance costs  and other vessel costs and a decrease in depreciation expense  both of which offset the decline in revenues 
depreciation expense decreased approximately  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  because of the transfer of vessels to other segments and because of vessel sales 
crew costs decreased  or million  during the same comparative periods  due to reductions in crew personnel at our us gom operations as a result of fewer vessels operating in the us gom market due to the continued aftereffects of the drilling moratorium  and because the prior year s non us americas operations included an allocated million charge associated with the company s participation in the merchant navy officers pension fund mnopf as disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
repair and maintenance costs decreased approximately  or million  from the prior fiscal year  due to a fewer number of drydockings being performed during the current periods and because in the prior fiscal year we performed three scheduled drydockings of our largest anchor handling towing supply vessels for an aggregate cost of million 
asia pacific segment operations 
asia pacific based vessel revenues decreased approximately  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a five percentage point decrease in utilization rates on the towing supply supply class of vessels as a result of weaker demand  particularly for older equipment within this class of vessels and because of vessels transferred out of the segment  which collectively resulted in a million decrease in vessel revenues on the asia pacific region s non deepwater towing supply supply class of vessels 
revenues on the deepwater vessels also declined million due to a two percentage point decrease in utilization rates on the deepwater vessels operating in this segment  largely due to unanticipated delays on certain customer projects 
within the asia pacific segment  the company also continued to stack  and in some cases dispose of  vessels that could not find attractive charters 
at the beginning of fiscal  the company had asia pacific based stacked vessels 
during fiscal  the company stacked three additional vessels and sold six vessels from the previously stacked vessel fleet  resulting in a total of stacked asia pacific based vessels as of march  asia pacific based vessel operating profit decreased million  or  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to lower revenues and higher general and administrative expenses 
declines in revenues were partially offset by an approximate  or million  decrease in vessel operating costs primarily crew costs  repair and maintenance costs  and fuel  lube and supply costs and also due to a decrease in depreciation expense during the same comparative periods 
crew costs decreased approximately  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  due to reductions in crew personnel related to the transfer of deepwater vessels to other segments

middle east north africa segment operations 
middle east north africa based vessel revenues increased approximately  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a five percentage point increase in utilization rates on the deepwater vessels operating in this segment 
this resulted in an million increase in deepwater vessel revenues and reflects three deepwater vessels being transferred into the region from other segments during the comparative periods

the company s consolidated net earnings during fiscal decreased  or million  as compared to fiscal  due primarily to an approximate  or million  decrease in total revenues  a million  or  increase in vessel operating costs  and a million  or  increase in income taxes during the comparative periods as disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
during fiscal vessel utilization rates decreased approximately four percentage points as compared to fiscal due principally to reduced demand for the company s older vessels by our customers 
e p customers reduced their capital spending budgets in response to lower hydrocarbon demand and weaker commodity prices precipitated by the global economic recession 
the global recession resulted in a decrease in demand for offshore support vessel services worldwide 
this reduced demand has led to an industry wide reduction in charter rates and utilization rates on vessels as our customers needed fewer vessels and demanded pricing concessions 
the company recorded billion in revenues during fiscal as compared to billion in fiscal  a decrease of approximately million  primarily due to an approximate four percentage point reduction in total worldwide utilization and a decrease in the company s shipyard activity for unaffiliated customers 
in part  the decline in revenues reflected the vessel seizures in venezuela in mid with fiscal including million of revenues that were generated by the company s venezuelan operations 
other operating revenues decreased approximately million  or  during the same comparative periods primarily because ship construction at the company s shipyards was completed on several projects and the shipyard has not been able to secure additional backlog 
vessel operating costs increased  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal crew costs increased approximately  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  because of the addition of new vessels to the worldwide fleet 
the newer  more technologically sophisticated vessels generally require a greater number of specially trained fleet personnel than the older  traditional vessels 
in addition  crew costs increased during the same comparative periods  in part  due to a million charge

repair and maintenance costs also increased approximately  or million  during the same comparative periods  because a greater number of drydockings were performed during fiscal year in particular  during fiscal  we performed four scheduled drydockings of our largest anchor handling towing supply vessels for an aggregate cost of million as compared to one drydocking being performed on the same class of vessel during fiscal for a total cost of million 
vessel operating lease costs increased approximately million  or  during fiscal because the company entered into six additional vessel operating leases during fiscal  as disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements and in the off balance sheet arrangements section of this report 
fuel  lube and supply costs were higher by approximately  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  due to vessel mobilizations on the company s newly delivered vessels and because of vessel transfers 
insurance and loss reserves increased approximately million due to an increase in the number of vessels operating and due to unfavorable development of losses during fiscal costs of other operating revenues decreased approximately million  or  during the same comparative periods because ship construction at the company s shipyards was completed on several projects and the shipyard has not been able to secure additional backlog 
at march   the company had owned or chartered vessels excluding joint venture vessels and vessels withdrawn from service in its fleet with an average age of years 
the average age of newer vessels in the fleet at march  defined as those that have been acquired or constructed since calendar year as part of the company s new build and acquisition program was years 
the remaining vessels had an average age of years

vessel operating costs exclude depreciation on the company s new vessels of million and million  respectively  during the same comparative periods 
americas segment operations 
vessel revenues in the americas segment decreased approximately  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a six percentage point decrease in utilization rates on the towing supply supply class of vessels operating in the americas which resulted in a million decline in revenue mostly due to vessel sales  the transfer of vessels to other segments and weaker demand for this class of vessel particularly the older towing supply supply vessels 
in addition  revenues in the americas decreased during fiscal because of the loss of revenue resulting from the seizure of its venezuelan operations including the seizure of vessels as disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
our venezuelan operations contributed no revenues during fiscal as compared to million of revenues contributed during fiscal within the americas segment  the company stacked and disposed of a number of vessels that could not find attractive charters 
at the beginning of fiscal  the company had americas based stacked vessels 
during fiscal  the company stacked additional vessels  sold vessels from the previously stacked vessel fleet  and returned to service five vessels resulting in a total of stacked americas based vessels as of march  vessel operating profit for the americas based vessels increased approximately  or million  because fiscal vessel operating profit includes a million provision for venezuelan operations as disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
excluding the venezuelan provision from the comparatives  vessel operating profit for the americas based vessels decreased approximately  or million  primarily due to lower revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal and due to a  or million  increase in vessel operating costs primarily repair and maintenance costs and other vessel costs partially offset by lower crew costs and fuel  lube and supply costs partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense 
repair and maintenance costs increased approximately  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal due to a greater number of drydockings being performed during the current fiscal year 
in particular  during fiscal  we performed three scheduled drydockings of our largest anchor handling towing supply vessels for an aggregate cost of million as compared to one drydocking being performed on the same class of vessel during fiscal for a total cost of million 
other vessel costs increased  or million  due primarily to the movement of several older vessels out of brazil after the charters for these vessels had been completed 
a number of these vessels were subsequently disposed of

index to financial statements depreciation expense decreased approximately  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal because of the transfer of vessels to other segments and because of vessel sales 
crew costs decreased approximately  or million  during the same comparative periods  primarily due to fewer vessels operating in the americas because of vessel sales  vessel transfers to other segments  and the seizure of our venezuelan fleet of vessels 
in addition  crew costs were lower during the comparative periods in the americas due to the mobilization of two deepwater vessels from the us gom to other segments because vessel demand related to the deepwater horizon oil spill containment effort had declined significantly and because of wage reductions for remaining personnel operating in the us gom 
fuel  lube and supply costs decreased approximately  or million  during the same comparative periods because we had a fewer number of newly delivered vessels mobilize into the americas and a fewer number of intersegment mobilizations 
asia pacific segment operations 
asia pacific based vessel revenues increased approximately  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to an approximate increase in average day rates and a two percentage point increase in utilization rates on our deepwater vessels along with an increase in the number of deepwater vessels operating in asia pacific segment following the addition of newly built and acquired deepwater vessels and the transfer of deepwater class vessels from other segments  which collectively resulted in a million increase in revenue on this class of vessels 
revenue declines on our non deepwater towing supply supply class of vessels partially offset the revenues earned on the deepwater class vessels 
revenues on the towing supply supply vessels declined million  or  during the same comparative periods  due to a percentage point decrease in utilization rates as a result of weaker demand for this class of vessel specifically the older vessels in this class despite a increase in average day rates on this class of vessel 
in fiscal  the company stacked  and in a number of cases disposed of  asia pacific based vessels that could not find attractive charters 
at the beginning of fiscal  the company had asia pacific based stacked vessels 
during fiscal  the company stacked additional vessels and sold seven vessels from the previously stacked vessel fleet  resulting in a total of stacked asia pacific based vessels as of march  asia pacific based vessel operating profit decreased approximately million  or  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to higher vessel operating costs  depreciation expense and general and administrative costs despite an increase in revenues 
vessel operating costs increased  or million  during the same comparative periods primarily crew costs  repair and maintenance costs  and fuel  lube and supply costs 
depreciation expense increased  or million  during the same comparative periods  due to an increase in the number of vessels operating in the segment as a result of vessel transfers and the delivery of newly built vessels 
general and administrative expenses increased approximately  or million  during the same comparative periods  due to pay raises for the administrative personnel and temporary personnel staffing  an increase in office and property costs  and general increases caused by the devaluation of the us dollar relative to the australian dollar 
crew costs increased approximately  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  due to an increase in crew personnel related to the transfer of vessels into the segments and because of an allocated million charge associated with the company s participation in the merchant navy officers pension fund mnopf as disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
repair and maintenance costs increased  or million  during the same comparative periods due to a greater number of drydockings being performed during fiscal including a previously scheduled drydocking on one of our largest anchor handling towing supply vessels for a cost of million

index to financial statements middle east north africa segment operations 
middle east north africa vessel revenues in fiscal were comparable to the revenues earned during fiscal however  revenues on our towing supply supply vessels increased  or million  due to an increase in the number of towing supply supply vessels operating in this segment  while a decrease in revenues generated by our offshore tugs almost offset the revenue gains achieved by the towing supply supply class of vessels 
in particular  revenues generated by the offshore tugs declined approximately  or million  due to a seven percentage point decrease in utilization and a decrease in average day rates due to market weakness on this class of vessel 
within the middle east north africa segment  the company also stacked and disposed of a number of vessels that could not find attractive charters 
at the beginning of fiscal  the company had three middle east north africa based stacked vessels 
during fiscal  the company stacked six additional vessels  sold two vessels from the previously stacked vessel fleet  and returned to service one vessel resulting in a total of six stacked middle east north africa based vessels as of march  middle east north africa based vessel operating profit decreased million  or  during fiscal as compared to fiscal due primarily to a  or million  increase in vessel operating costs primarily crew costs and fuel  lube and supply costs and a  or million  increase in depreciation expense primarily because of the addition of approximately newly delivered vessels and due to vessels mobilizing into the segment from other segments 
crew costs increased million  or  because of an increase in crew personnel resulting from an increase in the number of vessels operating in the segment

sub saharan africa europe segment operations 
sub saharan africa europe based vessel revenues decreased approximately  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a percentage point decrease in utilization rates and a decrease in average day rates on the towing supply supply class of vessels resulting in a million  or  decline in revenue on this class of vessels  largely due to weak demand for this vessel class particularly the older vessels 
the decline in the towing supply supply class of vessel revenues was partially offset by a  or million  increase in revenue earned by the deepwater vessels due to the addition of deepwater vessels throughout fiscal and fiscal following the addition of newly built and acquired deepwater vessels to the sub saharan africa europe based fleet and the transfer of deepwater class vessels from other segments 
the company continued to stack and dispose of sub saharan africa europe based vessels that could not find attractive charters 
at the beginning of fiscal  the company had sub saharan africa europe based stacked vessels 
during fiscal  the company stacked additional vessels and sold six vessels from the previously stacked vessel fleet  resulting in a total of stacked sub saharan africa europe based vessels as of march  sub saharan africa europe based vessel operating profit decreased approximately  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  because of lower revenues  which were partially offset by  or million  lower vessel operating costs primarily lower repair and maintenance costs and other vessel costs which were partially offset by higher crew costs  insurance and loss reserves  and vessel operating lease costs during the comparative periods 
in addition  vessel operating profit decreased because of a  or million  increase in depreciation expense  during the same comparative periods  because of newly constructed and acquired vessels that were added to the sub saharan africa europe based fleet and because of the mobilization of vessels into this segment from other segments 
repair and maintenance costs decreased  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  due to a fewer number of drydockings being performed during the current fiscal year 
other vessel costs decreased  or million  during the same comparative periods  due to a million decrease in brokers commission resulting from weaker demand for the company s vessels in this segment and because the prior fiscal year included a million fine assessed by the angolan government for failure to remit taxes in a timely manner 
crew costs increased approximately  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to an increase in the number of deepwater vessels operating in the segment 
insurance and loss

the company performed a review of all its assets for asset impairment during fiscal the below table summarizes the combined fair value of the assets that incurred impairments along with the amount of impairment during the years ended march the impairment charges were recorded in gain on asset dispositions  net 
in thousands amount of impairment incurred combined fair value of assets incurring impairment vessel class revenue and statistics by segment vessel utilization is determined primarily by market conditions and to a lesser extent by drydocking requirements 
vessel day rates are determined by the demand created largely through the level of offshore exploration  field development and production spending by energy companies relative to the supply of offshore service vessels 
suitability of equipment and the degree of service provided may also influence vessel day rates 
vessel utilization rates are calculated by dividing the number of days a vessel works during a reporting period by the number of days the vessel is available to work in the reporting period 
as such  stacked vessels depressed utilization rates because stacked vessels are considered available to work  and as such  are included in the calculation of utilization rates 
average day rates are calculated by dividing the revenue a vessel earns during a reporting period by the number of days the vessel worked in the reporting period 
vessel utilization and average day rates are calculated on all vessels in service again which includes stacked vessels and vessels in drydock but do not include vessels withdrawn from service two vessels at march  or vessels owned by joint ventures vessels at march

availability of cash at march   the company had million in cash and cash equivalents  of which million was held by foreign subsidiaries 
the company currently intends that earnings by foreign subsidiaries will be indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdictions in order to fund strategic initiatives such as investment  expansion and acquisitions  fund working capital requirements and repay debt both third party and intercompany of its foreign subsidiaries in the normal course of business 
moreover  the company does not currently intend to repatriate earnings of foreign subsidiaries to the united states because cash generated from the company s domestic businesses and credit available under its domestic financing facilities  as well as  the repayment of intercompany liabilities from foreign subsidiaries  are currently sufficient and are expected to continue to be sufficient for the foreseeable future to fund the cash needs of its operations in the united states 
however  if  in the future  cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries are needed to fund the company s operations in the united states  the repatriation of such amounts to the united states could result in a significant

delays in the expected deliveries of any of these vessels could result in these penalties being imposed by our customers

the company generally requires shipyards to provide third party credit support in the event that vessels are not completed and delivered in accordance with the terms of the shipbuilding contracts 
that third party credit support typically guarantees the return of amounts paid by the company  and generally takes the form of refundment guarantees or standby letters of credit issued by major financial institutions located in the country of the shipyard 
while the company seeks to minimize its shipyard credit risk by requiring these instruments  the ultimate return of amounts paid by the company in the event of shipyard default is still subject to the creditworthiness of the shipyard and the provider of the credit support  as well as the company s ability to successfully pursue legal action to compel payment of these instruments 
when third party credit support is not available or cost effective  the company endeavors to limit its credit risk through cash deposits and through other contract terms with the shipyard and other counterparties 
currently the company is experiencing substantial delay with one fast  crew supply boat under construction in brazil that was originally scheduled to be delivered in september of on april   pursuant to the vessel construction contract  the company sent the subject shipyard a letter initiating arbitration in order to resolve disputes of such matters as the shipyard s failure to achieve payment milestones  its failure to follow the construction schedule  and its failure to timely deliver the vessel 
the company believes that the shipyard has suspended construction of the vessel 
the company continues to pursue that arbitration 
the company has third party credit support in the form of insurance coverage for of the progress payments made on this vessel  or all but approximately million of the carrying value of the accumulated costs through march  in march  the company terminated four psv construction projects in indonesia due to unjustified delays beyond the agreed delivery dates 
the vessels were originally scheduled to deliver between may and november  but had projected delivery dates ranging from august to december at the time the projects were terminated 
the company had refundment guarantees in place supporting the progress payments that were made on these vessels and received the full refund including interest 
during november and december of  the company canceled its purchase agreements with the same shipyard for two anchor handling towing supply vessels under construction in indonesia 
the cancellations  which were due to unjustified delays beyond the agreed delivery dates  were authorized under the purchase agreements 
no deposits or progress payments were involved in these two cancellations 
two vessels under construction at a domestic shipyard have fallen substantially behind schedule 
the shipyard recently notified the company that the shipyard should be entitled to a delay in the delivery date for both vessels and an increase in the contract price for the first vessel because the company was late in completing and providing the shipyard with the vessel s detailed design drawings 
the detailed design drawings were developed for the company by a third party designer 
while the company believes that other factors also contributed to the delay  negotiations with the shipyard are ongoing in an attempt to reach an amicable settlement of these issues 
these negotiations are at a preliminary stage

brazilian customs 
in april  two brazilian subsidiaries of tidewater were notified by the customs office in macae  brazil that they were jointly and severally being assessed fines of million brazilian reais approximately million as of march  
the assessment of these fines is for the alleged failure of these subsidiaries to obtain import licenses with respect to tidewater vessels that provided brazilian offshore vessel services to petrobras  the brazilian national oil company  over a three year period ending december after consultation with its brazilian tax advisors  tidewater and its brazilian subsidiaries believe that vessels that provide services under contract to the brazilian offshore oil and gas industry are deemed  under applicable law and regulations  to be temporarily imported into brazil  and thus exempt from the import license requirement 
the macae customs office has now  without a change in the underlying applicable law or regulations  taken the position that the temporary importation exemption is only available to new  and not used  goods imported into brazil and therefore it was improper for the company to deem its vessels as being temporarily imported 
the fines have been assessed based on this new interpretation of brazilian customs law taken by the macae customs office 
after consultation with its brazilian tax advisors  the company believes that the assessment is without legal justification and that the macae customs office has misinterpreted applicable brazilian law on duties and customs 
the company is vigorously contesting these fines which it has neither paid nor accrued for and  based on the advice of its brazilian counsel  believes that it has a high probability of success with respect to the overturn of the entire amount of the fines  either at the administrative appeal level or  if necessary  in brazilian courts 
in december  an administrative appeals board issued a decision that disallowed million brazilian reais approximately million as of march  of the total fines sought by the macae customs office 
the full decision is subject to further administrative appellate review  and the company understands that this further full review by a secondary appellate board is ongoing 
the company is contesting the decision with respect to the remaining million brazilian reais approximately million as of march  in fines 
the company believes that the ultimate resolution of this matter will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
potential for future brazilian state tax assessment 
the company is aware that a brazilian state in which the company has operations has notified two of the company s competitors that they are liable for unpaid taxes and penalties and interest thereon for failure to pay state import taxes with respect to vessels that such competitors operate within the coastal waters of such state pursuant to charter agreements 
the import tax being asserted is equal to a percentage which could be as high as for vessels entering that state s waters prior to december  and thereafter of the affected vessels declared values 
the company understands that the two companies involved are contesting the assessment through administrative proceedings before the taxing authority 
to date  the company s two brazilian subsidiaries  as well as vessels for all other competitors more than a hundred competitors  have not been similarly notified by the brazilian state that it has an import tax liability related to its vessel activities imported through that state 
although the company has been advised by its brazilian tax counsel that substantial defenses would be available if a similar tax claim were asserted against the company  if an import tax claim were to be asserted  it could be for a substantial amount given that the company has had substantial and continuing operations within the territory of the state although the amount could fluctuate significantly depending on the administrative determination of the taxing authority as to the rate to apply  the vessels subject to the levy and the time periods covered 
in addition  under certain circumstances  the company might be required to post a bond or other adequate security in the amount of the assessment plus any interest and penalties if it became necessary to challenge the assessment in a brazilian court 
the 
table of contents 
index to financial statements statute of limitations for the brazilian state to levy an assessment of the import tax is five years from the date of a vessel s entry into brazil 
the company has not yet determined the potential tax assessment  and according to the brazilian tax counsel  chances of defeating a possible claim notification from the state authorities in court are probable 
to obtain legal certainty and predictability for future charter agreements and because the company was importing two vessels to start new charters in brazil  the company filed two suits on august  and april   respectively  against the brazilian state and judicially deposited the respective state tax for these newly imported vessels 
as of march   no accrual has been recorded for any liability associated with any potential future assessment for previous periods based on management s assessment  after consultation with brazilian counsel  that a liability for such taxes was not probable

application of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures and disclosures of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
we evaluate the reasonableness of these estimates and assumptions continually based on a combination of historical experience and other assumptions and information that comes to its attention that may vary its outlook for the future 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects are subject to uncertainty  and accordingly  these estimates may change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as the business environment in which we operate changes 
as a result  actual results may differ from estimates under different assumptions 
we suggest that the company s nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies  as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report  be read in conjunction with this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we have defined a critical accounting estimate as one that is important to the portrayal of our financial condition or results of operations and requires us to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates about matters that are uncertain 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies that affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements are described below 
there are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimation and judgment but they are not deemed critical as defined above 
revenue recognition our primary source of revenue is derived from time charter contracts of its vessels on a rate per day of service basis  therefore  vessel revenues are recognized on a daily basis throughout the contract period 
these time charter contracts are generally either on a term basis average three months to two years or on a spot basis 
the base rate of hire for a term contract is generally a fixed rate  provided  however  that term contracts at times include escalation clauses to recover increases in specific costs 
a spot contract is a short term agreement to provide offshore marine services to a customer for a specific short term job 
spot contract terms generally range from one day to three months 
vessel revenues are recognized on a daily basis throughout the contract period 
there are no material differences in the costs structure of the company s contracts based on whether the contracts are spot or term  for the operating costs are generally the same without regard to the length of a contract 
receivables and allowance for doubtful accounts in the normal course of business  we extend credit to our customers on a short term basis 
our principal customers are major oil and natural gas exploration  field development and production companies 
we routinely review and evaluate our accounts receivable balances for collectability 
the determination of the collectability of amounts due from our customers requires us to use estimates and make judgments regarding future events and trends  including monitoring our customers payment history and current credit worthiness to determine that collectability is reasonably assured  as well as consideration of the overall business climate in which our customers operate 
provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded when it becomes evident that our customer will not make the required payments  which results in a reduction in our receivable balance 
we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover potential bad debt losses under current conditions  however  uncertainties regarding changes in the financial condition of our customers  either adverse or positive  could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for doubtful accounts that may be required 
during fiscal  we recorded a million provision to fully reserve accounts receivable payable by two of

the company tests goodwill for impairment annually at the reporting unit level using carrying amounts as of december or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired 
the company uses the two step method for evaluating goodwill for impairment as prescribed by financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  intangibles goodwill and other 
step one involves comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount 
the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is determined by discounting the projected future operating cash flows for the remaining average useful life of the assets within the reporting units by the company s estimated weighted average cost of capital 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  there is no impairment 
if the reporting unit s carrying amount is greater than the fair value  the second step must be completed to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
step two involves calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible assets  excluding goodwill  of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in step one 
the implied fair value of goodwill determined in this step is compared to the carrying value of goodwill 
impairment is deemed to exist if the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is less than the respective carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill  and in such case  an impairment loss would be recognized equal to the difference 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit  such as  future expected utilization and average day rates for the vessels  vessel additions and attrition  operating expenses and tax rates 
although the company believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable  deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result 
at march   the company s goodwill balance represented of total assets and of stockholders equity 
interim testing is performed if events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired 
examples of events or circumstances that might give rise to interim goodwill impairment testing include prolonged adverse industry or economic changes  significant business interruption due to political unrest or terrorism  unanticipated competition that has the potential to dramatically reduce the company s earning potential  legal issues  or the loss of key personnel 
impairment of long lived assets the company reviews the vessels in its active fleet for impairment whenever events occur or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable 
in such evaluation  the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated by an asset group are compared with the carrying amount of the asset group to determine if a write down may be required 
with respect to vessels that have not been stacked  we group together for impairment testing purposes vessels with similar operating and marketing characteristics 
we also subdivide our groupings of assets with similar operating and marketing characteristics between our older vessels and newer vessels 
the company estimates cash flows based upon historical data adjusted for the company s best estimate of expected future market performance  which  in turn  is based on industry trends 
if an asset group fails the undiscounted cash flow test  the company uses the discounted cash flow method to determine the estimated fair value of each asset group and compares such estimated fair value  considered level  as defined by asc  impairment or disposal of long lived assets  to the carrying value of each asset group in order to determine if impairment exists 
if impairment exists  the carrying value of the asset group is reduced to its estimated fair value 
the primary estimates and assumptions used in reviewing active vessel groups for impairment include utilization rates  average dayrates  and average daily operating expenses 
these estimates are made based on recent actual trends in utilization  dayrates and operating costs and reflect management s best estimate of expected market conditions during the period of future cash flows 
these assumptions and estimates have changed considerably as market conditions have changed and they are reasonably likely to continue to change as market conditions change in the future 
although the company believes its assumptions and estimates are 
table of contents 
index to financial statements reasonable  deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce materially different results 
management estimates may vary considerably from actual outcomes due to future adverse market conditions or poor operating results that could result in the inability to recover the current carrying value of an asset group  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
as the company s fleet continues to age  management closely monitors the estimates and assumptions used in the impairment analysis in order to properly identify evolving trends and changes in market conditions that could impact the results of the impairment evaluation 
in addition to the periodic review of its active long lived assets for impairment when circumstances warrant  the company also performs a review of its stacked vessels and vessels withdrawn from service every six months or whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a vessel may not be recoverable 
management estimates each stacked vessel s fair value by considering items such as the vessel s age  length of time stacked  likelihood of a return to active service  actual recent sales of similar vessels  among others 
in certain situations we obtain an estimate of the fair value of the stacked vessel from third party appraisers or brokers 
the company records an impairment charge when the carrying value of a vessel withdrawn from service or a stacked vessel exceeds its estimated fair value 
the estimates of fair value of stacked vessels are also subject to significant variability  are sensitive to changes in market conditions  and are reasonably likely to change in the future 
the company has consistently recorded modest gains on the sale of stacked vessels 
income taxes the liability method is used for determining the company s income tax provisions  under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates 
under this method  the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered 
in addition  the company determines its effective tax rate by estimating its permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
as a global company  we are subject to the jurisdiction of taxing authorities in the united states and by the respective tax agencies in the countries in which we operate internationally  as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments 
our operations in these different jurisdictions are taxed on various bases actual income before taxes  deemed profits which are generally determined using a percentage of revenue rather than profits and withholding taxes based on revenue 
determination of taxable income in any tax jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount  timing and character of deductions  permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits 
changes in tax laws  regulations  agreements and treaties  foreign currency exchange restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact on the amount of income taxes that we provide during any given year 
the company is periodically audited by various taxing authorities in the united states and by the respective tax agencies in the countries in which it operates internationally 
the tax audits generally include questions regarding the calculation of taxable income 
audit adjustments affecting permanent differences could have an impact on the company s effective tax rate 
the carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets is based on the company s present belief that it is more likely than not that it will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to utilize such deferred tax assets  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record or adjust valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assesses the need for changes to valuation allowances on a quarterly basis 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the present need for a valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made

index to financial statements drydocking costs the company expenses maintenance and repair costs as incurred during the asset s original estimated useful life its original depreciable life 
major repair costs incurred after the original depreciable life that also have the effect of extending the useful life of the asset are capitalized and amortized over months 
vessel modifications that are performed for a specific customer contract are capitalized and amortized over the firm contract term 
major vessel modifications are capitalized and amortized over the remaining life of the equipment 
the majority of the company s vessels require a drydocking inspection twice in every five year period  and the company schedules these drydockings when it is anticipated that the work can be performed 
while the actual length of time between drydockings can vary  we use a month amortization period for the costs of these drydockings as an average time between the required certifications 
the company s net earnings can fluctuate quarter to quarter due to the timing of scheduled drydockings 
accrued property and liability losses the company self insures a portion of potential hull damage and personal injury claims that may arise in the normal course of business 
we are exposed to insurance risks related to the company s reinsurance contracts with various insurance entities 
the reinsurance recoverable amount can vary depending on the size of a loss 
the exact amount of the reinsurance recoverable is not known until all losses are settled 
the company estimates the reinsurance recoverable amount we expect to receive and utilizes third party actuaries to estimate losses for claims that have occurred but have not been reported or not fully developed 
reinsurance recoverable balances are monitored regularly for possible reinsurance exposure and we record adequate provisions for doubtful reinsurance receivables 
it is the company s opinion that its accounts and reinsurance receivables have no impairment other than that for which provisions have been made 
pension and other postretirement benefits the company sponsors a defined benefit pension plan and a supplemental executive retirement plan covering eligible employees of tidewater inc and participating subsidiaries 
the accounting for these plans is subject to guidance regarding employers accounting for pensions and employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
net periodic pension costs and accumulated benefit obligations are determined using a number of assumptions  of which the discount rates used to measure future obligations  expenses and expected long term return on plan assets are most critical 
less critical assumptions  such as  the rate of compensation increases  retirement ages  mortality rates  health care cost trends  and other assumptions  also have a significant impact on the amounts reported 
the company s pension costs consists of service costs  interest costs  expected returns on plan assets  amortization of prior service costs or benefits and  in part  on a market related valuation of assets 
the company considers a number of factors in developing its pension assumptions  which are evaluated at least annually  including an evaluation of relevant discount rates  expected long term returns on plan assets  plan asset allocations  expected changes in wages and retirement benefits  analyses of current market conditions and input from actuaries and other consultants 
the company also sponsors a post retirement plan that provides limited health care and life insurance benefits to qualified retired employees 
costs of the program are based on actuarially determined amounts and are accrued over the period from the date of hire to the full eligibility date of employees who are expected to qualify for these benefits 
this plan is not funded 
new accounting pronouncements for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements  refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
effects of inflation day to day operating costs are generally affected by inflation 
because the energy services industry requires specialized goods and services  general economic inflationary trends may not affect the company s operating costs 
the major impact on operating costs is the level of offshore exploration  field development and production spending by energy exploration and production companies 
as spending increases  prices of goods and services used by the energy industry and the energy services industry will increase 
future increases in vessel day rates may shield the company from the inflationary effects on operating costs

index to financial statements the company s newer technologically sophisticated anchor handling towing supply vessels and platform supply vessels generally require a greater number of specially trained fleet personnel than the company s older  smaller vessels 
competition for skilled crews will likely intensify  particularly in international markets  as new build vessels currently under construction enter the global fleet 
concerns regarding shortages in skilled labor become an increasing concern globally  during calendar year  global wages in the energy industry have risen approximately per analyst reports 
increases in local wages is another developing trend regarding wage inflation  especially in south america where local wages have trended higher and are now on par or have exceeded wages earned by the expatriate employee work force 
if competition for personnel intensifies  the market for experienced crews could exert upward pressure on wages  which would likely increase the company s crew costs 
strong fundamentals in the global energy industry experienced in the past few years have also increased the activity levels at shipyards worldwide and  until the calendar year global recession  the price of steel had increased dramatically due to increased worldwide demand for the metal 
the price of steel continues to be high by historical standards 
although prices eased with the reduced global demand for steel in recent years  availability of iron ore  the main component of steel  is tighter today than in when prices for iron ore increased dramatically 
steel consumption increased during calendar year and into calendar but is expected to wane if the economic recovery loses momentum 
if the price of steel declines  the cost of new vessels will result in lower capital expenditures and depreciation expenses  which taken by themselves would increase our future operating profits 
environmental compliance during the ordinary course of business  the company s operations are subject to a wide variety of environmental laws and regulations that govern the discharge of oil and pollutants into navigable waters 
violations of these laws may result in civil and criminal penalties  fines  injunction and other sanctions 
compliance with the existing governmental regulations that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment has not had  nor is expected to have  a material effect on the company 
environmental laws and regulations are subject to change however  and may impose increasingly strict requirements and  as such  the company cannot estimate the ultimate cost of complying with such potential changes to environmental laws and regulations 
all vessels over feet in registered length  regardless of flag  that are operating as a means of transportation within the inland and offshore waters of the us but not beyond the three nautical mile territorial sea limit must comply with the environmental protection agency s national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes vessel general permit vgp for discharges incidental to the normal operation of vessels 
for our vessels  that includes ballast water  bilge water  graywater  cooling water  chain locker effluent  deck wash down and runoff  cathodic protection  and other such type runoff 
the company believes that it is in full compliance with the vgp 
the company is also involved in various legal proceedings that relate to asbestos and other environmental matters 
in the opinion of management  based on current information  the amount of ultimate liability  if any  with respect to these proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
the company is proactive in establishing policies and operating procedures for safeguarding the environment against any hazardous materials aboard its vessels and at shore based locations 
whenever possible  hazardous materials are maintained or transferred in confined areas in an attempt to ensure containment if accidents occur 
in addition  the company has established operating policies that are intended to increase awareness of actions that may harm the environment

the company periodically enters into spot and forward derivative financial instruments as a hedge against foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  currency commitments  or to lock in desired interest rates 
spot derivative financial instruments are short term in nature and settle within two business days 
the fair value of spot derivatives approximates the carrying value due to the short term nature of this instrument  and as a result  no gains or losses are recognized 
forward derivative financial instruments are generally longer term in nature but generally do not exceed one year 
the accounting for gains or losses on forward contracts is dependent on the nature of the risk being hedged and the effectiveness of the hedge

we generally do not hedge against any foreign currency rate fluctuations associated with foreign currency contracts that arise in the normal course of business  which exposes us to the risk of exchange rate losses 
to minimize the financial impact of these items the company attempts to contract a significant majority of its services in us dollars 
in addition  the company attempts to minimize its financial impact of these risks by matching the currency of the company s operating costs with the currency of the revenue streams when considered appropriate 
the company continually monitors the currency exchange risks associated with all contracts not denominated in us dollars
