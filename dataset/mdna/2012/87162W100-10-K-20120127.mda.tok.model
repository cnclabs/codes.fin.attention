overview we are a fortune corporation and a leading business process services company  servicing resellers  retailers and original equipment manufacturers  or oems  in multiple regions around the world 
our primary business process services are wholesale distribution and business process outsourcing  or bpo 
we operate in two segments distribution services and global business services  or gbs 
our distribution services segment provides value added services and distributes it systems  peripherals  system components  software  networking equipment  ce  and complementary products 
we also provide contract assembly services within our distribution segment 
our gbs segment offers a range of bpo services to customers that include technical support  renewals management  lead management  direct sales  customer service  back office processing and information technology outsourcing  or ito 
many of these services are delivered and supported on the proprietary software platforms we have developed to provide additional value to our customers 
we combine our core strengths in distribution with our bpo services to help our customers achieve greater efficiencies in time to market  cost minimization  real time linkages in the supply chain and after market product support 
we distribute more than  technology products as measured by skus from more than it and ce oem suppliers to more than  resellers  system integrators  and retailers throughout the united states  canada  japan and mexico 
as of november   we had over  full time and temporary employees worldwide 
from a geographic perspective  approximately of our total revenue was from north america for the fiscal year and for both of fiscal years and in our distribution segment  we purchase it systems  peripherals  system components  software  networking equipment  ce and complementary products from our primary suppliers such as hewlett packard company  or hp  microsoft  panasonic  lenovo and seagate and sell them to our reseller and retail customers 
we perform a similar function for our distribution of licensed software products 
our reseller customers include value added resellers  or vars  corporate resellers  government resellers  system integrators  direct marketers  and national and regional retailers 
in our broadline distribution business  we add value added service offerings in key vertical markets such as government and healthcare and we have specialized service 
table of contents offerings increasing efficiencies in areas like print management  renewals  networking and other services 
in our gbs segment  our customers are primarily manufacturers of it hardware and ce devices  developers of software  cloud service providers  and broadcast and social media 
revenue and cost of revenue we derive our revenue primarily through the distribution of it systems  peripherals  system components  software  networking equipment  ce  contract assembly services and bpo 
for products  we recognize revenue generally as products are shipped  if a purchase order exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured  risk of loss and title have transferred and product returns are reasonably estimable 
shipping terms are typically fob our warehouse 
provisions for sales returns are estimated based on historical data and are recorded concurrently with the recognition of revenue 
we review and adjust these provisions periodically 
revenue is reduced for early payment discounts and volume incentive rebates offered to customers 
we provide our bpo services in our gbs segment to customers under contracts that typically consist of a master services agreement or statement of work  which contains the terms and conditions of each program and service we offer 
our agreements are usually short term in nature  subject to early termination by our customers or us for any reason  typically with to days notice 
revenue is recognized as services are performed and if collection is reasonably assured 
none of our customers accounted for more than of our total revenue in fiscal years or in fiscal year  one customer accounted for of our total revenue 
approximately   and of our total revenue in fiscal years  and  respectively  was derived from the sale of hp products and services 
the market for it products and services is generally characterized by declining unit prices and short product life cycles 
our overall business is also highly competitive on the basis of price 
we set our sales price based on the market supply and demand characteristics for each particular product or bundle of products we distribute and services we provide 
from time to time  we also participate in the incentive and rebate programs of our oem suppliers 
these programs are important determinants of the final sales price we charge to our reseller customers 
to mitigate the risk of declining prices and obsolescence of our distribution inventory  our oem suppliers generally offer us limited price protection and return rights for products that are marked down or discontinued by them 
we carefully manage our inventory to maximize the benefit to us of these supplier provided protections 
in our distribution segment  we are highly dependent on the end market demand for it and ce products and services 
this end market demand is influenced by many factors including the introduction of new it and ce products and software by oems  replacement cycles for existing it and ce products  overall economic growth and general business activity 
a difficult and challenging economic environment may also lead to consolidation or decline in the it and ce industries and increased price based competition 
a significant portion of our cost of revenue is the purchase price we pay our oem suppliers for the products we sell  net of any rebates and purchase discounts received from our oem suppliers 
cost of product distribution revenue also consists of provisions for inventory losses and write downs  freight expenses associated with the receipt in and shipment out of our inventory  and royalties due to oem vendors 
in addition  cost of revenue includes the cost of materials  labor and overhead for our contract assembly and gbs services 
margins the distribution and contract assembly services industries in which we operate are characterized by low gross profit as a percentage of revenue  or gross margin  and low income from operations as a percentage of revenue  or operating margin 
our gross margin has fluctuated annually due to changes in the mix of products and services we offer  customers we sell to  incentives and rebates received from our oem suppliers  competition  seasonality and replacement of less profitable business with investments in higher margin  more profitable lines and lower costs associated with increased efficiencies 
increased competition arising from industry consolidation and low demand for it products may hinder our ability to maintain or improve our gross margin 
generally  when our revenue becomes more concentrated on limited products or customers  our gross margin tends to decrease due to increased pricing pressure from oem suppliers or reseller customers 
our operating margin from continuing operations has also fluctuated annually  based primarily on our ability to achieve economies of scale  the management of our operating expenses  changes in the relative mix of our distribution  contract assembly and bpo revenue  and the timing of our acquisitions and investments 
in addition  beginning in the first fiscal quarter of  we recognized revenue on certain service contracts  post contract software support services  and extended warranty contracts  where we are not a primary obligor  on a net basis  which favorably impacted our gross and operating margins 

table of contents economic and industry trends our revenue is highly dependent on the end market demand for it and ce products 
this end market demand is influenced by many factors including the introduction of new it and ce products and software by oems  replacement cycles for existing it and ce products and overall economic growth and general business activity 
a difficult and challenging economic environment may also lead to consolidation or decline in the it and ce distribution industry and increased price based competition 
the gbs industry is also extremely competitive 
the customers performance measures are based on competitive pricing terms and quality of services 
accordingly  we could be subject to pricing pressure and may experience a decline in our average selling prices for our services 
in fiscal year  the distribution market place experienced an economic recession which caused overall channel volumes to decline 
during fiscal year the economic environment was slow in recovering from the recession and the economy was stable and grew modestly during fiscal year while we are susceptible to economic trends in the global economy  our distribution business is largely concentrated in the united states  canada and japan  so we will be most directly impacted by economic strength or weakness in these geographies 
seasonality our operating results are affected by the seasonality of the it and ce products industries 
we have historically experienced higher sales in our fourth fiscal quarter due to patterns in the capital budgeting  federal government spending and purchasing cycles of our customers and end users 
these patterns may not be repeated in subsequent periods 
deferred compensation plan we have a deferred compensation plan for a limited number of our directors and employees 
we maintain a liability on our balance sheet for salary and bonus amounts deferred by participants and we accrue interest expense on uninvested amounts 
interest expense on the deferred amounts is classified in selling  general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of operations 
the participant may designate one or more investments as the measure of investment return on the participant s account 
the equity securities are either classified as trading securities or cost method securities 
generally  the gains losses on the deferred compensation securities are recorded in other income expense  net and an equal amount is charged or credited if losses to selling  general and administrative expenses relating to compensation amounts which are payable to the plan participants 
for the deferred compensation investments  we recorded a loss of million in fiscal year and a gain of million and million  in fiscal years and  respectively 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussions and analyses of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the financial statement date  and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we review and evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those that relate to accounts receivable  vendor programs  inventories  goodwill and intangible assets  and income taxes 
our estimates are based on our historical experience and a variety of other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making our judgment about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are affected by our judgment  estimates and or assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we generally recognize revenue on the sale of hardware and software products when they are shipped and on services when they are performed  if a purchase order exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collection of resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured  risk of loss and title have transferred and product returns are reasonably estimable 
provisions for sales returns are estimated based on historical data and are recorded concurrently with the recognition of revenue 
these provisions are reviewed and adjusted periodically by us 
revenue is reduced for early payment discounts and volume incentive rebates offered to customers 
we recognize revenue on certain service contracts  post contract software support services  and extended warranty contracts  where we are not the primary obligor  on a net basis 
we provide services such as call center  renewals  maintenance and contract management services to our customers under contracts that typically consist of a master services agreement or statement of work  which contains the terms and conditions of each program and service offerings 
typically the contracts are time based or transactions or volume based 
revenue is generally recognized over the term of the contract or when service has been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured 

table of contents effective in the first quarter of fiscal year  we began recognizing revenue on certain service contracts  post contract software support services  and extended warranty contracts  where we are not the primary obligor  on a net basis 
approximately of revenue was recorded on a net basis for fiscal years and our mexico operation primarily focuses on projects with the mexican government and other public agencies that are long term in nature 
under the agreements  we sell computers and equipment to contractors that provide services to the mexican government 
we also sell computers  equipment and services directly to the mexican government 
the payments are due on a monthly basis and contingent upon the satisfactory performance of certain services  fulfillment of certain obligations and meeting certain conditions 
we recognize revenue and cost of revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the contract  which coincides with payments no longer being contingent 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we provide allowances for doubtful accounts on our accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments for outstanding balances 
in estimating the required allowance  we take into consideration the overall quality and aging of the accounts receivable  credit evaluations of customers financial condition and existence of credit insurance 
we also evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable based on specific customer circumstances  current economic trends  historical experience with collections and value and adequacy of collateral received from customers 
oem supplier programs 
we receive funds from oem suppliers for inventory price protection  product rebates  marketing and infrastructure reimbursement  and promotion programs 
product rebates are recorded as a reduction of cost of revenue 
marketing  infrastructure and promotion programs are recorded  net of direct costs  in selling  general and administrative expenses 
any excess funds associated with these programs are recorded in cost of revenue 
we accrue rebates based on the terms of the program and sales of qualifying products 
some of these programs may extend over one or more quarterly reporting periods 
amounts received or receivable from oem suppliers that are not yet earned are deferred on our balance sheet 
actual rebates may vary based on volume or other sales achievement levels  which could result in an increase or reduction in the estimated amounts previously accrued 
in addition  oem suppliers may seek to change the terms of some or all of these programs or cease them altogether 
any such change could lower our gross margins on products we sell or revenue earned 
we also provide reserves for receivables on oem supplier programs for estimated losses resulting from oem suppliers inability to pay or rejections of such claims by oem suppliers 
inventories 
our inventory levels are based on our projections of future demand and market conditions 
any sudden decline in demand and or rapid product improvements and technological changes can cause us to have excess and or obsolete inventories 
on an ongoing basis  we review for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventories and write down our inventories to their estimated net realizable value based upon our forecasts of future demand and market conditions 
these write downs are reflected in our cost of revenue 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our forecasts  additional inventory reserves may be required 
our estimates are influenced by the following considerations sudden decline in demand due to economic downturns  rapid product improvements and technological changes  our ability to return to oem suppliers a certain percentage of our purchases  and protection from loss in value of inventory under our oem supplier agreements 
goodwill and intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired in an acquisition 
we assess potential impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets when there is evidence that recent events or changes in circumstances have made recovery of an asset s carrying value unlikely 
we also assess potential impairment of our goodwill on an annual basis during our fourth quarter  regardless if there is evidence or suspicion of impairment 
if indicators of impairment were present in intangible assets used in operations and future undiscounted cash flows were not expected to be sufficient to recover the assets carrying amount  an impairment loss would be charged to expense in the period identified 
the amount of an impairment loss would be recognized as the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value 
factors we consider important  which may cause impairment  include significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired asset  negative industry or economic trends  and significant underperformance relative to historical or projected operating results 
no impairment loss was recorded for the periods presented 
in accordance with accounting standards codification  intangible goodwill and other topic  a two step impairment test is required to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of the goodwill impairment loss to be recognized 
in the first step  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value to determine if the goodwill is impaired 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  then goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit were to exceed its fair value  then the second step is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and an impairment loss is recorded for an amount equal to the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the goodwill 
for the purpose of goodwill analysis  we have two reporting units our distribution services reporting unit and our gbs 
table of contents reporting unit 
we conducted our annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of fiscal year our goodwill impairment analysis did not result in any impairment charge for fiscal years  or determining the fair value of a reporting unit  intangible asset or a long lived asset is judgmental and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions that we believe are reasonable  but are uncertain and subject to changes in market conditions 
long lived assets 
we review the recoverability of our long lived assets  such as property and equipment  when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value of the asset group may not be recoverable 
the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group from the expected future pre tax cash flows  undiscounted and without interest charges  of the related operations 
if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such assets  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value 
income taxes 
we estimate our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
our current tax expense is estimated after adjusting for temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items and foreign tax credits 
these differences may result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets  which include net operating loss carry forwards and temporary differences that are expected to be deductible in future years  will be recoverable from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies 
if recovery is not likely  we provide a valuation allowance based on our estimates of future taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions  and the amount of deferred taxes in excess of amounts that are ultimately considered more likely than not realizable 
the provision for current and deferred taxes involves evaluations and judgments of uncertainties in the interpretation of complex tax regulations by various tax authorities 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
recent acquisitions and divestitures we seek to augment our services offering expansion with strategic acquisitions of businesses and assets that complement and expand our global bpo capabilities 
we also divest businesses that we deem no longer strategic to our ongoing operations 
our historical acquisitions have brought us new reseller and retail customers  oem suppliers  and product lines  have extended the geographic reach of our operations  particularly in targeted markets  and have diversified and expanded the services we provide to our oem suppliers and customers
