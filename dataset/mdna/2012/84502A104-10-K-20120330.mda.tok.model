overview the corporation is a full service community bank holding company headquartered in moultrie  georgia 
the community of moultrie has been served by the bank since we provide comprehensive financial services to consumer  business and governmental customers  which  in addition to conventional banking products  include a full range of mortgage banking  trust  investment and insurance services 
our primary market area incorporates colquitt county  where we are headquartered  and baker  lowndes  thomas  and worth counties  each contiguous with colquitt county  and the surrounding counties of southwest georgia 
we have five full service banking facilities and seven automated teller machines 
our strategy is to maintain the diversity of our revenue  including both interest and noninterest income through a broad base of business  strengthen our sales and marketing efforts while developing our employees to provide the best possible service to our customers  expand our market share where opportunity exists  and grow outside of our current geographic market either through de novo branching or acquisitions into areas proximate to our current market area 
we believe that investing in sales and marketing in this challenging market will provide us with a competitive advantage 
to that end  we expanded geographically with a full service banking center that was completed and opened in june of and a mortgage origination office that opened in january  both in valdosta  georgia 
continuing our expansion in the valdosta market  we have almost completed construction on our second banking center and we expect to have the branch open in the first quarter of the corporation s profitability  like most financial institutions  is dependent to a large extent upon net interest income  which is the difference between the interest received on earning assets and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the corporation s earning assets are primarily loans  securities  and short term interest bearing deposits with banks and the interest bearing liabilities are principally customer deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is highly sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates 
for example  after the overnight borrowing rate for banks reached in september of  the federal reserve bank began decreasing it by to a range of to 
this historically low interest rate level has remained unchanged for the period from october through december to address interest rate fluctuations  we manage our balance sheet in an effort to diminish the impact should interest rates suddenly change 
broadening our revenue sources helps to reduce the risk and exposure of our financial results to the impact of changes in interest rates  which are outside of our control 
sources of noninterest income include our insurance agency and empire  the corporation s commercial mortgage banking subsidiary  as well as fees on customer accounts  and trust and retail brokerage services 
in  noninterest income was more than of the corporation s total revenue  whereas in noninterest income accounted for of the corporation s total revenue 
our profitability is impacted also by operating expenses such as salaries  employee benefits  occupancy  and income taxes 
our lending activities are significantly influenced by regional and local factors such as changes in population  competition among lenders  interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates on competing uses of funds and investments  customer preferences and levels of personal income and savings in the corporation s primary market area 
the economic downturn continues to challenge our region  however  our strength and stability in the market and our focused efforts enabled us to achieve positive results in we continued to invest in our people and communities  fully aware of the near term impact that would have on earnings 
although the economy is slowly recovering  regulatory burdens continue to outpace growth opportunities 
despite those challenges  we will continue to focus on our customers and believe that our strategic positioning  strong balance sheet and capital levels position us to sustain our franchise  capture market share and build customer loyalty 
at the end of  the corporation s nonperforming assets increased slightly to million 
this increase is primarily due to a thousand increase in nonaccrual loans compared to the end of partially offsetting this increase  foreclosed assets decreased thousand 
critical accounting policies in the course of the corporation s normal business activity  management must select and apply many accounting policies and methodologies that lead to the financial results presented in the consolidated financial statements of the corporation 
management considers the accounting policy relating to the allowance for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy because of the uncertainty and subjectivity inherent in estimating the levels of allowance needed to cover probable credit losses within the loan portfolio and the material effect that these estimates have on the corporation s results of operations 
we believe that the allowance for loan losses as of december   is adequate  however  under adverse conditions or assumptions  future additions to the allowance may be necessary 
there have been no significant changes in the methods or assumptions used in our accounting policies that would have resulted in material estimates and assumptions changes 
note to the consolidated financial statements provides a description of our significant accounting policies and contributes to the understanding of how our financial performance is reported

uses and sources of funds the corporation  primarily through the bank  acts as a financial intermediary 
as such  our financial condition should be considered in terms of how we manage our sources and uses of funds 
our primary sources of funds are deposits and borrowings 
we invest our funds in assets  and our earning assets are what provide us income 
total average assets increased million to million in as compared with the increase in total average assets is primarily attributable to a higher level of average total loans of million and an increase in average total investment securities of million 
the corporation s earning assets  which include loans  investment securities  certificates of deposit with other banks and interest bearing deposits with banks  averaged million in  a increase from million in while the year end balance for interest bearing deposits with banks was more than the previous year  the average volume decreased million compared with the prior year 
for  average earning assets were comprised of loans  investment securities  and deposit balances with banks 
the ratio of average earning assets to average total assets increased slightly to for compared with for loans loans are one of the corporation s largest earning assets and uses of funds 
because of the importance of loans  most of the other assets and liabilities are managed to accommodate the needs of the loan portfolio

the loan portfolio also included other commercial  financial  and agricultural purposes of and installment loans to individuals for consumer purposes of 
allowance and provision for possible loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of the amount required for probable loan losses in the corporation s loan portfolio 
loans  or portions thereof  which are considered to be uncollectible are charged against this allowance and any subsequent recoveries are credited to the allowance 
there can be no assurance that the corporation will not sustain losses in future periods which could be substantial in relation to the size of the allowance for loan losses at december  we have a loan review program in place which provides for the regular examination and evaluation of the risk elements within the loan portfolio 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is regularly evaluated based on the review of all significant loans with particular emphasis on nonaccruing  past due  and other potentially impaired loans that have been identified as possible problems 
the allowance for loan losses was million  or of total loans outstanding  as of december  this level represented a thousand increase from the corresponding year end amount which was of total loans outstanding 
we increased the allowance for loan losses in response to the market and economic environment 
there was a provision for loan losses of thousand in compared with a provision for loan losses of thousand in see part i  item  table loan portfolio of the guide for details of the changes in the allowance for loan losses 
investment securities the investment portfolio serves several important functions for the corporation 
investments in securities are used as a source of income to complement loan demand and to satisfy pledging requirements in the most profitable way possible 
the investment portfolio is a source of liquidity when loan demand exceeds funding availability  and is a vehicle for adjusting balance sheet sensitivity to cushion against adverse rate movements 
our investment policy attempts to provide adequate liquidity by maintaining a portfolio with significant cash flow for reinvestment 
the corporation s investment securities represent of our assets and consist largely of us government sponsored pass thru residential mortgage backed securities 
also  the portfolio includes state  county and municipal securities 
the following table summarizes the contractual maturity of investment securities at their carrying values as of december  amounts maturing in securities available for sale securities held to maturity total dollars in thousands one year or less    after one through five years    after five through ten years    after ten years    equity securities total investment securities    at year end  the total investment portfolio decreased to million  a decrease of million  or  compared with million at year end the majority of this decrease was due to calls and maturities of million of us government agencies and municipals as well as residential mortgage backed securities principal paydowns of approximately million 
additionally  we sold million of longer term residential mortgage backed securities and million of us government treasuries 
these sales resulted in a net gain of thousand 
offsetting these calls  maturities  and sales  we purchased million of us government agencies  us government sponsored residential mortgage backed securities  and municipal securities 
the average investment portfolio increased million to million in from million in we will continue to actively manage the size  components  and maturity structure of the investment securities portfolio 
future investment strategies will continue to be based on profit objectives  economic conditions  interest rate risk objectives  and balance sheet liquidity demands 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets are defined as nonaccrual loans  loans that are days past due and still accruing  other than temporarily impaired preferred stock  and property acquired by foreclosure 
the level of nonperforming assets increased thousand at year end compared with year end this increase was primarily due to a larger amount of nonaccrual loans 
nonaccrual loans increased due to additional loans becoming past due compared with the previous year 
partially offsetting the increase in nonaccrual loans  foreclosed assets decreased thousand 
nonperforming assets were approximately million  or of total assets as of december   compared with million  or of total assets at year end deposits and other interest bearing liabilities our primary source of funds is deposits 
the corporation offers a variety of deposit accounts having a wide range of interest rates and terms 
we rely primarily on competitive pricing policies and customer service to attract and retain these deposits 
in  average deposits increased compared with  from million to million 
this average deposit growth occurred primarily in noninterest bearing deposits 
as of december   the corporation s certificates of deposit of  or more increased slightly to million from million at the end of we have used borrowings from the federal home loan bank to support our residential mortgage lending activities 
during  the corporation repaid million of the fixed rate advances from the federal home loan bank 
during  we expect to pay million of the fixed rate advances 
total long term advances with the federal home loan bank were million at december  two of these advances totaling million have convertible options by the issuer to convert the rates to a month libor 
the corporation intends to pay off these advances at the conversion dates 
details on the federal home loan bank advances are presented in notes and to the financial statements 
liquidity liquidity is managed to assume that the corporation can meet the cash flow requirements of customers who may be either depositors wanting to withdraw their funds or borrowers needing funds to meet their credit needs 
many factors affect the ability to accomplish liquidity objectives successfully 
those factors include the economic environment  our asset liability mix and our overall reputation and credit standing in the marketplace 
in the ordinary course of business  our cash flows are generated from deposits  interest and fee income  loan repayments and the maturity or sale of other earning assets 
the consolidated statement of cash flows details the corporation s cash flows from operating  investing  and financing activities 
during  operating and financing activities provided cash flows of million  while investing activities used million resulting in an increase in cash and cash equivalents balances of million 
liability liquidity represents our ability to renew or replace our short term borrowings and deposits as they mature or are withdrawn 
the corporation s deposit mix includes a significant amount of core deposits 
core deposits are defined as total deposits less time deposits of  or more 
these funds are relatively stable because they are generally accounts of individual customers who are concerned not only with rates paid  but with the value of the services they receive  such as efficient operations performed by helpful personnel 
total core deposits were of total deposits on december   compared with in asset liquidity is provided through ordinary business activity  such as cash received from interest and fee payments as well as from maturing loans and investments 
additional sources include marketable securities and short term investments that are easily converted into cash without significant loss 
the corporation had million investment securities maturing within one year or less on december   which represented of the investment debt securities portfolio 
also  the corporation has approximately thousand of state and municipal securities callable at the option of the issuer within one year and approximately million of expected annual cash flow in principal reductions from payments of mortgage backed securities 
due to the current interest rate environment  million of our callable securities were called in and million were called in we have reinvested these proceeds from called investment securities in new loans and new investment securities 
we are not aware of any other known trends  events  or uncertainties that will have or that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the corporation s liquidity or operations 
contractual obligations the chart below shows the corporation s contractual obligations and its scheduled future cash payments under those obligations as of december the majority of the corporation s outstanding contractual obligations are long term debt 
the remaining contractual obligations are comprised of purchase obligations for data processing services and a rental agreement for our mortgage servicing office 
we have no capital lease obligations 
payments due by period contractual obligations dollars in thousands total less than year years years after years long term debt    operating leases total contractual obligations   off balance sheet arrangements we are a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk which arise in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit in the form of loans or through letters of credit 
the instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the financial statements 
since many of the commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the contractual amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk dollars in thousands commitments to extend credit   standby letters of credit the corporation does not have any special purpose entities or off balance sheet financing payment obligations 
capital resources and dividends our average equity to average assets ratio was in and in the federal reserve board and the fdic have issued rules regarding risk based capital requirements for us banks and bank holding companies 
overall  these guidelines define the components of capital  require higher levels of capital for higher risk assets and lower levels of capital for lower risk assets  and include certain off balance sheet items in the calculation of capital requirements 
the risk based capital regulations require banks to maintain an total risk based ratio  of which must consist primarily of tangible common stockholders equity tier i capital or its equivalent 
also  the regulations require a financial institution to maintain a leverage ratio 
at year end  we were well in excess of the minimum requirements under the guidelines with a total risk based capital ratio of  a tier i risk based capital ratio of  and a leverage ratio of 
to continue to conduct its business as currently conducted  the corporation and the bank will need to maintain capital well above the minimum levels 
the following table presents the risk based capital and leverage ratios for year end and in comparison to both the minimum regulatory guidelines and the minimum for well capitalized risk based capital ratios dec

 minimum regulatory guidelines minimum for well capitalized tier i capital total risk based capital leverage interest rate sensitivity the corporation s most important element of asset liability management is the monitoring of its sensitivity and exposure to interest rate movements which is the corporation s primary market risk 
we have no foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk  or any other material market risk 
the corporation has no trading investment portfolio  nor do we have any interest rate swaps or other derivative instruments 
our primary source of earnings  net interest income  can fluctuate with significant interest rate movements 
to lessen the impact of these movements  we seek to maximize net interest income while remaining within prudent ranges of risk by practicing sound interest rate sensitivity management 
we attempt to accomplish this objective by structuring the balance sheet so that the differences in repricing opportunities between assets and liabilities are minimized 
interest rate sensitivity refers to the responsiveness of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to changes in market interest rates 
the corporation s interest rate risk management is carried out by the asset liability management committee which operates under policies and guidelines established by the bank 
the principal objective of asset liability management is to manage the levels of interest sensitive assets and liabilities to minimize net interest income fluctuations in times of fluctuating market interest rates 
to effectively measure and manage interest rate risk  the corporation uses computer simulations that determine the impact on net interest income of numerous interest rate scenarios  balance sheet trends and strategies 
these simulations cover the following financial instruments short term financial instruments  investment securities  loans  deposits  and borrowings 
these simulations incorporate assumptions about balance sheet dynamics  such as loan and deposit growth and pricing  changes in funding mix  and asset and liability repricing and maturity characteristics 
simulations are run under various interest rate scenarios to determine the impact on net income and capital 
from these computer simulations  interest rate risk is quantified and appropriate strategies are developed and implemented 
the corporation also maintains an investment portfolio which receives monthly cash flows from mortgage backed securities principal payments  and staggered maturities and provides flexibility over time in managing exposure to changes in interest rates 
any imbalances in the repricing opportunities at any point in time constitute a financial institution s interest rate sensitivity
