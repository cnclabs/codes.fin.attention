item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements including the notes thereto in item of this report 
we provide contract drilling services to the energy industry around the globe and are a leader in offshore drilling 
our fleet of offshore drilling rigs consists of semisubmersibles  jack ups and four dynamically positioned drillships  three of which are under construction with delivery expected in the second and fourth quarters of and in the second quarter of in addition  in january  we announced the construction of a moored semisubmersible rig that will be designed to operate in water depths up to  feet 
the rig  to be named the ocean onyx  will be constructed utilizing the hull of one of our mid water floaters that previously operated as the ocean voyager 
of our fleet  eight rigs are currently cold stacked  consisting of three intermediate semisubmersibles one in the us gulf of mexico  or gom  and two in malaysia and five jack up rigs four in the gom and one in malaysia 
overview international floater market our floating rigs accounted for approximately of our contract drilling revenue during the as of the date of this report  industry wide floater utilization is reported to be greater than  and  as of february   our floating rigs were committed for approximately of the days remaining in and of internationally  the ultra deepwater and deepwater floater markets are generally strong and also show signs of further strengthening  particularly in the ultra deepwater segment where we believe that there are few uncontracted rigs available to work in however  based on a december analyst report  there are ultra deepwater and deepwater floaters under construction  which are expected to enter the market in and many of these floaters  primarily those scheduled for delivery in  are not yet contracted for future work 
market strength for ultra deepwater and deepwater rigs varies among geographic regions 
upcoming drilling programs offshore brazil will require a number of additional ultra deepwater rigs 
this demand may be met by rigs contructed domestically in brazil  including deepwater floaters ordered by petrobras 
however  additional demand for ultra deepwater rigs could develop if brazilian drilling programs  including those of petrobras  are accelerated prior to delivery of domestically constructed rigs 
in addition  successful exploration and development programs in west africa have given rise to a robust market for deepwater and ultra deepwater rigs in that region 
market strength for mid water floaters is stable or improving depending on the geographic market 
in the north sea  the mid water market is strong  with signs of increasing dayrates  and  in the mediterranean region  demand remains solid 
the southeast asia and australia markets also remain steady 
worldwide jack up market four of our marketed jack up rigs are currently operating in the mexican waters of the gulf of mexico  where drilling activity remains stable and additional tendering activity is ongoing 
of our two remaining marketed international jack ups  one is currently working in egypt  and the other  located in montenegro  is actively seeking work 
gom floater and jack up market deepwater drilling activity in the gom  while strengthening  continues to be impacted by the issuance of oil and gas drilling permits for operations on the ocs  which has not yet returned to pre macondo levels 
in addition  since the macondo well blowout in more stringent and encompassing rules for oil and gas operations on the ocs have been implemented 
as of the date of this report  we have two actively marketed rigs in the gom  consisting of one semisubmersible and one jack up rig 
the ocean victory and ocean columbia are currently operating in the gom  both with contract backlog extending into the second quarter of the construction of our deepwater  moored semisubmersible rig  the ocean onyx  is taking place in a shipyard in brownsville  texas 

table of contents contract drilling backlog the following table reflects our contract drilling backlog as of february   october  the date reported in our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended september  and february  the date reported in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  
contract drilling backlog is calculated by multiplying the contracted operating dayrate by the firm contract period and adding one half of any potential rig performance bonuses 
our calculation also assumes full utilization of our drilling equipment for the contract period excluding scheduled shipyard and survey days  however  the amount of actual revenue earned and the actual periods during which revenues are earned will be different than the amounts and periods shown in the tables below due to various factors 
utilization rates  which generally approach during contracted periods  can be adversely impacted by downtime due to various operating factors including  but not limited to  weather conditions and unscheduled repairs and maintenance 
contract drilling backlog excludes revenues for mobilization  demobilization  contract preparation and customer reimbursables 
no revenue is generally earned during periods of downtime for regulatory surveys 
changes in our contract drilling backlog between periods are a function of the performance of work on term contracts  as well as the extension or modification of existing term contracts and the execution of additional contracts 
february  october  february  in thousands contract drilling backlog floaters ultra deepwater deepwater mid water total floaters jack ups total contract drilling backlog as of february  for our ultra deepwater floaters includes i billion attributable to our contracted operations offshore brazil for the years to and ii billion attributable to future work for two of our drillships under construction

contract drilling backlog as of february  for our deepwater floaters includes i million  million and million for the years to  respectively  and million in the aggregate for the years to  attributable to our contracted operations offshore brazil 

table of contents contract drilling backlog as of february  for our mid water floaters includes i million  million  million and million for the years to  respectively  attributable to our contracted operations offshore brazil 
the following table reflects the percentage of rig days committed by year as of february  the percentage of rig days committed is calculated as the ratio of total days committed under contracts  as well as scheduled shipyard  survey and mobilization days for all rigs in our fleet  to total available days number of rigs multiplied by the number of days in a particular year 
total available days have been calculated based on the expected final commissioning dates for the ocean blackhawk  ocean blackhornet  ocean blackrhino and the ocean onyx  which are all under construction 
for the years ending december  rig days committed floaters ultra deepwater deepwater mid water all floaters jack ups as of february   includes approximately  and currently known  scheduled shipyard  survey and mobilization days for and  respectively 
general the two most significant variables affecting our revenues are dayrates for rigs and rig utilization rates  each of which is a function of rig supply and demand in the marketplace 
demand for drilling services is dependent upon the level of expenditures set by oil and gas companies for offshore exploration and development  as well as a variety of political  regulatory and economic factors 
the availability of rigs in a particular geographical region also affects both dayrates and utilization rates 
these factors are not within our control and are difficult to predict 
demand affects the number of days our fleet is utilized and the dayrates earned 
as utilization rates increase  dayrates tend to increase as well  reflecting the lower supply of available rigs 
conversely  as utilization rates decrease  dayrates tend to decrease as well  reflecting the excess supply of rigs 
when a rig is idle  no dayrate is earned and revenues will decrease as a result 
revenues can also be affected as a result of the acquisition or disposal of rigs  required surveys and shipyard upgrades 
in order to improve utilization or realize higher dayrates  we may mobilize our rigs from one market to another 
however  during periods of mobilization  revenues may be adversely affected 
as a response to changes in demand  we may withdraw a rig from the market by stacking it or may reactivate a rig stacked previously  which may decrease or increase revenues  respectively 
we recognize revenue from dayrate drilling contracts as services are performed 
in connection with such drilling contracts  we may receive fees either lump sum or dayrate for the mobilization of equipment 
we earn these fees as services are performed over the initial term of the related drilling contracts 
we defer mobilization fees received  as well as direct and incremental mobilization costs incurred  and amortize each  on a straight line basis  over the term of the related drilling contracts which is the period we estimate to be benefited from the mobilization activity 
straight line amortization of mobilization revenues and related costs over the term of the related drilling contracts which generally range from two to months is consistent with the timing of net cash flows generated from the actual drilling services performed 
absent a contract  mobilization costs are recognized currently 
from time to time  we may receive fees from our customers for capital improvements to our rigs either lump sum or dayrate 
we defer such fees and recognize them into income on a straight line basis over the period of the related drilling contract as a component of contract drilling revenue 
we capitalize the costs of such capital improvements and depreciate them over the estimated useful life of the improvement 

table of contents as a result of anticipated downtime in the current year for rig mobilizations  regulatory surveys and shipyard projects  we expect contract drilling revenue in to decline from the levels attained in we also expect contract drilling revenue for some of our rigs to be lower as these rigs fulfill term commitments under contracts at lower dayrates than previously earned in and may not be able to benefit from higher dayrates that the market is currently bearing 
see risk factors the terms of our drilling contracts may limit our ability to attain profitability in a declining market or to benefit from increasing dayrates in an improving market in item a of this report 
we receive reimbursements for the purchase of supplies  equipment  personnel services and other services provided at the request of our customers in accordance with a contract or agreement 
we record these reimbursements at the gross amount billed to the customer as revenues related to reimbursable expenses in our consolidated statements of operations included in item of this report 
operating income 
our operating income is primarily affected by revenue factors  but is also a function of varying levels of operating expenses 
our operating expenses represent all direct and indirect costs associated with the operation and maintenance of our drilling equipment 
the principal components of our operating costs are  among other things  direct and indirect costs of labor and benefits  repairs and maintenance  freight  regulatory inspections  boat and helicopter rentals and insurance 
labor and repair and maintenance costs represent the most significant components of our operating expenses 
in general  our labor costs increase primarily due to higher salary levels  rig staffing requirements and costs associated with labor regulations in the geographic regions in which our rigs operate 
in addition  the costs associated with training new and seasoned employees can be significant 
we expect our labor and training costs to increase in as a result of increased hiring and training activities as we continue the process of crewing three new drillships 
costs to repair and maintain our equipment fluctuate depending upon the type of activity the drilling unit is performing  as well as the age and condition of the equipment and the regions in which our rigs are working 
our operating costs are also impacted by the regulatory environments in which we operate 
the adoption of new regulations could result in additional inspection and certification costs  as well as require additional capital investment to comply with regulatory requirements 
accordingly  we cannot fully predict the financial impact of any new regulations that may arise relating to drilling activities in the gom  or elsewhere in the world 
new laws or regulations may require an increase in our capital spending for additional equipment to comply with such requirements 
our business could be negatively impacted by additional downtime which may be required to obtain necessary equipment and to install such equipment or to obtain the required inspections or certifications as prescribed under such regulations 
operating expenses generally are not affected by changes in dayrates  and short term reductions in utilization do not necessarily result in lower operating expenses 
for instance  if a rig is to be idle for a short period of time  few decreases in operating expenses may actually occur since the rig is typically maintained in a prepared or warm stacked state with a full crew 
in addition  when a rig is idle  we are responsible for certain operating expenses such as rig fuel and supply boat costs  which are typically costs of the operator when a rig is under contract 
however  if the rig is to be idle for an extended period of time  we may reduce the size of a rig s crew and take steps to cold stack the rig  which lowers expenses and partially offsets the impact on operating income 
we recognize  as incurred  operating expenses related to activities such as inspections  painting projects and routine overhauls that meet certain criteria and which maintain rather than upgrade our rigs 
these expenses vary from period to period 
costs of rig enhancements are capitalized and depreciated over the expected useful lives of the enhancements 
higher depreciation expense decreases operating income in periods following capital upgrades 
our operating income is negatively impacted when we perform certain regulatory inspections  which we refer to as a year survey  or special survey  that are due every five years for each of our rigs 
operating revenue decreases because these special surveys are performed during scheduled downtime in a shipyard 
operating expenses increase as a result of these special surveys due to the cost to mobilize the rigs to a shipyard  inspection costs incurred and repair and maintenance costs 
repair and maintenance activities may result from the special survey or may have been previously planned to take place during this mandatory downtime 
the number of rigs undergoing a year survey will vary from year to year  as well as from quarter to quarter 
in addition  operating income may be negatively impacted by intermediate surveys  which are performed at interim periods between year surveys 
intermediate surveys are generally less extensive in duration and scope than a year survey 
although an intermediate survey may require some downtime for the drilling rig  it normally does not require dry docking or shipyard time  except for rigs located in the uk and norwegian sectors of the north sea 

table of contents during  of our rigs will require year surveys and one of our uk rigs will require dry docking for inspections 
we expect these rigs to be out of service for approximately days in the aggregate 
we also expect to spend an additional approximately days during for intermediate surveys  the mobilization of rigs  contract acceptance testing and extended maintenance projects 
we can provide no assurance as to the exact timing and or duration of downtime associated with regulatory inspections  planned rig mobilizations and other shipyard projects 
see overview contract drilling backlog 
we are self insured for physical damage to rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the us gulf of mexico 
if a named windstorm in the us gulf of mexico causes significant damage to our rigs or equipment  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
under our insurance policy that expires on may   we carry physical damage insurance for certain losses other than those caused by named windstorms in the us gulf of mexico for which our deductible for physical damage is million per occurrence 
we do not typically retain loss of hire insurance policies to cover our rigs 
in addition  under our insurance policy that expires on may   we carry marine liability insurance covering certain legal liabilities  including coverage for certain personal injury claims  with no exclusions for pollution and or environmental risk 
we believe that the policy limit for our marine liability insurance is within the range that is customary for companies of our size in the offshore drilling industry and is appropriate for our business 
our deductibles for marine liability coverage  including for personal injury claims  are million for the first occurrence and vary in amounts ranging between million and  if aggregate claims exceed certain thresholds  up to million for each subsequent occurrence  depending on the nature  severity and frequency of claims which might arise during the policy year  which under the current policy commences on may of each year 
construction and capital upgrade projects 
we capitalize interest cost for the construction and upgrade of qualifying assets in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  or gaap 
the period of interest capitalization covers the duration of the activities required to make the asset ready for its intended use  and the capitalization period ends when the asset is substantially complete and ready for its intended use 
for the year ended december   we capitalized interest of million on qualifying expenditures related to the construction of our three new drillships  beginning in august in addition  during  we also expect to capitalize interest related to the construction of the ocean onyx 
critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are included in note general information to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
judgments  assumptions and estimates by our management are inherent in the preparation of our financial statements and the application of our significant accounting policies 
we believe that our most critical accounting estimates are as follows property  plant and equipment 
we carry our drilling and other property and equipment at cost 
maintenance and routine repairs are charged to income currently while replacements and betterments  which upgrade or increase the functionality of our existing equipment and that significantly extend the useful life of an existing asset  are capitalized 
significant judgments  assumptions and estimates may be required in determining whether or not such replacements and betterments meet the criteria for capitalization and in determining useful lives and salvage values of such assets 
changes in these judgments  assumptions and estimates could produce results that differ from those reported 
historically  the amount of capital additions requiring significant judgments  assumptions or estimates has not been significant 
during the years ended december  and  we capitalized million and million  respectively  in replacements and betterments of our drilling fleet  resulting from numerous projects ranging from  to million per project 
we evaluate our property and equipment for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable such as cold stacking a rig or excess spending over budget on a newbuild  construction project or major rig upgrade 
we utilize a probability weighted cash flow analysis in testing an asset for potential impairment 
our assumptions and estimates underlying this analysis include the following dayrate by rig  utilization rate by rig expressed as the actual percentage of time per year that the rig would be used  the per day operating cost for each rig if active  warm stacked or cold stacked  the estimated annual cost for rig replacements and or enhancement programs  
table of contents the estimated maintenance  inspection or other costs associated with a rig returning to work  salvage value for each rig  and estimated proceeds that may be received on disposition of the rig 
based on these assumptions and estimates  we develop a matrix using several different utilization dayrate scenarios  to each of which we have assigned a probability of occurrence 
the sum of our utilization scenarios which include active  warm stacked and cold stacked and probability of occurrence scenarios both equal in the aggregate 
we reevaluate our cold stacked rigs annually  and we update the matrices for each of our cold stacked rigs at each year end and modify our assumptions giving consideration to the length of time the rig has been cold stacked  the current and expected market for the type of rig and expectations of future oil and gas prices 
further  to test sensitivity  we consider the impact of a reduction in assumed dayrates for the cold stacked rigs holding all other assumptions and estimates in the model constant 
we would not necessarily record an impairment if the sensitivity analysis indicated potential cash flows would be insufficient to recover our carrying value 
we would assess other qualitative factors including industry  regulatory and other relevant conditions to determine whether an impairment or further disclosure is warranted 
a summary of our cold stacked rigs evaluated for impairment at december   and was as follows december  in millions  except number of rigs mid water semisubmersibles jack ups total aggregate net book value we performed an impairment review for each of these rigs using the methodology described above 
based on our analyses  we concluded that these eight  seven and four rigs were not subject to impairment at december   and  respectively 
management s assumptions are an inherent part of our asset impairment evaluation and the use of different assumptions could produce results that differ from those reported 
personal injury claims 
our deductibles for liability coverage for personal injury claims  which primarily result from jones act liability in the gulf of mexico  is million per the first occurrence  with no aggregate deductible  and vary in amounts ranging between million and  if aggregate claims exceed certain thresholds  up to million for each subsequent occurrence  depending on the nature  severity and frequency of claims which might arise during the policy year 
the jones act is a federal law that permits seamen to seek compensation for certain injuries during the course of their employment on a vessel and governs the liability of vessel operators and marine employers for the work related injury or death of an employee 
we engage outside consultants to assist us in estimating our aggregate liability for personal injury claims based on our historical losses and utilizing various actuarial models 
the models used in estimating our aggregate reserve for personal injury claims include actuarial assumptions such as claim emergence  or the delay between occurrence and recording of claims  settlement patterns  or the rates at which claims are closed  development patterns  or the rate at which known cases develop to their ultimate level  average  potential frequency and severity of claims  and effect of re opened claims 

table of contents the eventual settlement or adjudication of these claims could differ materially from our estimated amounts due to uncertainties such as the severity of personal injuries claimed  significant changes in the volume of personal injury claims  the unpredictability of legal jurisdictions where the claims will ultimately be litigated  inconsistent court decisions  and the risks and lack of predictability inherent in personal injury litigation 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with accounting standards that require the recognition of the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and an asset and liability approach in recognizing the amount of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been currently recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
in each of our tax jurisdictions we recognize a current tax liability or asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year and a deferred tax asset or liability for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance  if necessary  which is determined by the amount of any tax benefits that  based on available evidence  are not expected to be realized under a more likely than not approach 
we do not establish deferred tax liabilities for certain of our foreign earnings that we intend to indefinitely reinvest to finance foreign activities 
however  if these earnings become subject to us federal tax  any required provision could have a material impact on our financial results 
we make judgments regarding future events and related estimates especially as they pertain to the forecasting of our effective tax rate  the potential realization of deferred tax assets such as utilization of foreign tax credits  and exposure to the disallowance of items deducted on tax returns upon audit 
certain of our international rigs are owned and operated  directly or indirectly  by diamond offshore international limited  or doil  a cayman islands subsidiary which we wholly own 
it is our intention to indefinitely reinvest future earnings of doil and its foreign subsidiaries to finance foreign activities 
accordingly  we have not made a provision for us income taxes on approximately billion of undistributed foreign earnings and profits 
although we do not intend to repatriate the earnings of doil and have not provided us income taxes for such earnings  except to the extent that such earnings were immediately subject to us income taxes  these earnings could become subject to us income tax if remitted  or if deemed remitted as a dividend  however  it is not practicable to estimate this potential liability 
in several of the international locations in which we operate  certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries enter into agreements with other of our wholly owned subsidiaries to provide specialized services and equipment in support of our foreign operations 
we apply a transfer pricing methodology to determine the amount to be charged for providing the services and equipment  and utilize outside consultants to assist us in the development of such transfer pricing methodologies 
in most cases  there are alternative transfer pricing methodologies that could be applied to these transactions and  if applied  could result in different chargeable amounts 
we record interest related to accrued unrecognized tax positions in interest expense and recognize penalties associated with uncertain tax positions in our tax expense 

table of contents results of operations although we perform contract drilling services with different types of drilling rigs and in many geographic locations  there is a similarity of economic characteristics among all our divisions and locations  including the nature of services provided and the type of customers for our services 
we believe that the combination of our drilling rigs into one reportable segment is the appropriate aggregation in accordance with applicable accounting standards on segment reporting 
however  for purposes of this discussion and analysis of our results of operations  we provide greater detail with respect to the types of rigs in our fleet to enhance the reader s understanding of our financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations

total operating income in decreased million  or  compared to  despite a million  or  increase in total contract drilling revenue during revenue generated by our floater rigs increased an aggregate million  or  in compared to  while revenue generated by our jack up fleet declined million or 
except for our deepwater floaters  average daily revenue earned by our other rigs during compared unfavorably to the levels attained in utilization for our ultra deepwater and deepwater floaters increased significantly in compared to  however  utilization for our mid water floater and jack ups fleets decreased in one additional mid water floater and one jack up rig were cold stacked during our two newest floaters  the ocean courage and ocean valor  which began operating under contract late in the first quarter and in the fourth quarter of  respectively  contributed incremental revenue of million during 
table of contents total contract drilling expense increased million  or  during compared to  reflecting incremental contract drilling expense for the ocean courage and ocean valor  higher amortized mobilization costs and higher other operating costs associated with rigs operating internationally rather than domestically 
other significant factors that affected the comparability of our operating income for the years ended december  and were as follows bad debt recovery expense 
during  we recorded a million provision for bad debts to reserve a portion of the uncollected balance of receivables related to our operations in egypt and recovered million in previously recorded reserves for bad debts 
during  we recovered million and million related to previously established reserves for bad debts related to our operations in egypt and the uk  respectively 
gain on disposition of assets 
during  we recognized an aggregate million gain on the disposition of assets  primarily related to the sale of used equipment  compared to an aggregate million net gain recognized in the prior year 
during  we sold the ocean shield for net proceeds of million and recognized a net gain on sale of million 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased million in compared to  primarily due to million of interest capitalized in on our three drillships under construction 
in addition  during  we recorded million of interest expense related to uncertain tax positions compared to million during income tax expense 
our effective tax rate for was  compared to a effective tax rate for the lower effective tax rate in the current year is primarily the result of differences in the mix of our domestic and international pre tax earnings and losses  as well as the mix of international tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
as our rigs frequently operate in different tax jurisdictions as they move from contract to contract  our effective tax rate can fluctuate substantially and our historical effective tax rates may not be sustainable and could increase materially 
also contributing to our lower effective tax rate in  compared to the prior year  was the impact of a tax law provision that expired at the end of but was subsequently signed back into law in december this provision allows us to defer recognition of certain foreign earnings for us tax purposes 
the extension of this tax law provision  and our decisions to build three new drillships overseas  caused us to reassess our intent to repatriate certain foreign earnings to the us we now plan to reinvest these earnings internationally  and consequently  we are no longer providing us income taxes on these earnings 
during the year ended december   we reversed the million of us income taxes that had been provided in for these earnings 
on december   the statute of limitations relative to a uncertain tax position in brazil expired 
as a consequence  in we reversed million of previously accrued interest expense and million of previously accrued tax expense  million of which had been accrued for penalties 
during  we accrued approximately million of expense for uncertain tax positions  primarily in mexico and brazil  of which million was interest and million was penalty related 
compared to operating income 
operating income in decreased million  or  compared to our operating results were negatively impacted by a decline in average daily revenue earned by our rigs in from the levels attained in while our contracted revenue backlog enabled us to partially mitigate the impact of the weakened market conditions at the time  our total contract drilling revenue decreased million  or  compared to revenue generated by our floater fleet decreased an aggregate million  or  and revenue for our jack up fleet decreased million  or  during compared to the previous year 
during  we cold stacked three additional rigs in the gom  consisting of two mid water floaters that returned from mexico during the year and one jack up rig 
however  the ocean courage and ocean valor  which commenced drilling operations during  contributed million to our revenue during total contract drilling expense increased million  or  in compared to  and included normal operating costs for the ocean courage and ocean valor  as well as increased amortized mobilization costs and higher other operating costs associated with rigs operating internationally rather than domestically 

table of contents other significant factors that affected the comparability of our operating income for the years ended december  and were as follows bad debt expense 
during  we recovered million in previously established reserves for bad debts related to our operations in egypt and the uk during  we recorded a million provision for bad debts to reserve a portion of the uncollected balance of receivables related to our operations in egypt and recovered million related to a previously established reserve for bad debt recorded in related to our operations in the uk depreciation expense 
depreciation expense increased million  or  during compared to  primarily due to depreciation associated with capital additions in and  and included depreciation expense for the ocean courage and ocean valor  which were placed in service in september and march  respectively 
gain on disposition of assets 
net gain on disposition of assets in was primarily related to the sale of the ocean shield 
net gain on disposition of assets in included a million gain on the sale of the ocean tower  which was damaged during a hurricane in interest expense 
interest expense increased million in compared to  primarily due to a full year of interest expense in for our senior notes due  or senior notes  and our senior notes due  or senior notes  issued in may and october  respectively million 
in addition  during  we recorded million in interest expense related to uncertain tax positions compared to a million net reduction  during  of accrued interest expense related to an uncertain tax position for which the statute of limitations had expired 
foreign currency transaction gain loss 
during  we recognized net foreign currency exchange gains of million  which included million in realized and unrealized gains on foreign currency forward exchange  or forex  contracts million in net unrealized gains from mark to market accounting and million in net realized losses on settled forex contracts not designated as accounting hedges 
during  we designated all of our forex contracts as accounting hedges and  as such  gains and losses on the settlement of these hedged contracts were recorded as a component of operating expenses under contract drilling  excluding depreciation 
income tax expense 
our income tax expense is a function of the mix between our domestic and international pre tax earnings or losses  as well as the mix of international tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
we recognized million of tax expense on pre tax income of billion for the year ended december  compared to tax expense of million on pre tax income of billion in the effective annual tax rate of in compared unfavorably to the effective annual tax rate of in primarily due to higher taxes for income tax contingencies  as well as taxes associated with the sale of the ocean shield 
during  we accrued approximately million of expense for uncertain tax positions  primarily in mexico and brazil  of which million was interest and million was penalty related 
on march   the statute of limitations relative to a uncertain tax position in mexico expired 
as a consequence  we reversed million of previously accrued interest expense and million of previously accrued tax expense  million of which had been accrued for penalties 

table of contents contract drilling revenue and expense by equipment type compared to ultra deepwater floaters 
revenue generated by our ultra deepwater floaters increased million during compared to our newest rigs  the ocean courage and ocean valor  were under contract in brazil for all of and worked a combined incremental revenue earning days  compared to  generating million in incremental revenue 
however  aggregate revenue earned by our six other ultra deepwater rigs decreased million in compared to  due to a reduction in average daily revenue earned million  partially offset by an increase in revenue earning days million due to the absence of downtime in associated with the relocation of the ocean endeavor  ocean confidence and ocean baroness from the gom to international locations in the previous year 
in addition  revenue was unfavorably impacted by the absence of a million contract termination fee earned by the ocean endeavor in july  partially offset by higher recognition of mobilization revenue during million 
contract drilling expense for our ultra deepwater floaters increased million in compared to  and included million in incremental contract drilling expense from the operation of the ocean courage and ocean valor  million in incremental mobilization expenses  and higher overall contract drilling expenses for the remainder of our fleet  including personnel related  maintenance and hull insurance costs  as well as higher costs associated with operating rigs internationally  such as freight  non income based taxes  revenue based agency fees and shorebase support costs 
deepwater floaters 
revenue generated by our deepwater floaters increased million in compared to  primarily due to additional revenue earning days million and an increase in average daily revenue earned million

however  aggregate revenue earned by our other six ultra deepwater rigs decreased million in compared to  due to fewer revenue earning days million  largely resulting from effects of the april  macondo well blowout in the gom  as well as a decrease in average daily revenue earned million 
the decline in revenue was partially offset by the recognition of million in incremental mobilization revenue  compared to the prior year  and the receipt of a million contract termination fee from a previous customer of the ocean endeavor in july the decrease in revenue earning days in was primarily attributable to increased downtime associated with incremental mobilization  contract preparation and customer acceptance days for three of our ultra deepwater rigs that were relocated from the gom to international locations in and unplanned downtime due to a force majeure assertion by one of our customers in the gom following the macondo incident 
contract drilling expense for our ultra deepwater floaters increased million in compared to  and included million in incremental contract drilling expense incurred by the ocean courage and ocean valor  as well as million in incremental mobilization expenses 
contract drilling expense in also reflected higher maintenance  inspection  freight  non income based taxes and other revenue based fees  partially offset by lower personnel and related costs  including a lower us labor component as more of our rigs worked internationally in compared to the prior year

revenue generated by our deepwater floaters increased million in compared to  primarily due to additional revenue earning days million 
the increase in revenue earning days in  compared to the prior year  resulted from fewer warm stacked days between contracts  partially offset by additional non revenue earning days due to scheduled shipyard time for inspections  repairs and contract preparation activities and incremental rig mobilization days

table of contents sources of liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flows from our operations and our cash reserves 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in marketable securities  representing our investment of cash available for current operations 
we terminated our million credit facility on october   prior to its contractual maturity on november  liquidity and capital requirements our liquidity and capital requirements are primarily a function of our working capital needs  capital expenditures and debt service requirements 
we determine the amount of cash required to meet our capital commitments by evaluating the need to upgrade rigs to meet specific customer requirements  our ongoing rig equipment replacement and enhancement programs  and our obligations relating to the construction of our three new drillships 
as a result of our intention to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of doil to finance our foreign activities  we do not expect such earnings to be available for distribution to our stockholders or to finance our domestic activities 
see overview critical accounting estimates income taxes 
however  we believe that the operating cash flows generated by and cash reserves of doil  and the operating cash flows available to and cash reserves of diamond offshore drilling  inc will be sufficient to meet their respective working capital requirements and capital commitments over the next twelve months 
we will  however  continue to make periodic assessments based on industry conditions and will adjust capital spending programs if required 
in addition  we may  from time to time  issue debt or equity securities  or a combination thereof  to finance capital expenditures  the acquisition of assets and businesses or for general corporate purposes 
our ability to access the capital markets by issuing debt or equity securities will be dependent on our results of operations  our current financial condition  current market conditions and other factors beyond our control

some of our subsidiaries conduct a portion of their operations in the local currency of the country where they conduct operations 
currency environments in which we have significant business operations include brazil  the uk  australia and mexico

our measure of market risk exposure represents an estimate of the change in fair value of our financial instruments 
market risk exposure is presented for each class of financial instrument held by us at december  and  assuming immediate adverse market movements of the magnitude described below 
we believe that the various rates of adverse market movements represent a measure of exposure to loss under hypothetically assumed adverse conditions 
the estimated market risk exposure represents the hypothetical loss to future earnings and does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected actual loss  even under adverse conditions  because actual adverse fluctuations would likely differ 
in addition  since our investment portfolio is subject to change based on our portfolio management strategy as well as in response to changes in the market  these estimates are not necessarily indicative of the actual results that may occur 
exposure to market risk is managed and monitored by our senior management 
senior management approves the overall investment strategy that we employ and has responsibility to ensure that the investment positions are consistent with that strategy and the level of risk acceptable to us 
we may manage risk by buying or selling instruments or entering into offsetting positions 
interest rate risk we have exposure to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates 
our investments in marketable securities are primarily in fixed maturity securities 
we monitor our sensitivity to interest rate risk by evaluating the change in the value of our financial assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates 
the evaluation is performed by applying an instantaneous change in interest rates by varying magnitudes on a static balance sheet to determine the effect such a change in rates would have on the recorded market value of our investments and the resulting effect on stockholders equity 
the analysis presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices which we believe are reasonably possible over a one year period 

table of contents the sensitivity analysis estimates the change in the market value of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities that were held on december  and  due to instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve of basis points  with all other variables held constant 
the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
accordingly  the analysis may not be indicative of  is not intended to provide  and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our earnings or stockholders equity 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions we could undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
our long term debt  as of december  and  is denominated in us dollars 
our existing debt has been issued at fixed rates  and as such  interest expense would not be impacted by interest rate shifts 
the impact of a basis point increase in interest rates on fixed rate debt would result in a decrease in market value of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
a basis point decrease would result in an increase in market value of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
foreign exchange risk foreign exchange rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in foreign currency exchange rates will impact the value of financial instruments 
it is customary for us to enter into forex contracts in the normal course of business 
these contracts generally require us to net settle the spread between the contracted foreign currency exchange rate and the spot rate on the contract settlement date  which for most of our contracts is the average spot rate for the contract period 
as of december   we had forex contracts outstanding in the aggregate notional amount of million  consisting of million in australian dollars  million in brazilian reais  million in british pounds sterling  million in mexican pesos and million in norwegian kroner 
these contracts generally settle monthly through june at december   we have presented the fair value of our outstanding forex contracts as a current asset of million in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a current liability of million in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets included in item of this report
