table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

some of the statements in the following discussion are forward looking statements 
see risk factors and cautionary note regarding forward looking statements 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is designed to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results 
our md a is presented in seven sections overview critical accounting estimates results of operations liquidity and capital resources impact of inflation contractual obligations off balance sheet items overview we are a specialty retailer of home appliances  televisions  computers  consumer electronics  mattresses and related services operating under the name hhgregg 
as of march   we operated stores in alabama  delaware  florida  georgia  illinois  indiana  kentucky  maryland  mississippi  new jersey  north carolina  ohio  pennsylvania  south carolina  tennessee and virginia 
hhgregg  inc was formed in delaware on april  as part of a corporate reorganization effected on july   the stockholders of gregg appliances contributed all of their shares of gregg appliances to hhgregg in exchange for common stock of hhgregg 
as a result  gregg appliances became a wholly owned subsidiary of hhgregg 
this overview section is divided into four sub sections discussing our operating strategy and performance  store development strategy  business strategy and core philosophies and seasonality 
operating strategy and performance 
we focus the majority of our floor space  advertising expense and distribution infrastructure on the marketing  delivery and installation of a wide selection of premium video and appliance products 
we display approximately models of flat panel televisions and major appliances in our stores with an especially broad assortment of models in the middle to upper end of product price ranges 
video and appliance net sales comprised and of our net sales mix in fiscal and  respectively 
we strive to differentiate ourselves through our customer purchase experience starting with a highly trained  consultative commissioned sales force which educates our customers on the features and benefits of our products  followed by rapid product delivery and installation  and ending with helpful post sales support services 
we carefully monitor our competition to ensure that our prices are competitive in the market place 
our experience has been that informed customers often choose to buy a more heavily featured product once they understand the applicability and benefits of its features 
heavily featured products typically carry higher average selling prices and higher margins than less featured  entry level price point products 

table of contents during fiscal  we implemented several initiatives designed to better position our business to drive additional traffic and increase sales in our comparable store base 
the first initiative was to grow our appliance market share 
we restructured our in store management team to include an appliance sales manager and a dedicated consumer electronics manager in lieu of a sales manager and an operations manager 
the appliance manager focuses on the appliance and bedding categories  increasing management focus and ensuring a superior customer purchase experience 
we expect to continue our increased marketing efforts in the appliance category with more appliance specific marketing messaging 
our second initiative was the development of our computing and mobile phones category 
this category previously included computers and tablets  and was expanded to include mobile phones in the second quarter of fiscal the development of our mobile phone business included the integration of all of the verizon cellular connection kiosks located within each of our stores into our internal operations 
the transition took place on august  in addition to mobile phones  we have expanded and will continue to expand our assortment of computers  tablets  peripherals and computer service offerings 
our third initiative for fiscal was the launch of our redesigned website 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we launched our new website which offers an updated look and feel  in addition to significant functionality enhancements 
this increased functionality includes options to buy our products online and pick up in store and the ability to ship products bought online directly to consumers from store locations 
our new website design provides an enhanced purchase experience for our online customers and enhances our multi channel retail strategy 
we also launched a new advertising campaign  we help  which focuses on our commitment to educating consumers and helping them to complete their purchase experience with the right product at a great price 
this campaign seeks to increase brand awareness among consumers and set us apart from our competitors 
the following table summarizes certain operating data that we believe are important to an understanding of our operating model fiscal year ended march  inventory turnover x x x working capital as a percentage of net sales net capital expenditures as a percentage of net sales income from operations as a percentage of net sales inventory turnover for the specified period is calculated by dividing our cost of goods sold for the fiscal year by the average of the beginning and ending inventory for that period 
working capital represents current assets excluding customer deposits and the current portion of deferred income taxes less current liabilities as of the end of the respective fiscal year end  expressed as a percentage of net sales 
net capital expenditures represent capital expenditures less proceeds and deposits from sale and leaseback transactions  expressed as a percentage of net sales 
for the fiscal year ended march   income from operations includes million of life insurance proceeds 
we focus on leveraging our semi fixed expenditures in advertising  distribution and regional management through closely managing our inventory  working capital and store development expenditures 
our inventory has averaged turns per year over the past three fiscal years 
our working capital  expressed as a percentage of net sales  has averaged over the past three fiscal years 
our net capital expenditures  measured as a percentage of net sales  have averaged over the past three fiscal years 

table of contents store development strategy 
over the past several years  we have adhered closely to a development strategy of adding stores to metropolitan markets in clusters to achieve rapid market share penetration and more efficiently leverage our distribution network  advertising and regional management costs 
our expansion plans include looking for new markets where we believe there is significant underlying demand for stores  typically in areas that demonstrate above average economic growth  strong household incomes and growth in new housing starts and or remodeling activity 
our markets typically include most or all of our major competitors 
we plan to continue to follow our approach of building store density in each major market and distribution area  which in the past has helped us to improve our market share and realize operating efficiencies 
during fiscal  we opened a net total of stores all of which were opened in new markets 
the new markets included chicago  illinois  miami  florida and pittsburgh  pennsylvania 
during the past months  we also opened a new regional distribution center in aurora  illinois and a new local distribution center in pembroke park  florida to support our growth plans 
our intention is to open between and new stores during fiscal the majority of these store openings are expected to be in new markets  including st 
louis  missouri  milwaukee  wisconsin and other locations in illinois 
business strategy and core philosophies 
our business strategy is focused around offering our customers a superior customer purchase experience 
from the time the customers walk in the door  they will experience a well designed  customer friendly store 
our stores are brightly lit and have clearly distinguished departments that allow our customers to find what they are looking for 
we greet and assist our customers with our highly trained consultative sales force  who are there to educate customers about different product features 
our products are rich in features and innovations and are ever changing 
we believe that customers find it helpful to have someone explain the features and benefits of our products 
we believe this assistance gives our customers the opportunity to buy the product that most closely matches their needs 
we follow up on the customer purchase experience by offering next day delivery on many of our products and high quality  in home installation service 
while many of our product offerings are considered essential items by our customers  other products and certain features are viewed as discretionary purchases 
as a result  our results of operations are susceptible to a challenging macro economic environment 
factors such as changes in consumer confidence  unemployment  consumer credit availability and the condition of the housing market have negatively impacted our core product categories and added volatility to our overall business 
as consumers show a more cautious approach to purchases of discretionary items  customer traffic and spending patterns continue to be difficult to predict 
the consumer electronics industry depends on new products to drive sales and profitability 
innovative  heavily featured products are typically introduced at relatively high price points 
over time  price points are gradually reduced to drive consumption 
accordingly  there has been price compression in flat panel televisions for equivalent screen sizes over the past few years 
according to the npd group  the prices of flat panel televisions in the industry have fallen more than since january as with similar product life cycles for console televisions  dvd players and large screen projection televisions  we have responded to this risk by shifting our sales mix to focus on newer  higher margin televisions that feature iptv technology  with an increased focus on selection and larger screen sizes 
in addition to declining average selling prices  promotional activity within the video category has resulted in a reduction in the gross profit margin rate for the category 
management expects the year over year gross profit rate pressure to continue through the first half of fiscal in addition to our shift in television sales mix  we have also added an increased selection of computers and tablets to our product assortment  and placed a focus on the development of our computing and mobile phones category 
however  lower than expected demand and pricing pressures could result in price points for heavily featured items declining more quickly  and to a greater extent  than we have historically experienced 
in addition to declining average selling prices  promotional activity within the consumer electronics industry could result in a reduction in the gross profit margin rate for these product categories 

table of contents retail appliance sales are highly correlated to the housing industry and housing turnover 
as more people purchase existing homes in the market  appliance sales tend to trend upward 
conversely  when demand in the housing market declines  appliance sales traffic is also negatively impacted 
the appliance industry has benefited greatly from increased innovation in energy efficient products 
while these energy efficient products typically carry a higher average selling price than traditional products  they save the consumer significant dollars in annual energy savings 
average unit selling prices of major appliances are not expected to change dramatically in the foreseeable future 
seasonality 
we experience seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating results due in part to seasonal shopping patterns 
for example  in fiscal and  we generated and  respectively  of our net sales in the fiscal quarter ended december  which includes the holiday selling season 
we also incur significant additional costs and expenses during the fiscal quarter ended december due to increased staffing levels and higher purchase volumes 
appliance revenue is impacted by seasonal weather patterns but is less seasonal than our electronics business and helps to offset the seasonality of our overall business 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events  and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and the related disclosures 
we base our assumptions  estimates and judgments on historical experience  current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared 
on a regular basis  management reviews the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with us gaap 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material
