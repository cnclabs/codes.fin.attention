item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the information set forth below should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements  and the notes thereto  and other financial information included herein 
overview our vision is to transform the lives of cancer patients with breakthrough medicines 
our mission is to discover  develop and commercialize small molecule drugs to treat cancer in patients with the greatest and most urgent unmet medical need aggressive cancers where current therapies are inadequate 
our goal is to build a fully integrated oncology company focused on novel  molecularly targeted therapies to treat solid tumors and hematologic cancers 
financial condition and results of operations at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  working capital of million  and total stockholders equity of million compared to cash and cash equivalents of million  working capital of million  and total stockholders equity of million at december  for the year ended december   we reported a net loss of million and cash used in operating activities of million 
based on our current operating plan  we believe that our cash and cash equivalents at december   together with the proceeds of warrant exercises received to date in  will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least two years 
product development and discovery our pipeline currently contains three product candidates ponatinib  ap and ridaforolimus 
ponatinib  previously known as ap  is an investigational pan bcr abl inhibitor that we believe has potential applications in various hematological cancers and solid tumors 
in the third quarter of  we completed patient enrollment in a pivotal phase clinical trial of ponatinib in patients with resistant or intolerant chronic myeloid leukemia  or cml  or philadelphia positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia  or ph all 
subject to further patient follow up and data analysis in this trial  we expect to file for marketing approval of ponatinib in the united states and europe in the third quarter of with potential regulatory approval in the united states as soon as the first quarter of subject to obtaining marketing approval  we intend to commercialize ponatinib in the united states and europe and other select markets worldwide 
we also plan to initiate additional clinical trials of ponatinib  including a phase clinical trial in newly diagnosed cml patients  and commence clinical trials of ponatinib in japan  in the second half of ap is an investigational dual inhibitor of anaplastic lymphoma kinase  or alk  and epidermal growth factor receptor  or egfr two clinically validated targets in non small cell lung cancer  or nsclc 
we initiated patient enrollment in a phase clinical trial of ap in the third quarter of we expect to enroll approximately to patients in this portion of the trial 
the phase portion of the trial is expected to begin in the second half of and is planned to enroll approximately additional patients 
depending on the results of this trial  we could to conduct a potential pivotal trial of ap in patients with nsclc commencing in ridaforolimus is an investigational mtor inhibitor that we discovered internally and later licensed in to merck 
under the license agreement  merck is responsible for all activities and has agreed to fund percent of the costs related to the development  manufacturing and commercialization of ridaforolimus in oncology 
we intend to co promote ridaforolimus in the united states  if approved 
in the third quarter of  merck filed in both europe and the united states for regulatory approval of ridaforolimus in patients with metastatic soft tissue and bone sarcomas who had a favorable response to chemotherapy 
under the license agreement  merck has agreed to pay us milestone payments based on successful development of ridaforolimus and achievement of specified sales thresholds  as well as tiered  double digit royalties on global net sales 
in addition to our lead development programs  we have a focused drug discovery program centered on small molecule therapies that are molecularly targeted to cell signaling pathways implicated in cancer 
our collaboration and license agreements with merck in july  we entered into a global collaboration agreement  or the collaboration agreement  with merck  under which we shared responsibility for the development  manufacturing and commercialization of ridaforolimus for use in cancer 
the collaboration agreement as in effect until may  provided that each party would fund percent of global development costs incurred 
under the terms of the collaboration agreement  merck paid us an initial up front payment of million in july and milestone payments of million through may  based on the achievement of specified clinical and regulatory events 
in may  we entered into an amended and restated agreement with merck  referred to as the license agreement  which replaced the collaboration agreement 
under the terms of the license agreement  we granted merck an exclusive license to develop  manufacture and commercialize ridaforolimus in oncology  and merck assumed responsibility for all activities related to the development  manufacture and commercialization of ridaforolimus and funds percent of all ridaforolimus costs incurred after january  the license agreement provides that all ridaforolimus activities that had been our responsibility under the collaboration agreement would be transitioned to merck  a process that was completed in the fourth quarter of the license agreement provides that merck will develop ridaforolimus in multiple oncology indications 
if ridaforolimus receives regulatory approval  merck will be responsible for selling ridaforolimus worldwide  will record global sales and will pay us tiered double digit royalties on global net sales 
the license agreement provided us with an option to co promote ridaforolimus for all indications in the united states and  in such case  we would be compensated by merck for our sales efforts 
we have elected to exercise our option to co promote ridaforolimus for the sarcoma indication  subject to the terms of a co promotion agreement being negotiated by us and merck 
under the license agreement  merck paid us an initial up front fee of million in the second quarter of and has agreed to pay us up to million in potential regulatory and sales milestone payments  based on the successful development of ridaforolimus in multiple potential cancer indications or upon achievement of specified product sales thresholds 
through december   merck has paid us a million milestone payment  in the third quarter of  for acceptance of the marketing authorization application in europe for the sarcoma indication 
potential additional milestone payments include up to million associated with potential regulatory approvals for the sarcoma indication consisting of million for marketing approval in the united states  million for approval to sell ridaforolimus in the european union  including first pricing and reimbursement approval granted by a regulatory authority in any major european country or by the ema  and million for marketing approval of ridaforolimus in japan  up to million associated with potential regulatory filings and approvals for other cancer indications  and up to million associated with the achievement of certain sales thresholds 
in accordance with our revenue recognition policy  upon execution of the license agreement  all previously deferred revenue from the collaboration agreement was recognized as revenue in the three month period ended june   which in combination with million of payments received from merck pursuant to the license agreement  was the primary contributor to our license and collaboration revenue of million and our net income of million for the year ended december critical accounting policies and estimates our financial position and results of operations are affected by subjective and complex judgments  particularly in the areas of revenue recognition  the carrying value of intangible assets  accrued product development expenses and the fair value of warrants to purchase our common stock 
revenue recognition we generate revenue from license and collaboration agreements with third parties related to use of our technology and or development and commercialization of product candidates 
such agreements may provide for payment to us of up front payments  periodic license payments  milestone payments and royalties 
we also generated revenue from services provided under license agreements 
for the year ended december   we reported total revenue of million 
revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
effective january   we adopted the guidance for accounting for multiple element revenue arrangements included in accounting standards update no 
the adoption had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
revenue arrangements with multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and is based on the selling price of the deliverables 
when deliverables are separable  consideration received is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on the relative selling price of the elements and the appropriate revenue recognition principles are applied to each unit 
the assessment of multiple element arrangements requires judgment in order to determine the appropriate units of accounting and the points in time that  or periods over which  revenue should be recognized 
regarding our collaboration agreement with merck for the development  manufacturing and commercialization of ridaforolimus  in effect from july to may  we determined the license and development deliverables constituted one unit of accounting and  therefore  the up front and milestone payments were deferred and recognized over the performance period 
regarding our license agreement with merck entered into in may that replaced the collaboration agreement  we determined that the license and the transition services were separate units of accounting  and because the fair value of the undelivered transition services was known  the amounts received related to the license and transition services are recognized in the period in which they are received or the services are rendered 
milestone payments under the license agreement are recognized when earned 
in the year ended december   the company received and recorded as revenue a million milestone payment 
intangible assets at december   we reported million of intangible assets  consisting of capitalized costs related primarily to purchased and issued patents  patent applications and licenses and the recorded value of the technology associated with our acquisition in september of the percent minority interest of ariad gene therapeutics  inc that we did not previously own  net of accumulated amortization 
the carrying value of these intangible assets is evaluated for possible impairment  and losses are recorded when the evaluation indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable 
this evaluation involves estimates of future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
such estimates require judgment regarding future events and expected cash flows 
changes in these estimates  including decisions to discontinue using the technologies  could result in material changes to our balance sheet and charges to our statements of operations 
if we were to abandon the ongoing development of the underlying product candidates or technologies or terminate our efforts to pursue collaborations or license agreements  we may be required to write down or write off a portion of the carrying value of our intangible assets 
in  we recorded charges of million in our statement of operations related to the discontinuation of efforts to pursue our nf b technology and to the assessment of the recoverability of our argent technology and certain other technologies 
accrued product development expenses we accrue expenses for our product development activities based on our estimates of services performed or progress achieved pursuant to contracts and agreements with multiple vendors including research laboratories  contract manufacturers  contract research organizations and clinical sites 
these estimates are recorded in research and development expenses in our statement of operations and are reflected in accrued product development expenses on our balance sheet 
at december   we reported accrued product development expenses of million on our balance sheet 
our estimates of services performed or progress achieved are based on all available information we have from reports  correspondence and discussions with our vendors 
our estimates of accrued expenses based on such information require judgment 
actual costs may vary from such estimates 
when such variances become known  we adjust our expenses accordingly 
fair value of warrants warrants outstanding at december  to purchase  shares of our common stock  issued on february  in connection with a registered direct offering of our common stock  are classified as a derivative liability 
accordingly  the fair value of the warrants is recorded on our balance sheet as a liability  and such fair value is adjusted at each financial reporting date with the adjustment to fair value reflected in our consolidated statement of operations 
at december   we reported a warrant liability of million on our balance sheet 
during the year ended december   a total of  warrants were exercised for proceeds to us of approximately million 
upon exercise of the warrants  the warrant liability is reduced by the portion of the warrant liability applicable to the exercised warrants  and stockholders equity is increased by this same amount plus the proceeds from the exercise 
all of the warrants that were outstanding on december  were exercised in january and february for proceeds to us of approximately million 
upon the exercise of these remaining warrants  the balance of the warrant liability was credited to stockholders equity and the liability was eliminated 
the fair value of the warrants is determined using the black scholes option valuation model 
fluctuations in the assumptions and factors used in the black scholes model would result in adjustments to the fair value of the warrants recorded on our balance sheet reflected through charges or credits in our statement of operations 
the primary factor in the black scholes model that impacts the fair value of the warrants is the market value of our common stock on the date of the valuation 
if the market value of our common stock on december  were percent higher or lower than used in the valuation of such warrants  our valuation of the warrants would have increased or decreased by million with such difference reflected in our statement of operations 
because the current market price of our common stock is significantly in excess of the exercise price of the warrants  other assumptions do not have a significant impact on the valuation of the warrants as of december  results of operations years ended december  and revenue we recorded total revenue of million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  total revenue in consisted primarily of a million milestone payment received pursuant to our license agreement with merck for the acceptance of an application for regulatory approval in europe of ridaforolimus for the sarcoma indication 
total revenue in consisted of license and collaboration revenue of million and service revenue of million 
license and collaboration revenue in included the million up front payment and a million payment for our share of ridaforolimus costs incurred from january  to may  from merck pursuant to the terms of the license agreement 
license and collaboration revenue in also included million representing the recognition in of revenue deferred as of december  under our accounting for the collaboration agreement  which was recognized upon execution of the license agreement 
service revenue of million in the year ended december  consisted of transition services that we provided to merck pursuant to the license agreement 
we expect that our revenue in will be primarily dependent on the status of regulatory approvals for ridaforolimus which could result in milestone payments from merck 
pursuant to the license agreement  merck has agreed to pay us up to million associated with regulatory approvals of ridaforolimus for the sarcoma indication  consisting of million for marketing approval in the united states  million for approval to sell ridaforolimus in the european union  including first pricing and reimbursement approval granted by a regulatory authority in any major european country or by the ema  and million for marketing approval of ridaforolimus in japan 
merck submitted applications for approval of ridaforolimus in the united states and in europe in  which are currently under review 
in addition  if ridaforolimus receives regulatory approval and merck commences sales  we would also be entitled to receive tiered double digit royalties on global net sales under the license agreement  although in we do not expect such royalty revenue will be material to our results of operations 
there can be no assurance that ridaforolimus will receive regulatory approval  or if it does  that it will be commercially successful 
operating expenses research and development expenses research and development expenses increased by million  or percent  to million in  compared to million in the research and development process necessary to develop a pharmaceutical product for commercialization is subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the united states and other countries 
this process typically takes years to complete and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
current requirements include preclinical toxicology  pharmacology and metabolism studies  as well as in vivo efficacy studies in relevant animal models of disease  manufacturing of drug product for preclinical studies and clinical trials and ultimately for commercial supply  submission of the results of preclinical studies and information regarding manufacturing and control and proposed clinical protocol to the us food and drug administration  or fda  in an investigational new drug application  or ind or similar filings with regulatory agencies outside the united states  conduct of clinical trials designed to provide data and information regarding the safety and efficacy of the product candidate in humans  and submission of all the results of testing to the fda in a new drug application  or nda or similar filings with regulatory agencies outside the united states 
upon approval by the appropriate regulatory authorities  including in some countries approval of product pricing  we may commence commercial marketing and distribution of the product 
we group our research and development  or r d  expenses into two major categories direct external expenses and all other r d expenses 
direct external expenses consist of costs of outside parties to conduct laboratory studies  to develop manufacturing processes and manufacture product candidates  to conduct and manage clinical trials and similar costs related to our clinical and preclinical studies 
these costs are accumulated and tracked by product candidate 
all other r d expenses consist of costs to compensate personnel  to purchase lab supplies and services  to lease  operate and maintain our facility  equipment and overhead and similar costs of our research and development efforts 
these costs apply to our clinical and preclinical candidates as well as our discovery research efforts 
direct external expenses are further categorized as costs for clinical programs and costs for preclinical programs 
preclinical programs include product candidates undergoing toxicology  pharmacology  metabolism and efficacy studies and manufacturing process development required before testing in humans can begin 
product candidates are designated as clinical programs once we have filed an ind with the fda  or a similar filing with regulatory agencies outside the united states  for the purpose of commencing clinical trials in humans 
our r d expenses for as compared to were as follows year ended december  increase in thousands decrease direct external expenses clinical programs preclinical programs all other r d expenses in  our clinical programs consisted of ponatinib  our pan bcr abl inhibitor  and ap  our alk and egfr inhibitor for which we filed an ind in june and commenced a phase clinical trial in the third quarter of in  our clinical programs consisted of ponatinib and ridaforolimus which we licensed to merck in may the direct external expenses for ridaforolimus in reflect our share of the global development costs of ridaforolimus  including our share of merck s costs  pursuant to the cost sharing arrangement of our collaboration with merck in effect through may  direct external expenses for ponatinib were million in  an increase of million as compared to the increase is due to an increase in clinical trial costs of million  contract manufacturing costs of million  and supporting non clinical costs of million 
clinical trials costs increased primarily due to increased enrollment and treatment of patients in our pivotal phase clinical trial offset in part by a decrease in costs of our phase clinical trial as treatment of patients and other activities in this trial have decreased over this time period 
contract manufacturing costs increased due primarily to the conduct of product and process development and qualification initiatives to support regulatory filings for this product candidate  as well as the production of ponatinib for use in our clinical trials 
supporting non clinical costs increased due primarily to increased quality and stability studies and initiatives to develop and commercialize a companion diagnostic test to identify the ti mutation of the bcr abl gene 
we expect that our direct external expenses for ponatinib will increase in as we continue to treat patients in our ongoing phase and phase clinical trials  initiate additional clinical trials of this product candidate  conduct additional studies to support continued development of ponatinib  and prepare and potentially file applications for regulatory approval of this product candidate 
direct external expenses for ap were million for the year ended december   of which million were included in clinical programs and million were included in preclinical programs in the table above reflecting the transfer of this program to a clinical development status in the third quarter of direct external expenses for ap were million for the year ended december   which were entirely included in preclinical programs 
the increase in expenses for ap was due primarily to the initiation of our phase clinical trial for this product candidate in the third quarter of as well as on going product and process development initiatives and production of ap for use in clinical trials 
we expect that our direct external expenses for ap will increase in as we continue to enroll patients in our on going clinical trial of this product candidate and conduct additional studies to support continued development of ap we incurred no expenses for the development of ridaforolimus in the year ended december   because merck agreed to fund percent of such costs pursuant to the license agreement entered into in may direct external expenses for ridaforolimus amounted to million in  reflecting our share of the costs of global development of this product candidate with merck  including our share of merck s costs  pursuant to the cost sharing arrangement of our collaboration with merck in effect through may  all other r d expenses increased by million in as compared to this increase is primarily due to a decrease of million in merck s reimbursement to us for our services pursuant to the collaboration agreement in effect until may  an increase in professional services of million due primarily to initiatives to upgrade systems and technology used in our business  an increase in stock based compensation expense of million as a result of the impact of a significant increase in the market value of our common stock on the value of stock based awards in  an increase in rent expense of million as a result of our amendment to our building lease and an increase in other expenses as a result of a one time credit received in of  related to grants awarded to us by the internal revenue service under the qualified therapeutic discovery project  or qtdp  program established by the us congress in march as part of the patient protection and affordable care act 
these increases were offset in part by a decrease in other personnel costs of million due to a lower average number of employees in as compared to and a decrease in expenses related to our intellectual property  primarily due to a decrease in impairment charges of million as we reserved or wrote off the carrying value of patents related to our nf kb and argent technologies in we expect that all other r d expenses will increase in to support the expanding development of ponatinib and ap  the preparation and potential filing of world wide regulatory filings for ponatinib  and our ongoing discovery research efforts 
the successful development of our product candidates is uncertain and subject to a number of risks 
we cannot be certain that any of our product candidates will prove to be safe and effective or will meet all of the applicable regulatory requirements needed to receive and maintain marketing approval 
data from preclinical studies and clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
we  the fda or other regulatory authorities may suspend clinical trials at any time if we or they believe that the subjects participating in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable risks or if such regulatory agencies find deficiencies in the conduct of the trials or other problems with our products under development 
delays or rejections may be encountered based on additional governmental regulation  legislation  administrative action or changes in fda or other regulatory policy during development or the review process 
other risks associated with our product development programs are described in the section entitled risk factors in part i  item a of this annual report 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by million  or percent  from million in to million in this increase was due primarily to an increase in professional services of million as a result of an increase in corporate and commercial development initiatives to plan and prepare for the potential commercial launch of ridaforolimus and ponatinib  an increase in stock based compensation expense of million due to the impact of a significant increase in the market value of our common stock on the value of stock based compensation awards in  a decrease of  in merck s reimbursement to us for our services pursuant to the collaboration agreement in effect until may  as well as an increase in costs to recruit personnel  travel costs and other miscellaneous costs 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in as we prepare for potential commercial launch of ponatinib in the united states and in europe  including the hiring of sales  marketing and commercial operations personnel and the establishment of our european headquarters and operations  and support our expanding research and development activities 
we expect that our operating expenses in total will increase substantially in for the reasons described above 
operating expenses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
the actual amount of any increase in operating expenses will depend on  among other things  the status of regulatory reviews and timing of potential regulatory approvals of our product candidates  the costs to prepare for potential commercial launch of ponatinib in the united states and in europe  the progress of our product development programs  including on going and planned clinical trials  results of continuing non clinical studies and the costs of product and process development activities and product manufacturing 
other income expense interest income interest income increased by percent to  in from  in  as a result of a higher average balance of funds invested in interest expense interest expense increased by percent to  in from  in  due to higher average borrowings in revaluation of warrant liability the fair value of our warrant liability at december  was million higher than its fair value at december   due to the net impact of the exercise of warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock during and the revaluation of our warrant liability at december  the revaluation of our warrant liability resulted in a non cash charge of million for the year ended december  and was due primarily to increases in the market price of our common stock from per share at december   to per share at december  the revaluation of our warrant liability in resulted in a non cash charge of million for the year ended december  increases in our stock price during january and february  during which time all remaining warrants were exercised  will result in additional charges to be reported in our consolidated statement of operations in the first quarter of such charges will not have any impact on our cash balances  current liquidity or cash flows 
upon the exercise of those remaining warrants  the balance of the warrant liability was credited to stockholders equity and the liability was eliminated 
operating results we reported a loss from operations of million in compared to income from operations of million in  an increase in loss of million 
this change is due primarily to the decrease in revenue as a result of the accounting impact of the license agreement entered into with merck in may and the increase in operating expenses discussed above 
we also reported a net loss of million in compared to net income of million in  an increase in net loss of million reflecting the change in loss from operations noted above plus the revaluation of the warrant liability 
we expect that our loss from operations will increase in due to expected increases in research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses as described above 
our actual results of operations for will depend on a number of factors  including the status of regulatory reviews and timing of potential regulatory approvals of our product candidates  the costs to prepare for potential commercial launch of ponatinib in the united states and in europe  the progress of our product development programs  the progress of our discovery research programs  the receipt of milestone payments  the exercise of warrants  and changes in the valuation of our warrant liability  among other factors 
the extent of operating losses in future years may also depend on the sufficiency of funds on hand or available from time to time  which will influence the amount we will spend on operations and capital expenditures as well as the development timelines for our product candidates 
years ended december  and revenue we recorded total revenue of million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  total revenue in consisted of license and collaboration revenue of million and service revenue of million 
license and collaboration revenue in included the million up front payment and a million payment for our share of ridaforolimus costs incurred from january  to may  from merck pursuant to the terms of the license agreement 
license and collaboration revenue in also included million representing the recognition in of revenue deferred as of december  under our accounting for the collaboration agreement  which was recognized upon execution of the license agreement 
service revenue of million in the year ended december  consisted of transition services that we provided to merck pursuant to the terms of the license agreement 
operating expenses research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased by million  or percent  to million in  compared to million in our r d expenses for as compared to were as follows year ended december  increase in thousands decrease direct external expenses clinical programs preclinical programs all other r d expenses in and  our clinical programs consisted of ridaforolimus and ponatinib 
the direct external expenses for ridaforolimus reflect our share of the global development costs of ridaforolimus  including our share of merck s costs  pursuant to the cost sharing arrangement of our collaboration with merck in effect through may  direct external expenses for ponatinib were million in  an increase of million compared to the increase was due to an increase in contract manufacturing costs of million  clinical trial costs of million and supporting non clinical costs of  offset in part by a decrease in toxicology costs of million 
toxicology costs decreased due to the completion in of long term toxicology studies necessary to support development of this product candidate 
clinical trials costs increased due to continued enrollment and treatment of patients in our phase clinical trial as well as preparation for and initiation of enrollment of patients in our pivotal phase clinical trial 
contract manufacturing costs increased due to continuing product and process development initiatives as well as the production of ponatinib for use in these clinical trials 
direct external expenses for ridaforolimus were million in  a decrease of million  compared to the decrease was primarily due to the restructuring of our collaboration with merck  under which merck is responsible for and funds percent of the cost of ridaforolimus from may  therefore  our expenses during reflected our share of ridaforolimus costs from january  to may   including our share of merck s costs  pursuant to the cost sharing arrangement of our collaboration with merck in effect through may   compared to a full twelve months in the year ended december  direct external expenses for our preclinical program were million in  an increase of  compared to this increase in expenses was related to manufacturing and other ind enabling studies for ap all other r d expenses increased by million in as compared to this increase was due in part to the termination in of the cost sharing provisions for ridaforolimus under our collaboration agreement with merck 
in  we received million less in reimbursement from merck than in for its share of our internal costs charged to merck pursuant to the collaboration agreement 
this reimbursement provision ended effective may  with the execution of the license agreement under which we invoiced merck for our services and recorded such amounts as service revenue during the balance of the increase was also due to an increase of million in expenses related to intellectual property protection of our r d programs  primarily due to reserves for and write offs of certain technologies 
these increases were offset in part by a credit of  related to grants awarded to us by the internal revenue service under the qualified therapeutic discovery project  or qtdp  program established by the us congress in march as part of the patient protection and affordable care act 
this credit was recorded as an offset to the related r d expenses 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased by  or percent  from million in to million in this decrease was due primarily to a decrease in professional services of million related primarily to a reduction in corporate and commercial development initiatives and legal fees for patent litigation 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in personnel expenses of  due to salary increases and annual performance awards  an increase in overhead and other expenses of  and a decrease of  in reimbursement from merck for its share of our internal costs charged to merck pursuant to the collaboration agreement 
other income expense interest income interest income decreased by percent to  in from  in  as a result of lower interest yields from our invested funds  offset in part by a higher average balance of funds invested in interest expense interest expense decreased by percent to  in from  in  due to lower average loan balances and lower interest rates in revaluation of warrant liability the fair value of our warrant liability at december  was million higher than its fair value at december   due to the net impact of the exercise of warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock in the second quarter of and the revaluation of our warrant liability at december  the revaluation of our warrant liability resulted in a non cash charge of million for the year ended december  and was due primarily to increases in the market price of our common stock since december  the revaluation of our warrant liability in resulted in a non cash charge of million for the year ended december  operating results we reported income from operations of million in compared to a loss from operations of million in  an increase in income of million 
the increase in income from operations was primarily due to the recognition of approximately million in license and collaboration revenue as a result of the accounting impact of the license agreement entered into with merck in may  and a decrease in our share of the costs of development of ridaforolimus 
we also reported net income of million in compared to a net loss of million in  an increase in net income of million 
the increase in income was largely due to the impact of the license agreement with merck  offset in part by the revaluation of our warrant liability described above 
selected quarterly financial data summarized unaudited quarterly financial data are as follows in thousands  except per share amounts first second third fourth total revenue net income loss net income loss per share basic diluted in thousands  except per share amounts first second third fourth total revenue net income loss net income loss per share basic diluted in the third quarter of  we earned a million milestone payment from merck as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in may  we entered into an amended and restated agreement with merck for the development and commercialization of ridaforolimus that provided for an up front payment of million and resulted in the recognition at that time of previously deferred revenue 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations and investments to date primarily through sales of our common stock in public and private offerings  through the receipt of up front and milestone payments from collaborations and licenses with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and  to a lesser extent  through issuances of our common stock pursuant to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans  supplemented by the borrowing of long term debt from commercial lenders 
we sell securities and incur debt when the terms of such transactions are deemed favorable to us and as necessary to fund our current and projected cash needs 
we seek to balance the level of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand with our projected needs and to allow us to withstand periods of uncertainty relative to the availability of funding on favorable terms 
sources of funds during the years ended december   and  our sources of funds were as follows in thousands sales issuances of common stock in common stock offerings upon exercise of warrants pursuant to stock option and employee stock purchase plans proceeds from long term borrowings up front and milestone payments from merck  included in cash provided by used in operating activities our up front and milestone payments from merck were received pursuant to the license agreement entered into in may these payments are included in cash provided by used in operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended december  and but are presented separately in this analysis due to the non recurring nature of these payments 
the amount of funding we seek to raise through sales of our common stock or other securities depends on many factors  including  but not limited to  our plans for and the expected costs of the potential commercialization of our product candidates  the status and progress of our product development programs and potential regulatory approvals  the receipt of potential milestone payments and royalties from merck  projected cash needs  availability of funding from other sources  our stock price and the status of the capital markets 
on february   we sold  shares of our common stock in a registered direct offering to institutional investors  at a purchase price of per share  resulting in net proceeds after fees and expenses of million 
the investors also received warrants to purchase an additional  shares of our common stock exercisable at a price of per share in cash or pursuant to the net exercise provisions of the warrants 
the warrants became exercisable on august  and expired on february  in the year ended december    warrants were exercised for proceeds to us of million 
in the year ended december    warrants were exercised for proceeds to us of approximately million 
prior to exercise  the warrants were recorded at fair value  with the adjustment to carrying value recognized in earnings upon exercise 
the sum of the fair value of the exercised warrants and the proceeds received were credited to additional paid in capital and totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
at december   there were  warrants outstanding which were exercised in january and february for proceeds to us of approximately million 
on august   we sold  shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering  including  shares of common stock upon exercise by the underwriters of their over allotment option  at a purchase price of per share 
net proceeds of this offering  after underwriting discounts and commissions and direct expenses  were million 
on october   we sold  shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering at a purchase price of per share 
net proceeds of this offering  after underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses  were approximately million 
on december   we sold  shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering at a purchase price of per share 
net proceeds of this offering  after underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses  were approximately million 
we have filed shelf registration statements with the us securities and exchange commission  or sec  from time to time  to register shares of our common stock or other securities for sale  giving us the opportunity to raise funding when needed or otherwise considered appropriate 
under sec rules  we currently qualify as a well known seasoned issuer  which allows us to file shelf registration statements to register an unspecified amount of securities that are effective upon filing 
on december   we filed such a shelf registration statement with the sec for the issuance of an unspecified amount of common stock  preferred stock  various series of debt securities and or warrants to purchase any of such securities  either individually or in units  from time to time at prices and on terms to be determined at the time of any such offering 
this filing was effective upon filing and will remain in effect for up to three years from filing 
in addition  before we qualified as a well known seasoned issuer  we filed a shelf registration statement for various classes of securities under which we have approximately million of securities remaining available for issuance prior to january  in january  we amended our existing term loan with a bank 
the amendment increased the outstanding balance of the loan from million at december  to million  extends the maturity date from march  to december   and re sets the quarterly repayment provisions  with payments increasing from percent of the principal amount in the first quarter  commencing on march   to percent of the principal amount in the final quarter  together with interest throughout the term of the loan 
all other provisions of our existing loan remain in full force and effect 
uses of funds the primary uses of our cash are to fund our operations and working capital requirements and  to a lesser degree  to repay our long term debt  to invest in intellectual property and to invest in property and equipment as needed for our business 
our uses of cash during the years ended december   and were as follows in thousands net cash used in provided by operating activities adjusted for up front and milestone payments from merck adjusted net cash used in provided by operating activities repayment of long term borrowings and capital leases investment in intangible assets investment in property and equipment payment of tax withholding obligations related to stock compensation the net cash used in provided by operating activities is comprised of our net income losses  adjusted for non cash expenses  changes in deferred revenue  including any required deferrals of the up front and milestone payments received from licenses  and working capital requirements 
as noted above  our net loss for the year ended december  increased by million  as compared to  due in large part to the accounting impact of the license agreement entered into with merck in may  which triggered the acceleration of the recognition of million of previously deferred revenue as income in  and the revaluation of our warrant liability 
after taking into account these non cash items  and after adjusting for the million up front payment in and million milestone payment in from merck pursuant to the license agreement  our adjusted net cash used in operating activities increased by million in compared to these changes reflect overall increases in operating expenses of million and changes in working capital 
as noted above  we expect that we will incur a net loss in due to ongoing development of our product candidates and preparation for potential commercialization of our product candidates in the united states and europe  that our investment in intangible assets  consisting of our intellectual property  will increase in in support of our product development and commercialization activities  and that our investment in property and equipment will increase in to support growth of our r d and general and administrative functions 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities for financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we maintained outstanding letters of credit of  in accordance with the terms of our long term lease for our office and laboratory facility and for other purposes 
contractual obligations we have substantial fixed contractual obligations under our long term debt agreement  operating and capital lease agreements  employment agreements and benefit plans 
these non cancellable contractual obligations were comprised of the following as of december  payments due by period in thousands total in through through after long term debt leases employment agreements other long term obligations long term debt consists of scheduled principal payments on such debt 
interest on our long term debt is based on variable interest rates 
assuming a constant interest rate of percent  our average interest rate on our debt at december   over the remaining term of the debt  our interest expense would total approximately  in and  in the period through leases consist of payments to be made on our lease for our office and laboratory facility  the term of which extends to july  and on agreements for certain assets acquired under capital leases which expire at various dates into employment agreements represent base salary payments under agreements with officers that extend for fixed terms ranging from one to two years 
other long term obligations are comprised primarily of our obligations under our executive deferred compensation plan 
liquidity at december   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million and working capital of million  compared to cash and cash equivalents totaling million and working capital of million at december  in addition  at december   we had warrants outstanding to purchase  shares of our common stock from our registered direct offering of common stock in february  which were exercised in january and february for approximately million in gross proceeds 
for the year ended december   we reported a net loss of million and cash used in operating activities of million 
based on our current operating plan  we believe that our cash and cash equivalents at december   together with the proceeds of warrant exercises received in and anticipated milestones and royalty payments from merck assuming regulatory approval of ridaforolimus  will be sufficient to fund our operations to the end of we do not have significant recurring revenue streams and have historically incurred operating losses and net losses related to our research and development activities 
we expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses and that our operating expenses will increase substantially in and beyond 
we plan to expand our development of our product candidates  ponatinib and ap  and will conduct additional clinical trials and continue manufacturing related and other activities in support of these efforts 
subject to our filing for and receipt of marketing approval  we plan to commercialize ponatinib and future product candidates on our own in the united states  europe and other select markets worldwide  which will require increased spending to establish sales  marketing and distribution capabilities in these markets 
we also plan to continue to invest in discovery research and add to our pipeline of product candidates through these activities 
there are many factors that will affect our level of spending on these activities including the number  size and complexity of  and rate of enrollment of patients in  our clinical trials for ponatinib and ap  the extent of other development activities for ponatinib and ap  including product and process development  the progress of our preclinical and discovery research programs  the status of regulatory reviews and timing of potential regulatory approvals  in the united states  europe and other markets of ponatinib  ridaforolimus and other product candidates  the size of the workforce and required systems and infrastructure necessary to support commercialization of our product candidates in multiple markets and other factors 
we currently have no drug products approved for sale 
until such time  if ever  that we receive regulatory approval for our product candidates and generate significant revenues from sales of our product candidates  we plan to continue to fund our operations through the potential receipt of milestone payments under our existing licenses by issuing common stock  debt or other securities in public or private offerings  or by incurring additional debt from commercial lenders 
under our license agreement with merck  we will be eligible to receive up to million in additional milestone payments related to the sarcoma indication consisting of million for marketing approval in the united states  million for approval to sell ridaforolimus in the european union  including first pricing and reimbursement approval granted by a regulatory authority in any major european country or by the ema  and million for marketing approval in japan 
in addition to milestone payments  if ridaforolimus receives regulatory approval  merck has agreed to pay us tiered double digit royalties on global net sales of ridaforolimus 
we have also exercised our option to co promote ridaforolimus with merck in the united states  subject to the terms of a co promotion agreement being negotiated by the parties  pursuant to which merck will reimburse us for our sales efforts 
in addition to the license agreement with merck  we also have existing license agreements with two companies  medinol ltd 
and icon medical corporation  for the development and commercialization of ridaforolimus eluting stents  and other licenses of our argent technology 
if medinol  icon or the other licensees are successful in the development or commercialization of potential products or otherwise generate revenue from these licenses  we will be eligible to receive milestone payments and or royalties on sales of products 
we may also seek to raise funds by issuing common stock  debt or other securities in one or more public or private offerings  as market conditions permit  or through the incurrence of additional debt from commercial lenders 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted  and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our stockholders 
debt financing  if available  may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions  such as incurring debt  making capital expenditures or declaring dividends 
there can be no assurance that additional funds will be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis  we may be required to delay  limit  reduce or terminate preclinical studies  clinical trials or other clinical development activities for one or more of our product candidates  delay  limit  reduce or terminate our discovery research or preclinical development activities  or delay  limit  reduce or terminate our establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities that may be necessary to commercialize our product candidates 
recently adopted or issued accounting pronouncements in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 revenue recognition milestone method  which provides guidance on determining whether a milestone is substantive including the criteria that must be met for a milestone to be considered a substantive milestone and the recognition of consideration received upon achievement of a substantive milestone 
asu no 
is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after june  we adopted this asu on january  with no material impact on our financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued authoritative guidance that modifies the accounting for multiple element revenue arrangements 
this guidance requires an entity to allocate revenue to each unit of accounting in multiple deliverable arrangements based on the relative selling price of each deliverable 
it also changes the level of evidence of stand alone selling prices required to separate deliverables by requiring an entity to make its best estimate of the stand alone selling price of the deliverables when more objective evidence of selling price is not available 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  and may be applied prospectively to new or materially modified arrangements after the effective date or retrospectively 
we adopted this guidance on january  and although the adoption did not materially impact our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows  this guidance may impact our determination of the separation of deliverables for future arrangements 
in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 presentation of comprehensive income  which eliminates the presentation options currently in accounting standards codification asc topic and requires the presentation of other comprehensive income in either a continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
asu no 
is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  and requires retrospective application 
this guidance will require a change in the presentation of our financial statements  however  we do not believe that it will have a material impact unless we have components of other comprehensive income other than net income loss 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our available funds in accordance with our investment policy to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
when we conclude that cash balances will be invested  we invest in short term  highly liquid securities  with original maturities of days or less  and money market accounts 
depending on our level of available funds and our expected cash requirements  we may invest a portion of our funds in marketable securities  consisting generally of corporate debt and us government and agency securities 
maturities of our marketable securities are generally limited to periods necessary to fund our liquidity needs and may not in any case exceed three years 
our investments are sensitive to interest rate risk 
however  because our available funds at december   were invested solely in cash and cash equivalents  our risk of loss due to changes in interest rates is not material 
at december   we have recorded as a liability the fair value of warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock issued to investors in connection with a registered direct offering of our common stock on february  the fair value of this warrant liability is sensitive to changes in the market price and volatility of our common stock among other factors 
in the event of a hypothetical increase in the market price based on the market price of our stock at december  of our common stock on which the december  valuation was based  the value would have increased by up to million 
such increase would have been reflected as additional loss on revaluation of the warrant liability in our statement of operations 
at december   we had million outstanding under a bank term note which bears interest at prime or  alternatively  libor plus to percent 
this note is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
in the event of a hypothetical percent increase in the interest rate on which the loan is based basis points at december   we would incur approximately  of additional interest expense per year based on expected balances over the next twelve months
