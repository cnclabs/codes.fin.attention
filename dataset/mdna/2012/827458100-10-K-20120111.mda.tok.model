item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation we have approved an exploration budget of million for calendar year this exploration program includes a planned  meter drilling program targeting the centenario zone and the western extension of the shallow silver zone 
additionally  this program includes a planned  meter underground drilling program targeting along the kilometer parrena adit which lies immediately south of the shallow silver zone 
the parrena adit has not been previously drilled 
metallurgical studies we have recently hired two metallurgical experts to lead our metallurgical program in the goal of this program will be to test the silver for heap and agitation cyanide leach methods 
we will also look to see how any low grade zinc which reports with the silver mineralization can be recovered 
we will also review all of the previous metallurgical work completed on the zinc zone 
continued improvement of the sierra mojada infrastructure the sierra mojada project office and camp facilities received a major facelift and upgrade in to improve on the serviceability and utility of the facilities and the safety surrounding activity on the grounds of the facility 
exploration of land position during we conducted an extensive exploration program on three prospects  san francisco  palomas negros  and dormidos which lie outside the immediate mineralized zone at sierra mojada 
initial mapping and prospecting over these areas looked promising 
only san francisco was drilled in  and although intercepting silver and zinc mineralization up to meters in width it is not deemed to be a priority target for follow up work and drilling are planned on the other two prospects in health and safety and environment a health  safety  and environment audit of the sierra mojada project site by outside consultants completed in and then again in mid revealed the project was in need of improved health and safety awareness programs  and facilities 
training of staff  coupled with new procedures and emphasis on safe work practices has greatly improve the safety on the site 
new first aid facilities and services provided by trained first aiders has also been setup 
since implementing these new safety protocols and awareness programs among employees and contractors the minor accident incident rate on the project has been reduced significantly 
gabon  africa licenses and interests we  through our wholly owned subsidiary dome  own three exploration licenses ndjole  mevang  and mitzic each covering approximately  square kilometers in gabon  africa 
these concessions are without known reserves and the project is exploratory in nature 
the mitzic license  the mevang license and the ndjole license are approximately km east of libreville  the capital of gabon 
in november  dome was granted the mitzic prospection permit covering  square kilometers in gabon 
in july of  dome converted three areas of the mitzic prospection permit into three exploration licenses  namely the mitzic exploration license  the mevang exploration license and the ndjole exploration license  each covering an area of  square kilometers 
the mitzic license  the mevang license and the ndjole license allow dome to explore an aggregate of  square kilometers 
dome may employ sub surface exploration methods  such as drilling and trial mining to look for potential gold  iron and manganese projects 
these licenses are valid for three years  are transferable and are renewable twice for three year periods 
applications for license renewal were submitted to the government in june we expect these license renewals to be issued in early the mitzic  mevang  and ndjole exploration licenses take in areas of archaean basement rocks and palaeo proterozic cover sequences that are highly prospective for gold  manganese and iron 
an extensive stream sampling campaign conducted by the french geological survey in the s and s identified numerous stream anomalies within these areas that had never been explored with modern exploration methods due to the dense cover of equatorial rainforest  low population of the country  and the government s previous focus on petroleum and forestry 
the mitzic exploration license takes in a series of archaean rocks that include greenstone belts and banded iron formations  rocks and is highly prospective for iron ore 
the ndjole and mevang exploration licenses take in palaeo proterozoic rocks that form part of the central west african orogenic belt  and are strongly deformed and metamorphosed to greenschist facies  making them highly prospective for large orogenic type gold deposits 
the ndjole license also takes in structural disruptions associated with a second continental scale structure  the ikoye ikobe fault 
this area is characterized by extensive artisinal gold workings of which the gold is thought to come from a local primary source 
as further set forth below  two of dome s licenses  ndjole and mevang  are currently being explored pursuant to a joint venture agreement with a subsidiary of anglogold ashanti anglogold 
dome s third license  the mitzic license  has iron ore potential and we are looking for a joint venture partner on this license 
additionally  dome also has a joint venture interest in the ogooue license that is owned by anglogold 
although we believe these properties merit future exploration activities  our activities are at a preliminary stage and we do not consider any of the properties to be individually material 
joint venture agreements in october  dome and anglogold  an international gold mining company  entered into two joint venture agreements 
the first joint venture agreement called the ndjole and mevang joint venture agreement refers to exploration specifically carried out by anglogold on the ndjole and mevang licenses which are owned by dome 
the second joint venture agreement called the ogooue joint venture agreement refers specifically to exploration carried out by anglogold on the ogooue prospection permit which is owned by anglogold 
project management between october and august was managed by dome staff 
effective august anglogold assumed the role of project manager for both the ogooue joint venture and the ndjole and mevang joint venture 
ndjole and mevang joint venture agreement dome is the owner of the ndjole and mevang exploration licenses  each comprised of  square kilometers 
under the terms of the joint venture  anglogold earned a interest by paying dome  upon signing of the joint venture agreement in october anglogold can earn an additional interest by paying dome  per year from through and by incurring exploration expenditures in the amount of million from through at the rate of million in the first year  million in the second year and million in the third year 
once it has earned a interest  anglogold can earn an additional interest total by spending million on exploration expenditures within two years of earning into a interest as set out above 
when the parties have a joint venture and if dome elects not to contribute to work programs and budgets  anglogold can elect to earn an additional interest total by carrying the project to a completed pre feasibility study 
should anglogold fail to perform as set out above  a interest in the licenses shall revert to dome and the joint venture will cease 
anglogold is entitled to withdraw from the joint venture after it has spent million on exploration expenditures 
joint venture dilution provisions apply whereby if dome is diluted in the future to a joint venture interest of or less due to lack of contribution to exploration budgets  its interests will be converted to a net smelter return which can be purchased at appraised value months after commencement of commercial production 
a  meter drill program finished at the beginning of june on dome s ndjole and mevang properties 
the drilling mainly focused on two significant gold anomalies in the ndjole license which are above parts per billion and both in excess of km in length 
these anomalies were previously identified through mapping and soil sampling in the area and appear to be associated with major lithological contacts and structures in the area 
gold intercepts between meter and meters in thickness were encountered with the best intercept being meters at g t gold 
most intercepts were in the meter to meter range at to g t gold 
anglogold currently owns of each the ndjole and mevang licences 
as of october   anglogold has incurred expenditures of approximately million and subject to a payment to dome of  on or before october  will acquire of the total project 
ogooue joint venture agreement anglogold acquired a reconnaissance license over an area comprising  square kilometers in gabon  africa 
this license was acquired by anglogold for its gold potential 
in october  dome and anglogold ashanti entered into a joint venture agreement establishing a joint venture in which anglogold holds an interest and dome holds a interest 
dome played a key role in identifying the ground covered by the licensee and assisting with the application 
anglogold agreed to spend a minimum of  on exploration and will fund the first million of exploration expenditures  after which the parties will contribute on an basis 
should anglogold not meet its funding obligation  the license will be assigned to dome 
joint venture dilution provisions apply and if dome s interest in the joint venture is diluted to or less due to lack of contribution to exploration budgets  its interests will be converted to a net smelter return which can be purchased at an appraised value months after commencement of commercial production 
as of october   anglogold has spent approximately  on the ogooue property 
in july anglogold applied to reduce the ground by applying for an exploration license over areas consider prospect 
dome will hold a interest in this license when it is granted by the government of gabon 
gabon facility our facilities in gabon include three rented offices which double as accommodation for staff 
two of the offices are located in the capital city of libreville  and one field office is located in the village of ndjole 
the libreville offices include an office house used by dome staff to coordinate exploration activities involving the mitzic license  and an office house used by the dome anglogold ashanti joint venture to coordinate and manage exploration activities for the ndjole and mevang licenses 
the ndjole field office is four hours by sealed road due east from libreville and is the main staging point for exploration activities for work on the ndjole and mevang licenses 
field based activities from here are run out of tented field camps 
electricity for all offices is supplied from the local grid and from light diesel generators for field camps

competition and mineral prices silver and zinc are commodities  and their prices are volatile 
during  the price of silver ranged from a low of per ounce to a high of per ounce  and the price of zinc ranged from a low of  per tonne to a high of  per tonne 
silver and zinc prices are affected by many factors beyond our control  including prevailing interest rates and returns on other asset classes  expectations regarding inflation  speculation  currency values  governmental decisions regarding the disposal of precious metals stockpiles  global and regional demand and production  political and economic conditions and other factors 
the competitive nature of the business and the risks we are therefore faced with are discussed further in the item entitled risk factors  below 
the following tables set forth for the periods indicated on the london metal exchange high and low silver and zinc prices in us dollars per troy ounce and per tonne  respectively 
on october   the closing price of silver was per troy ounce 
on october   the closing price of zinc was  per tonne 
silver year high low zinc year high low government regulation mineral exploration activities are subject to various national  state provincial  and local laws and regulations  which govern prospecting  development  mining  production  exports  taxes  labor standards  occupational health  waste disposal  protection of the environment  mine safety  hazardous substances and other matters 
similarly  if any of our properties are developed and or mined those activities are also subject to significant governmental regulation and oversight 
we will obtain the licenses  permits or other authorizations currently required to conduct our exploration program 
we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable mining  health  safety and environmental statutes and the regulations applicable to the mineral interests we now hold in mexico and gabon 
environment regulations our activities are subject to various national and local laws and regulations governing protection of the environment 
these laws are continually changing and  in general  are becoming more restrictive 
we intend to conduct business in a way that safeguards public health and the environment 
we will conduct our operational compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
changes to current state or federal laws and regulations in mexico and gabon could  in the future  require additional capital expenditures and increased operating and or reclamation costs 
although we are unable to predict what additional legislation  if any  might be proposed or enacted  additional regulatory requirements could impact the economics of our projects 
during fiscal  we had no material environmental incidents or non compliance with any applicable environmental regulations

item a 
risk factors our securities are highly speculative and involve a high degree of risk 
our business  operating or financial condition could be harmed due to any of the following risks 
accordingly  investors should carefully consider these risks in making a decision as to whether to purchase  sell or hold our securities 
in addition  investors should note that the risks described below are not the only risks facing us 
additional risks not presently known to us  or risks that do not seem significant today  may also impair our business operations in the future 
you should carefully consider the risks described below before making a decision to invest in our securities 
risks related to our business we are an exploration stage mining company with no history of operations 
we are an exploration stage enterprise engaged in mineral exploration in mexico and gabon  africa 
we have a very limited operating history and are subject to all the risks inherent in a new business enterprise 
as an exploration stage company  we may never enter the development and production stages 
to date we have had no revenues and have relied upon equity financing to fund our operations 
the likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the problems  expenses  difficulties  complications  and delays frequently encountered in connection with an exploration stage business  and the competitive and regulatory environment in which we operate and will operate  such as under capitalization  personnel limitations  and limited financing sources 
we have no commercially mineable ore body 
no commercially mineable ore body has been delineated on our sierra mojada project or on our exploration licenses in gabon  africa  nor have our properties been shown to contain proven or probable mineral reserves 
srk consulting canada  inc recently completed a technical report on the silver mineralization of the shallow silver zone at the sierra mojada project 
we cannot assure you that any mineral deposits we identify on the sierra mojada project  in gabon or on another property will qualify as an ore body that can be legally and economically exploited or that any particular level of recovery of silver or other minerals from discovered mineralization will in fact be realized 
most exploration projects do not result in the discovery of commercially mineable ore deposits 
even if the presence of reserves is established at a project  the legal and economic viability of the project may not justify exploitation 
mineral resource estimates may not be reliable 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of mineralized material such as silver  zinc  lead  and gold  including many factors beyond our control  and no assurance can be given that the recovery of mineralized material will be realized 
in general  estimates of mineralized material are based upon a number of factors and assumptions made as of the date on which the estimates were determined  including geological and engineering estimates that have inherent uncertainties and the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies  the judgment of the engineers preparing the estimate  estimates of future metals prices and operating costs  the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  and the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  all of which may vary considerably from actual results 
all estimates are  to some degree  uncertain 
for these reasons  estimates of the recoverable mineral resources prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers at different times  may vary substantially 
as such  there is significant uncertainty in any mineralized material estimate and actual deposits encountered and the economic viability of a deposit may differ materially from our estimates 
our business plan is highly speculative and its success largely depends on the successful exploration of our sierra mojada concessions 
although we hold exploration licenses in gabon  our business plan is focused on exploring the sierra mojada concessions to identify reserves  and if appropriate  to ultimately develop this property 
further  although we have recently reported mineralized material on our sierra mojada project  we have not established any reserves and remain in the exploration stage 
we may never enter the development or production stage 
exploration of mineralization and determining whether the mineralization might be extracted profitably is highly speculative  and it may take a number of years until production is possible  during which time the economic viability of the project may change 
substantial expenditures are required to establish reserves  extract metals from ore and to construct mining and processing facilities 
the sierra mojada project is subject to all of the risks inherent in mineral exploration and development 
the economic feasibility of any mineral exploration and or development project is based upon  among other things  estimates of the size and grade of mineral reserves  proximity to infrastructures and other resources such as water and power  anticipated production rates  capital and operating costs  and metals prices 
development projects are also subject to the completion of favorable feasibility studies  issuance of necessary permits  and the ability to raise further capital to fund activities 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in overcoming these risks 
because of our focus on the sierra mojada project  the success of our operations and our profitability may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of adverse conditions unique to the torreon  mexico region  as the sierra mojada project is located kilometers north of this area 
due to our history of operating losses  we are uncertain that we will be able to maintain sufficient cash to accomplish our business objectives 
during the years ended october  and october   we suffered net losses of  and  respectively 
at october   we had stockholders equity of  and working capital of  significant amounts of capital will be required to continue to explore and potentially develop the sierra mojada concessions 
we are not engaged in any revenue producing activities and we do not expect to do so in the near future 
currently our sources of funding consist of the sale of additional equity securities  entering into joint venture agreements or selling a portion of our interests in our assets 
there is no assurance that any additional capital that we will require will be obtainable on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
failure to obtain such additional financing could result in delays or indefinite postponement of further exploration of our projects 
additional financing  if available  will likely result in substantial dilution to existing stockholders 
we may have difficulty meeting our current and future capital requirements 
our management and our board of directors monitor our overall costs and expenses and  if necessary  adjust our programs and planned expenditures in an attempt to ensure we have sufficient operating capital 
we continue to evaluate our costs and planned expenditures for our on going exploration efforts at our sierra mojada project 
we raised in excess of million during our fiscal year  increased our cash and cash equivalent assets by approximately million through the merger transaction with dome ventures corporation dome that occurred in april  and raised approximately million in a private placement in fiscal in addition  we raised approximately million from an offering of our common stock to certain investors that occurred in december however  the continued exploration and possible development of the sierra mojada project will require significant amounts of additional capital 
in addition  in the event anglogold funds its exploration commitment under the joint venture agreements with dome  we may require additional capital to further our interests in gabon 
as a result  we may need to explore raising additional capital during fiscal and beyond so that we can continue to fully fund our planned activities 
the extraordinary conditions in the global financial and capital markets have currently limited the availability of this funding 
if the disruptions in the global financial and capital markets continue  debt or equity financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
moreover  as a result of a late form k filing in  we are not eligible to use our shelf registration statement during the majority of because of that limitation  our ability to quickly access us capital markets will be somewhat constrained 
if we are unable to fund future operations by way of financing  including public or private offerings of equity or debt securities  our business  financial condition and exploration activities will be adversely impacted 
our exploration activities require significant amounts of capital that may not be recovered 
mineral exploration activities are subject to many risks  including the risk that no commercially productive or extractable resources will be encountered 
there can be no assurance that our activities will ultimately lead to an economically feasible project or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment 
mineral exploration often involves unprofitable efforts  including drilling operations that ultimately do not further our exploration efforts 
the cost of minerals exploration is often uncertain and cost overruns are common 
our drilling and exploration operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors  many of which are beyond our control  including title problems  weather conditions  compliance with governmental requirements  including permitting issues  and shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment and services 
we primarily rely on a third party to fund the exploration of our interests in gabon  africa 
in october  dome  which became our wholly owned subsidiary in april  entered into two joint venture agreements with anglogold for the exploration of its ndjole and mevang exploration licenses in gabon 
in addition  dome entered into a separate joint venture agreement with respect to a license held by a third party the ogooue license 
prior to dome entering into the joint venture agreement with respect to its license  it was not engaged in active exploration operations on its gabon licenses 
the terms of the joint venture agreements require anglogold to fund the initial and current exploration costs of two of our exploration licenses in order to earn an interest in the project 
should anglogold elect not to fund the exploration commitments under the joint venture agreements  the entire interest in the licenses would revert to dome and the joint venture will cease 
accordingly  we may have to temporarily or permanently scale back exploration of our gabon licenses and or attempt to identify another third party to fund the exploration efforts 
alternatively  we could suspend our exploration activities in gabon altogether 
our financial condition could be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates  especially between the us dollar and the mexican peso given our focus on the sierra  mojada project 
our financial condition is affected in part by currency exchange rates  as portions of our exploration costs in mexico and gabon are denominated in the local currency 
a weakening us dollar relative to the mexican peso will have the effect of increasing exploration costs while a strengthening us dollar will have the effect of reducing exploration costs 
the gabon local currency is tied to the euro 
some of our exploration activities in mexico are tied to the peso 
the exchange rates between the euro and the us dollar and between the peso and us dollar have fluctuated widely in response to international political conditions  general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control 
we seek to mitigate exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by completing a majority of our purchases in us dollars and holding a majority of our cash balances in us dollars 
the business of mineral exploration is subject to many risks there are inherent risks in the mineral exploration industry we are subject to all of the risks inherent in the minerals exploration industry including  without limitation  the following we are subject to competition from a large number of companies  many of which are significantly larger than we are  in the acquisition  exploration  and development of mining properties  we might not be able raise enough money to pay the fees and taxes and perform the labor necessary to maintain our concessions in good force  exploration for minerals is highly speculative and involves substantial risks  even when conducted on properties known to contain significant quantities of mineralization  our exploration projects may not result in the discovery of commercially mineable deposits of ore  the probability of an individual prospect ever having reserves that meet the requirements for reporting under sec industry guide is remote and any funds spent on exploration may be lost  our operations are subject to a variety of existing laws and regulations relating to exploration and development  permitting procedures  safety precautions  property reclamation  employee health and safety  air quality standards  pollution and other environmental protection controls and we may not be able to comply with these regulations and controls  and a large number of factors beyond our control  including fluctuations in metal prices  inflation  and other economic conditions  will affect the economic feasibility of mining 
metals prices are subject to extreme fluctuation 
our activities are influenced by the prices of commodities  including silver  zinc  lead  gold  and other metals 
these prices fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control  including interest rates  expectations for inflation  speculation  currency values in particular the strength of the us dollar  global and regional demand  political and economic conditions and production costs in major metal producing regions of the world 
our ability to establish reserves through our exploration activities  our future profitability and our long term viability  depend  in large part  on the market prices of silver  zinc  lead  gold  and other metals 
the market prices for these metals are volatile and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control  including global or regional consumption patterns  supply of  and demand for  silver  zinc  lead  gold  and other metals  speculative activities and producer hedging activities  expectations for inflation  political and economic conditions  and supply of  and demand for  consumables required for production 
future weakness in the global economy could increase volatility in metals prices or depress metals prices  which could in turn reduce the value of our properties  make it more difficult to raise additional capital  and make it uneconomical for us to continue our exploration activities 
there are inherent risks with foreign operations 
our business activities are primarily conducted in mexico  and we also hold interests in gabon  and as such  our activities are exposed to various levels of foreign political  economic and other risks and uncertainties 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  terrorism  hostage taking  military repression  extreme fluctuations in currency exchange rates  high rates of inflation  labor unrest  the risks of war or civil unrest  expropriation and nationalization  renegotiation or nullification of existing concessions  licenses  permits  approvals and contracts  illegal mining  changes in taxation policies  restrictions on foreign exchange and repatriation  changing political conditions  currency controls and governmental regulations that favor or require the rewarding of contracts to local contractors or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of  or purchase supplies from  a particular jurisdiction 
changes  if any  in mining or investment policies or shifts in political attitude in mexico and or gabon may adversely affect our exploration and possible future development activities 
we may also be affected in varying degrees by government regulations with respect to  but not limited to  foreign investment  maintenance of claims  environmental legislation  land use  land claims of local people  water use and mine safety 
failure to comply strictly with applicable laws  regulations and local practices relating to mineral right applications and tenure  could result in loss  reduction or expropriation of entitlements  or the imposition of additional local or foreign parties as joint venture partners with carried or other interests 
the occurrence of these various factors and uncertainties cannot be accurately predicted and could have an adverse effect on our operations 
in addition  legislation in the us  canada  mexico and or gabon regulating foreign trade  investment and taxation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
our sierra mojada project is located in mexico and is subject to various levels of political  economic  legal and other risks 
the sierra mojada project  our primary focus  is in mexico 
in the past  mexico has been subject to political instability  changes and uncertainties  which have resulted in changes to existing governmental regulations affecting mineral exploration and mining activities 
mexico s status as a developing country may make it more difficult for us to obtain any required financing for the sierra mojada project or other projects in mexico in the future 
our sierra mojada project is also subject to a variety of governmental regulations governing health and worker safety  employment standards  waste disposal  protection of historic and archaeological sites  mine development  protection of endangered and protected species and other matters 
mexican regulators have broad authority to shut down and or levy fines against facilities that do not comply with regulations or standards 
our exploration activities in mexico may be adversely affected in varying degrees by changing government regulations relating to the mining industry or shifts in political conditions that increase the costs related to the sierra mojada project 
changes  if any  in mining or investment policies or shifts in political attitude may adversely affect our financial condition 
expansion of our activities will be subject to the need to assure the availability of adequate supplies of water and power  which could be affected by government policy and competing operations in the area 
the occurrence of these various factors and uncertainties cannot be accurately predicted and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition 
future changes in applicable laws and regulations or changes in their enforcement or regulatory interpretation could negatively impact current or planned exploration activities with the sierra mojada project or in respect to any other projects in which we become involved in mexico 
any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations  even if inadvertent  could result in the interruption of exploration operations or material fines  penalties or other liabilities 
title to our properties may be challenged or defective 
our future operations  including our activities at the sierra mojada project and other exploration activities  will require additional permits from various governmental authorities 
our operations are and will continue to be governed by laws and regulations governing prospecting  mineral exploration  exports  taxes  labor standards  occupational health  waste disposal  toxic substances  land use  environmental protection  mine safety  mining royalties and other matters 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire all required licenses  permits or property rights on reasonable terms or in a timely manner  or at all  and that such terms will not be adversely changed  that required extensions will be granted  or that the issuance of such licenses  permits or property rights will not be challenged by third parties 
we attempt to confirm the validity of our rights of title to  or contract rights with respect to  each mineral property in which we have a material interest 
however  we cannot guarantee that title to our properties will not be challenged 
the sierra mojada property may be subject to prior unregistered agreements  interests or native land claims  and title may be affected by undetected defects 
there may be valid challenges to the title of any of the claims comprising the sierra mojada property that  if successful  could impair possible development and or operations with respect to such properties in the future 
challenges to permits or property rights  whether successful or unsuccessful  changes to the terms of permits or property rights  or a failure to comply with the terms of any permits or property rights that have been obtained  could have a material adverse effect on our business by delaying or preventing or making continued operations economically unfeasible 
a title defect could result in silver bull losing all or a portion of its right  title  and interest in and to the properties to which the title defect relates 
title insurance generally is not available  and our ability to ensure that we have obtained secure title to individual mineral properties or mining concessions may be severely constrained 
in addition  we may be unable to operate our properties as permitted or to enforce our rights with respect to our properties 
we annually monitor the official land records in mexico city to determine if there are annotations indicating the existence of a legal challenge against the validity of any of our concessions 
as of december  there were no such annotations  nor are we aware of any challenges from the government or from third parties 
in addition  in connection with the purchase of certain mining concessions  it appears that the prior management of silver bull agreed to pay a net royalty interest on revenue from future mineral sales on certain concessions at the sierra mojada project 
we are currently evaluating the applicability of this royalty interest  but if the royalty remains in effect and applies to concessions on which a significant portion of our mineralized material is located  the existence of the royalty may have a material effect on the economic feasibility of potential future development of sierra mojada project 
we are subject to complex environmental and other regulatory risks  which could expose us to significant liability and delay  and potentially the suspension or termination of our exploration efforts 
our mineral exploration activities are subject to federal  state and local environmental regulation in the jurisdictions where our mineral properties are located 
these regulations mandate  among other things  the maintenance of air and water quality standards and land reclamation 
they also set forth limitations on the generation  transportation  storage and disposal of solid and hazardous waste 
no assurance can be given that environmental standards imposed by these governments will not be changed  thereby possibly materially adversely affecting our proposed activities 
compliance with these environmental requirements may also necessitate significant capital outlays or may materially affect our earning power 
environmental legislation is evolving in a manner which will require stricter standards and enforcement  increased fines and penalties for non compliance  more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects  and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers  directors and employees 
as a result of recent changes in environmental laws in mexico  for example  more legal actions supported or sponsored by non governmental groups interested in halting projects may be filed against companies operating in all industrial sectors  including the mining sector 
mexican projects are also subject to the environmental agreements entered into by mexico  the united states and canada in connection with the north american free trade agreement 
future changes in environmental regulation in the jurisdictions where our projects are located may adversely affect our exploration activities  make them prohibitively expensive  or prohibit them altogether 
environmental hazards may exist on the properties in which we currently hold interests  such as the sierra mojada project  or may hold interests in the future  which are unknown to us at present and that have been caused by us or previous owners or operators  or that may have occurred naturally 
we may be liable for remediating any damage that we may have caused 
the liability could include costs for removing or remediating the release and damage to natural resources  including ground water  as well as the payment of fines and penalties 
we may face a shortage of water 
water is essential in all phases of the exploration and development of mineral properties 
it is used in such processes as exploration  drilling  leaching  placer mining  dredging  testing  and hydraulic mining 
both the lack of available water and the cost of acquisition may make an otherwise viable project economically impossible to complete 
although the work completed on the sierra mojada project thus far indicates that an adequate supply of water can probably be developed in the area for an underground mining operation  we will need to complete an additional water exploration program to determine if there is sufficient water available for an open pit mining operation 
we may face a shortage of supplies and materials 
the mineral industry has experienced from time to time shortages of certain supplies and materials necessary in the exploration for and evaluation of mineral deposits 
the prices at which such supplies and materials are available have also greatly increased 
our planned operations could be subject to delays due to such shortages and further price escalations could increase our costs for such supplies and materials 
our experience and that of others in the industry is that suppliers are often unable to meet contractual obligations for supplies  equipment  materials  and services  and that alternate sources of supply do not exist 
competition for outside engineers and consultants is fierce 
we are heavily dependent upon outside engineers and other professionals to complete work on our exploration projects 
the mining industry has experienced significant growth over the last several years and as a result  many engineering and consulting firms have experienced a shortage of qualified engineering personnel 
we closely monitor our outside consultants through regular meetings and review of resource allocations and project milestones 
however  the lack of qualified personnel combined with increased mining projects could result in delays in completing work on our exploration projects or result in higher costs to keep personnel focused on our project 
our non operating properties are subject to various hazards 
we are subject to risks and hazards  including environmental hazards  the encountering of unusual or unexpected geological formations  cave ins  flooding  earthquakes and periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions 
these occurrences could result in damage to  or destruction of  mineral properties or future production facilities  personal injury or death  environmental damage  delays in our exploration activities  asset write downs  monetary losses and possible legal liability 
we may not be insured against all losses or liabilities  either because such insurance is unavailable or because we have elected not to purchase such insurance due to high premium costs or other reasons 
although we maintain insurance in an amount that we consider to be adequate  liabilities might exceed policy limits  in which event we could incur significant costs that could adversely affect our activities 
the realization of any significant liabilities in connection with our activities as described above could negatively affect our activities and the price of our common stock 
we need and rely upon key personnel 
presently  we employ a limited number of full time employees  utilize outside consultants  and in large part rely on the personal efforts of our officers and directors 
our success will depend  in part  upon the ability to attract and retain qualified employees 
we believe that we will be able to attract competent employees and consultants  but no assurance can be given that we will be successful in this regard 
if we are unable to engage and retain the necessary personnel  our business would be materially and adversely affected 
competition for these professionals is extremely intense 
risks relating to our common stock no dividends are anticipated 
at the present time we do not anticipate paying dividends  cash or otherwise  on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
future dividends will depend on our earnings  if any  our financial requirements and other factors 
there can be no assurance that we will pay dividends 
our stock price can be extremely volatile 
our common stock is listed on the tsx and nyse amex 
the trading price of our common stock has been and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to announcements of our business developments  results and progress of our exploration activities at the sierra mojada project and in gabon  progress reports on our exploration activities  and other events or factors 
in addition  stock markets have experienced extreme price volatility in recent years 
this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of companies  at times for reasons unrelated to their operating performance 
these fluctuations could be in response to volatility in metal prices  political developments in the foreign countries in which our properties  or properties for which we perform services  are located  and news reports relating to trends in our industry or general economic conditions 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our stock  regardless of our operating performance 
we cannot make any predictions or projections as to what the prevailing market price for our common stock will be at any time  including as to whether our common stock will sustain market prices at or near the offering price  or as to what effect the sale of shares or the availability of common stock for sale at any time will have on the prevailing market price 
further equity financings may lead to the dilution of our common stock 
in order to finance future operations  we may raise funds through the issuance of common stock or the issuance of debt instruments or other securities convertible into common stock 
we cannot predict the size of future issuances of common stock or the size and terms of future issuances of debt instruments or other securities convertible into common stock or the effect  if any  that future issuances and sales of our securities will have on the market price of our common stock 
any transaction involving the issuance of previously authorized but unissued shares  or securities convertible into common stock  would result in dilution  possibly substantial  to present and prospective security holders

throughout this document we make statements that are classified as forward looking 
see cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements 
business overview silver bull  incorporated in nevada  is an exploration stage company  engaged in the business of mineral exploration 
our primary objective is to define sufficient mineral reserves on the sierra mojada property to justify the development of a mechanized mining operation the sierra mojada project 
we conduct our operations in mexico through our wholly owned mexican subsidiaries  minera metalin sa de sa minera and contratistas de sierra mojada sa de sa contratistas 
however  as noted above  we have not established any reserves at the sierra mojada property  and are in the exploration stage and may never enter the development or production stage 
on april   we completed a merger transaction with dome ventures corporation dome  whereby dome became our wholly owned subsidiary 
dome through its subsidiaries holds three exploration licenses in gabon  west africa covering approximately  square kilometers and has entered into a joint venture agreement with a subsidiary of anglogold ashanti limited anglogold on two of its licenses  ndjole and mevang 
dome also entered into a second joint venture agreement on the ogooue license held by anglogold 
dome s third license  the mitzic license  has iron ore potential and we are currently looking for a joint venture partner on this license 
operations in gabon are conducted by dome s subsidiaries dome ventures sarl gabon and african resources sarl gabon 
our principal offices are located at west georgia street  suite  vancouver  bc  canada vc e  and our telephone number is current year developments sierra mojada property in january  our board of directors approved a calendar year exploration budget of million for the sierra mojada property subject to us raising additional capital during the first half of calendar year to fully fund these exploration activities 
as a result of closing a private placement with coeur d alene mines corporation coeur on june  for net proceeds of approximately million  we revised the exploration budget to million for the sierra mojada project 
this million increase was completely for drilling and related costs 
the exploration program at the sierra mojada property was designed to build on the drilling activities of the aim of the program was to further define and extend the shallow silver zone 
the shallow silver zone is an oxide silver zone zinc and lead  hosted along an east west trending fracture karst system set in a cretaceous limestone dolomite sequence 
at depth  the shallow silver zone appears to merge with the zinc zone to form a continuous mineralized body over kilometers in length 
the different mobility characteristics of the metals in a low temperature oxide environment has resulted in a crude zonation of the mineralized body creating a silver rich zone the shallow silver zone and a zinc rich zone the red zinc zone 
mineralized material estimate on november   srk consulting canada inc srk delivered a technical report on the silver mineralization in the shallow silver zone of the sierra mojada project in accordance with the canadian securities administrators national instrument standards of disclosure for mineral projects ni 
the resource was estimated from  diamond drill holes  reverse circulation drill holes   channel samples and  long holes 
in total  these contain  assay records  of which  records contain silver and zinc assays values 
at an economic cutoff grade of grams tonne of silver for mineralized material possibly accessible by open pit mining and grams tonne of silver for mineralized material possibly amendable to underground mining  the report indicates mineralized material of million tonnes at an average silver grade of grams tonne for the silver pit and million tonnes at an average silver grade of grams tonne for the underground workings 
mineralized material estimates do not include any amounts categorized as inferred resources 
mineralized material as used in this annual report on form k  although permissible under sec s guide  does not indicate reserves by sec standards 
we cannot be certain that any part of the sierra mojada project will ever be confirmed or converted into sec industry guide compliant reserves 
investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of the mineralized material will ever be confirmed or converted into reserves or that mineralized material can be economically or legally extracted 
drilling during the calendar year we drilled approximately  meters at the sierra mojada property which was focused on drilling and further defining the shallow silver zone 
this drilling was very successful in defining a near surface oxide silver zinc lead zone of mineralization that is at least three kilometers long  averages about meters wide and about meters thick 
it can be seen at surface in the western half of the resource area  before dipping at around degrees at the eastern end of the mineralized body 
at present  the very eastern edge of the mineralization defined so far lies under about meters of alluvial cover 
the entire kilometer strike length of the resource appears to be amenable to mining by open pit methods 
additionally  a new zone of silver mineralization named the centenario zone was identified 
the centenario zone is hosted along the centenario fault  a buried east west trending structure which lies meters to the north of  and runs parallel to  the sierra mojada fault which hosts the shallow silver zone 
as discussed in the material changes in financial condition  liquidity and capital resources section below we have approved an exploration budget of million for calendar this exploration program includes a planned  meter drilling program targeting the centenario zone and the western extension of the shallow silver zone 
additionally  this program includes a planned  meter underground drilling program targeting along the kilometer parrena adit which lies immediately south of the shallow silver zone 
the parrena adit has not been previously drilled 
geological mapping in addition to drilling the extensions on the shallow silver zone  a regional mapping and prospecting exploration program focused on the palamos negros  dormidos  and san francisco prospects is underway 
the aim of this program is to identify drill targets in these prospects outside of the shallow silver zone 
during the second half of holes totaling just over  meters were drilled at the san francisco prospect 
due to resulted being below expectations management is reevaluating further work to be taken in relation to the san francisco prospect 
airborne geophysics a  line kilometer ztem airborne geophysics survey was completed in march of by geotech ltd 
a company based in ontario  canada 
the survey was increased from the original  line kilometer plan to ensure complete coverage of several magnetic anomalies previously identified 
ken witherly of condor consulting  inc  based out of denver  colorado provided qa qc on the data 
the aim of this work is to help better define potential drill targets within the wider sierra mojada area 
the results identified a number of buried structures and better outlined several lithological units in the area 
gabon property to date  three main coherent gold anomalies above parts per billion ppb and over km in length and up to km wide and several smaller anomalous zones up to km in length and up to km wide have been identified 
background gold values in the region are less than ppb and results above ppb are considered anomalous 
over of the results received to date are above ppb with peak values in excess of  ppb in the soils 
the anomalies appear to have strong structural controls concentrating along mapped or inferred lithological contacts  structural breaks  and fold hinges 
there is also a strong spatial relationship of the gold anomalies to a thick graphitic lithological unit in the area that is thought to represent an ideal lithological trap for mineralizing fluids 
initial prospecting in these anomalous zones has identified a number of gold bearing quartz veins  many of which run between g t to g t gold 
exploratory drilling has focused on these gold anomalies 
east west trending drill fences have been positioned to test roughly north south trending lithological contacts which are considered as the most favorable sites for gold deposition 
a total of  meters was drilled with gold intercepts between m to m in thickness encountered 
the best intercept averaged g t gold over meters 
most intercepts were in the meter to meter range at to g t gold 
anomalous silver and manganese were also encountered in some holes 
airborne geophysics a  line kilometer vtem geophysics survey was completed by spectrem air ltd over the ndjole exploration permit in march results show a strong electro magnetic response that has been strongly folded and deformed 
mapping mapping of the main gold prospects was completed in the ndjole and mevang licences at  scale 
detailed mapping at scale occurred over areas with drilling to better define lithological contacts and local structure 
a large soil sampling and mapping campaign lead by anglogold targeting the extensions to the known geology is currently underway on the property and will continue into management changes during  we made significant additional changes in our management and board of directors on february   dr 
nicole adshead bell was appointed to the board of directors as an independent director 
dr 
adshead bell is a geologist with a significant amount of experience in the investment banking and financial analysis industries where her primary emphasis has been on mid sized and junior level natural resources companies 
on march   tim barry previously our vice president of exploration was appointed chief executive officer  president and director  replacing gregory hahn who had been serving as interim chief executive officer since july mr 
barry has over years of exploration and management experience 
he has worked as a consulting geologist on projects in canada  mexico  australia  new zealand  mongolia and west africa and has significant experience with silver bull s field operations in africa 
on april   sean fallis previously our vice president of finance was appointed chief financial officer  replacing robert devers who had been serving as chief financial officer 
mr 
fallis is a chartered accountant and was formerly the corporate controller of gold producer rusoro mining ltd 
prior to rusoro mining ltd 
mr 
fallis worked with canadian and united states publically listed companies in the audit and assurance practice of pricewaterhousecoopers where mr 
fallis focused on clients in the mining industry 
on april   daniel kunz was appointed to the board of directors

mr 
kunz has held positions in ivanhoe mines president  mk gold company president ceo and morrison knudsen corporation vice president and controller  and as cfo to the mining group 
on april   greg hahn  wesley pomeroy and robert kramer ceased serving as directors 
on august   we entered into an independent contractor agreement with jason cunliffe  as the newly appointed vice president of exploration 
results of operations upon the closing of the merger on april   dome became our wholly owned subsidiary 
the financial results from dome are included in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss income and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended october  however  because the merger with dome did not close until april  dome s financial results are only included in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss income and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended october   for the period from april  to october  for the fiscal year ended october   we experienced a consolidated net loss of  or approximately per share  compared to a consolidated net loss of  or approximately per share during the fiscal year ended october  the  increase in the consolidated net loss was primarily due to a  increase in exploration and property holding costs in the fiscal year from the fiscal year and a foreign currency translation loss of  in the fiscal year compared to a foreign currency translation gain of  in the fiscal year 
this was partially offset by a  decrease in general and administrative expenses in the fiscal year from the fiscal year 
exploration and property holding costs exploration and property holding costs increased  to  in the fiscal year from  in the fiscal year primarily due to a significantly expanded exploration program on the sierra mojada property as cash constraints limited the amount of exploration activities in the portion of fiscal year prior to the merger previously discussed 
general and administrative costs general and administrative expenses decreased  to  in the fiscal year from  in the fiscal year as described below 
stock based compensation was a significant factor for the fluctuations in personnel and directors fees 
overall stock based compensation included in general and administrative expenses increased to  in the fiscal year from  in the fiscal year 
personnel costs decreased  to  in the fiscal year from  in the fiscal year 
this decrease was primarily due to  of severance expense in the fiscal year due to change in control provisions in the employment agreements of three former executives 
this expense was offset by higher stock based compensation  which increased to  in the fiscal year from  in the fiscal year 
stock based compensation increased due to the issuance of stock options to the new members of management in the fiscal year 
also  we entered into a severance agreement in the fiscal year with our former chief financial officer robert devers whereby he received severance payments totaling approximately  which was paid in april office and administrative expenses of  in the fiscal year was comparable to  in the fiscal year 
significant costs in office and administrative include shareholder relations  costs of maintaining our corporate office and listing and exchange fees 
professional fees decreased  to  in the fiscal year from  in the fiscal year 
the decrease relates to additional legal and accounting costs incurred in the prior year as a result of the dome merger and the application for listing on the toronto stock exchange offset by additional costs in the current year associated with the dual listings on the nyse amex and toronto stock exchange 
directors fees decreased  to  in the fiscal year from  in the fiscal year 
this decrease was primarily due to a  decrease in stock based compensation to  in the fiscal year from  in the fiscal year as a result of stock options granted to new directors and the pro rata stock based compensation of stock options previously granted in august we recorded a provision of  in the fiscal year for uncollectible value added taxes compared to a provision of  in the fiscal year 
the allowance for uncollectible taxes was estimated by management based upon a number of factors including the length of time the returns have been outstanding  general economic conditions in mexico and estimated net recovery after commissions 
other income expense we recorded other expense of  in the fiscal year compared to other income of  in the fiscal year 
this was mainly the result of a foreign currency translation loss of  in the fiscal year compared to a foreign currency translation gain of  in the fiscal year 
these foreign currency translation gains and losses are primarily due to the impact of the change in exchange rate between the us dollar and mexican peso and the resulting impact on the intercompany loans between silver bull and our mexican subsidiaries 
material changes in financial condition  liquidity and capital resources cash flows during the fiscal year we primarily utilized cash and cash on hand and proceeds from issuances of common stock to fund exploration activities at the sierra mojada property including property concession option purchase agreement payments and for general and administrative expenses 
during this period  we received  in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock through a private placement to coeur and through the exercise of stock options and warrants 
as a result of exploration activities and general and administrative expenses offset by the financing obtained through equity transactions  cash and cash equivalents decreased from  at october  to  at october  cash flows used in operations for the fiscal year was  as compared to  for the comparable period in this increase was mainly due to the significantly higher exploration costs at the sierra mojada property and increased value added tax receivable payments which were partially offset by reduced general and administrative expenses excluding stock based compensation as discussed in the results of operations section above 
cash flows used in investing activities for the fiscal year was  as compared to  in cash flows provided by operations for the fiscal year 
during the fiscal year we sold equipment for  purchased equipment for  and spent  on the acquisition of property concessions as compared to sales of equipment of  purchases of equipment for  and payments of  for the acquisition of property concessions in the fiscal year 
the cash outflow for the fiscal year was offset by cash acquired in the merger of  equipment purchases decreased and equipment sales increased in the fiscal year as we are using external contractors for a greater portion of the drilling work on the sierra mojada property and acquisition of property concessions increased due to the execution of additional concession option purchase agreements and the escalating payment nature of the agreements 
cash flows provided by financing activities for the fiscal year was  as compared to  for the fiscal year 
the significant decrease in cash flows is due to the  of proceeds from the issuance of common stock including common stock issued related to the dome transaction during the fiscal year offset by net proceeds of  for the private placement with coeur completed in the fiscal year 
capital resources as of october   we had cash and cash equivalents of  and working capital of  as compared to cash and cash equivalents of  and working capital of  as of october  the decrease in our liquidity and working capital were primarily the result of cash used by operating and investing activities including exploration work and acquisition of additional concessions which were partially offset by proceeds received from financing activities including the issuance of common stock and proceeds received on the exercise of warrants 
the accounts payable and accrued liabilities at october  increased as a result of the additional exploration work on the sierra mojada property and timing of payments 
since inception  we have relied primarily upon proceeds from private placements and registered direct offerings of our equity securities and warrant exercises as our primary sources of financing to fund our operations 
we anticipate that we will continue to rely on sales of our securities in order to continue to fund our business operations 
issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing stockholders 
there is no assurance that we will be able to complete any additional sales of our equity securities or that we will be able arrange for other financing to fund our planned business activities 
moreover  as a result of a late form k filing in  we may not be eligible to use our shelf registration statement during the majority of in that event  our ability to quickly access us capital markets will be somewhat constrained 
if we are unable to fund future operations by way of financing  including public or private offerings of equity or debt securities  our business  financial condition and exploration activities will be adversely impacted 
december offering during december we closed registered direct offerings for the sale or  shares of common stock at a price of per share for gross proceeds of  we paid a finder s fee totaling  to a canadian finder with respect to certain non us purchasers who were introduced by them 
capital requirements and liquidity  need for subsequent funding our management and board of directors monitor our overall costs  expenses  and financial resources and  if necessary  will adjust our planned operational expenditures in an attempt to ensure we have sufficient operating capital 
we continue to evaluate our costs and planned expenditures including for our sierra mojada property 
the continued exploration of the sierra mojada property will require significant amounts of additional capital 
in january  the board of directors approved a calendar year exploration budget of million for the sierra mojada property and a million budget for general and administrative expenses 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash on hand  and therefore we anticipate that we will need to raise additional capital to fully fund the calendar exploration program at the sierra mojada property and for general and administrative expenses 
during calendar year we will continue to evaluate our ability to raise additional capital and we will reduce expenditures on the sierra mojada property if we determine that additional capital is unavailable or available on terms that we determine are unacceptable 
also  the continued exploration of the sierra mojada property ultimately will require us to raise additional capital  identify other sources of funding  or identify another strategic transaction 
the on going uncertainty and volatility in the global financial and capital markets have limited the availability of funding 
debt or equity financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
equity financing  if available  may result in substantial dilution to existing stockholders 
if we are unable to fund future operations by way of financing  including public or private offerings of equity or debt securities  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be adversely impacted

we evaluate our policies and estimates on an on going basis and discuss the development  selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and as such requires the use of judgment 
our consolidated financial statements may differ based upon different estimates and assumptions 
we discuss our significant accounting policies in note summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are subject to judgments and uncertainties that affect the application of such policies 
we believe these consolidated financial statements include the most likely outcomes with regard to amounts that are based on our judgment and estimates 
our consolidated financial position and results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from the actual amounts  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements due to the estimation process and business judgment involved in their application use of estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates based on assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes to the consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant under the circumstances 
revisions to estimates and assumptions are accounted for prospectively 
significant areas involving the use of estimates include determining the allowance for uncollectible taxes  evaluating recoverability of mineral concessions  evaluating impairment of long lived assets  evaluating impairment of goodwill  establishing a valuation allowance on future use of deferred tax assets  determining the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in the merger with dome and calculating stock based compensation 
property concessions costs of acquiring property concessions are capitalized by project area upon purchase or staking of the associated claims 
costs to maintain the mineral rights and leases are expensed as incurred 
when a property reaches the production stage  the related capitalized costs will be amortized  using the units of production method on the basis of periodic estimates of ore reserves 
to date  no mineral concessions have reached the production stage 
we review and evaluate our property concessions for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable and any impairment in carrying value is charged to operations at the time of impairment 
should a concession be abandoned  its capitalized costs are charged to operations 
we charge to operations the allocable portion of capitalized costs attributable to concessions sold 
capitalized costs are allocated to concessions abandoned or sold based on the proportion of claims abandoned or sold to the claims remaining within the project area 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  comprised of property and equipment subject to amortization  are assessed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
for the purpose of impairment testing  long lived assets are grouped and tested for recoverability at the lowest level that generates independent cash flows from another asset group 
in testing the recoverability of the assets  the carrying value of the assets or asset groups is compared to the fair value of the assets or asset groups 
an impairment loss is recognized as the excess of the carrying value over the fair value when an asset or asset group is not recoverable 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess  at the date of acquisition  of the purchase price of the business acquired over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
when multiple reporting units are acquired in one business combination  goodwill is allocated to reporting units as of the date of the business combination  by determining estimates of the fair value of each reporting unit and comparing this amount to the fair values of assets and liabilities in the reporting unit 
goodwill is not amortized 
we perform goodwill annual impairment tests at april each fiscal year and when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may no longer be recoverable 
goodwill is assessed at the reporting unit level 
in performing the impairment tests  we estimate the fair values of our reporting units that include goodwill and compares those fair values to the reporting units carrying amounts 
if a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the carrying amount  and any excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over the implied fair value is charged to earnings 
income taxes we follow the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the tax basis and accounting basis of the assets and liabilities measured using tax rates enacted at the balance sheet date 
we recognize the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is at least more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the taxing authorities 
this accounting standard also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods and disclosure 
a valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if management does not believe we have met the more likely than not standard imposed by this guidance to allow recognition of such an asset 
management recorded a full valuation allowance at october  and october  against the deferred tax assets as it deems future realization would not meet the criteria more likely than not 
stock based compensation and warrants we use the black scholes pricing model as a method for determining the estimated fair value for all stock options awarded to employees  officers  directors and consultants 
the expected term of the options is based upon evaluation of historical and expected future exercise behavior 
the risk free interest rate is based upon us treasury rates at the date of grant with maturity dates approximately equal to the expected life of the grant 
volatility is determined upon historical volatility of our stock and adjusted if future volatility is expected to vary from historical experience 
we have not historically issued any dividends and we do not expect to in the future 
we use the graded vesting attribution method to recognize compensation costs over the requisite service period 
we also used the black scholes valuation model to determine the fair market value of warrants 
expected volatility is based upon weighted average of historical volatility over the contractual term of the warrant and implied volatility 
the risk free interest rate is based upon implied yield on a us treasury zero coupon issue with a remaining term equal to the contractual term of the option 
the dividend yield is assumed to be none as we have not paid dividends nor do we anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future 
foreign currency translation assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars at the year end exchange rates  and revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period 
exchange differences arising on translation are disclosed as a separate component of stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are reflected in the results of operations 
during the year ended october   intercompany transactions and balances with our mexican and gabonese subsidiaries were considered to be short term in nature and accordingly all foreign currency transaction gains and losses on intercompany loans are included in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss income during the year ended october  on july   we acknowledged our intention to convert certain intercompany loans totaling million to equity 
subsequent to july   we no longer recognize foreign currency transaction gains or losses on this million portion of intercompany loans in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss income 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we hold substantially all of our cash and cash equivalents in bank and demand deposit accounts with major financial institutions 
the interest rates received on these balances may fluctuate with changes in economic conditions 
based on the average cash and cash equivalent and restricted cash balances during the year ended october   a decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a reduction in interest income for the period of approximately  foreign currency exchange risk certain purchases of labor  operating supplies and capital assets are denominated in canadian dollars cdn  mexican pesos  central african francs cfa or other currencies 
as a result  currency exchange fluctuations may impact the costs of our operations 
specifically  the appreciation of the mexican peso  cdn or cfa against the us dollar may result in an increase in operating expenses and capital costs in us dollar terms 
to reduce this risk as of october   we maintain minimum cash balances in cfa and mexican pesos 
as of october   we maintained the majority of our cash balance in cdn 
subsequent to the registered direct offerings in december we maintain the majority of cash balances in us dollars 
we currently do not engage in any currency hedging activities 
commodity price risk our primary business activity is the exploration of properties containing silver  zinc  lead and other minerals 
as a result  decreases in the price of any of these metals have the potential to negatively impact our ability to establish reserves and develop our exploration properties 
none of our properties are in production and we do not currently hold any commodity derivative positions
