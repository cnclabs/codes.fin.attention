item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive overview first community bancshares  inc is a financial holding company that  through its bank subsidiary  provides commercial banking services and has positioned itself as a regional community bank and a financial services alternative to larger banks which often provide less emphasis on personal relationships  and smaller community banks which lack the capital and resources to efficiently serve customer needs 
the company has focused its growth efforts on building financial partnerships and more enduring and complete relationships with businesses and individuals through a very personal and local approach to banking and financial services 
the company and its operations are guided by a strategic plan which includes growth through acquisitions and through office expansion in market areas including virginia  west virginia  north carolina  south carolina  and tennessee 
while the company s mission remains that of a community bank  management believes that entry into new markets will accelerate the company s growth rate by diversifying the demographics of its customer base and customer prospects and by generally increasing its sales and service network 
economy the local economies in which the company operates are diverse and span a four state region 
the economies of west virginia and southwest virginia have significant exposure to extractive industries  such as coal  timber and natural gas 
the local economies in the central portion of north carolina have suffered in recent years due to foreign competition in both furniture and textiles  as well as consolidation in the financial services industry 
despite these detractions  the economies in this region continue to benefit from national companies operating in the triad and central piedmont area of north carolina 
the eastern virginia local economies have  in recent years  benefited from key corporate and government activities 
the economy in eastern tennessee continues to benefit from the stability of higher education  healthcare services and tourism 
despite the stable and positive aspects of the regional economies in which the company primarily operates  the company s markets have experienced significant declines in residential development and construction  not inconsistent with national trends 
these declines have led to contraction in residential land development and construction  which has historically been important components of the company s lending activities 
the economies of the company s southwest virginia and west virginia markets have remained stable compared with the national economy and unemployment levels were generally lower than the national average at december  competition as the company competes for increased market share and growth in both loans and deposits  it continues to encounter strong competition from many sources 
many of the markets targeted by the company are also being entered by other banks in nearby and distant markets 
the expansion of banks  credit unions  and other non depository financial companies over recent years has intensified competitive pressures on core deposit generation and retention 
competitive forces impact the company through pressure on interest yields  product fees  and loan structure and terms  however  the company has countered these pressures with its relationship style of banking  competitive pricing  cost efficiencies  and a disciplined approach to loan underwriting 
application of critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
the company s financial position and results of operations are affected by management s application of accounting policies  including judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in the company s consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations 
estimates  assumptions  and judgments are necessary principally when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at estimated fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded based upon the probability of occurrence of a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by third party sources  when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated by management primarily through the use of financial modeling techniques and appraisal estimates 
the company s accounting policies are fundamental to understanding management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following is a summary of the company s more subjective and complex critical 
table of contents accounting policies 
in addition  the disclosures presented in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified investment valuation  determination of the allowance for loan losses  accounting for acquisitions and intangible assets  and accounting for income taxes as the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments 
investment securities management performs an extensive review of the investment securities portfolio quarterly to determine the cause of declines in the fair value of each security within each segment of the portfolio 
the company uses inputs provided by an independent third party to determine the fair values of its investment securities portfolio 
inputs provided by the third party are reviewed and corroborated by management 
evaluations of the causes of the unrealized losses are performed to determine whether the impairment is temporary or other than temporary in nature 
considerations such as the company s intent and ability to hold the securities  recoverability of the invested amounts over the company s intended holding period  severity in pricing decline  credit rating  and receipt of amounts contractually due  among other factors  are applied in determining whether a security is other than temporarily impaired 
if a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary  the value of the security is reduced and a corresponding charge to earnings is recognized 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level management deems sufficient to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio  and is based on management s evaluation of the risks in the loan portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of loan activity 
the company consistently applies a review process to periodically evaluate loans for changes in credit risk 
this process serves as the primary means by which the company evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the company determines the allowance for loan losses by making specific allocations to impaired loans that exhibit inherent weaknesses and various credit risk and by general allocations to commercial  residential real estate  and consumer loans by giving weight to risk ratings  historical loss trends and management s judgment concerning those trends  and other relevant factors 
these factors may include  but are not limited to  actual versus estimated losses  regional and national economic conditions  business segment and portfolio concentrations  industry competition and consolidation  and the impact of government regulations 
the foregoing analysis is performed by management to evaluate the portfolio and calculate an estimated valuation allowance through a quantitative and qualitative analysis that applies risk factors to those identified risk areas 
this risk management evaluation is applied at both the portfolio level and the individual loan level for commercial loans and credit relationships while the level of consumer and residential mortgage loan allowance is determined primarily on a total portfolio level based on a review of historical loss percentages and other qualitative factors including concentrations  industry specific factors and economic conditions 
the commercial portfolio requires more specific analysis of individually significant loans and the borrower s underlying cash flow  business conditions  capacity for debt repayment and the valuation of secondary sources of payment  such as collateral 
this analysis may result in specifically identified weaknesses and corresponding specific impairment allowances 
while allocations are made to specific loans and classifications within the various categories of loans  the allowance for loan losses is available for all loan losses 
the use of various estimates and judgments in the company s ongoing evaluation of the required level of allowance can significantly impact the company s results of operations and financial condition and may result in either greater provisions against earnings to increase the allowance or reduced provisions based upon management s current view of the portfolio and economic conditions and the application of revised estimates and assumptions 
differences between actual loan loss experience and estimates are reflected through adjustments that are made by increasing or decreasing the loan loss provision based upon current measurement criteria 
acquisitions and intangible assets the company may  from time to time  engage in business combinations with other companies 
purchase accounting requires the recording of underlying assets and liabilities of the entity acquired at their fair market value 
any excess of the purchase price of the business over the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
in instances where the price of the acquired business is less than the net assets acquired  a gain on purchase is recorded 
fair values are assigned based on quoted prices for similar assets  if readily available  or appraisal by qualified independent parties for relevant asset and liability categories 
financial assets and liabilities are typically valued using discount models which apply current discount rates to streams of cash flow 
all of these valuation methods require the use of assumptions which can result in alternate valuations and varying levels of goodwill and amounts of bargain purchase gain and  in some cases  amortization expense or accretion income 

table of contents management must also make estimates of useful or economic lives of certain acquired assets and liabilities 
these lives are used in establishing amortization and accretion of some intangible assets and liabilities  such as the intangible associated with core deposits acquired in the acquisition of a commercial bank 
goodwill is recorded as the excess of the purchase price  if any  over the fair value of the acquired net assets 
goodwill is tested annually in the fourth quarter for possible impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its book value  including goodwill step 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its book value  no goodwill impairment exists 
however  if the book value of the reporting unit is greater than its determined fair value  goodwill impairment may exist and further testing is required to determine the amount  if any  of the actual impairment loss step 
the step test utilizes a combination of two methods to determine the fair value of the reporting units 
for both reporting units  a discounted cash flow model is created projecting cash flows from operations of the business reporting unit  the results of which are weighted 
for the banking reporting unit a market multiple model utilizes price to net income and price to tangible book value inputs for closed transactions and for certain common sized institutions and the results are weighted 
for the insurance reporting unit the market multiple model primarily utilizes price to sales for closed transactions and certain similar industry public companies and the results are weighted 
the end results for both reporting units are then compared to the respective book values to consider if impairment is evident 
to determine the overall reasonableness of the reporting unit computations  the combined computed fair value is then compared to the overall market capitalization of the consolidated company to determine the level of implied control premium 
the discounted cash flow analysis uses estimates in the form of growth and attrition rates  anticipated rates of return  and discount rates 
these estimates have a direct bearing on the results of the impairment testing and serve as the basis for management s conclusions as to potential impairment 
the results of the step analysis performed during the fourth quarter of determined that no impairment was evident for the banking reporting unit 
for the insurance reporting unit the step analysis indicated impairment 
a step analysis was performed for the insurance reporting unit resulting in impairment to goodwill of million 
an adjustment to the weighting of the results  a decline in the market multiples used  further decline in the banking and retail insurance industry valuations  or further decline in our common stock price could result in future potential impairment 
income taxes the establishment of provisions for federal and state income taxes is a complex area of accounting which also involves the use of judgments and estimates in applying relevant tax statutes 
the company operates in multiple state tax jurisdictions and this requires the appropriate allocation of income and expense to each state based on a variety of apportionment or allocation bases 
the company is also subject to audit by federal and state tax authorities 
results of these audits may produce indicated liabilities which differ from company estimates and provisions 
the company continually evaluates its exposure to possible tax assessments arising from audits and records its estimate of possible exposure based on current facts and circumstances 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of differing carrying values of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement purposes that will reverse in future periods 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled 
as changes in tax laws or rates are enacted  deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes 
when uncertainty exists concerning the recoverability of a deferred tax asset  the carrying value of the asset may be reduced by a valuation allowance 
the amount of any valuation allowance established is based upon an estimate of the deferred tax asset that is more likely than not to be recovered 
increases or decreases in the valuation allowance result in increases or decreases to the provision for income taxes 
recent acquisitions and divestitures in july  the company acquired tristone community bank tristone  based in winston salem  north carolina 
tristone had two full service locations in winston salem  north carolina 
at acquisition  tristone had total assets of million  total loans of million and total deposits of million

occupancy  furniture  and equipment expenses decreased thousand in to million  as compared to million in  due to branch closings and insurance agency sales 
fdic premiums and assessments totaled million in  a decrease of thousand compared to the decrease is attributed to modifications in the fdic s assessment methodology in april that changed the assessment base for deposit insurance premiums from one based on domestic deposits to one based on average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity

also included in other operating expenses was a thousand increase in losses and other expenses related to foreclosed properties  which was million in compared to million in as of december   the company recognized a goodwill impairment of million in the insurance reporting unit 
despite strong operating performance and positive market experience in sales of the company s non core agencies  market multiples and other valuation indicators remain depressed resulting in a lower valuation of the insurance segment 
the company uses an efficiency ratio that is a non gaap financial measure of operating expense control and efficiency of operations 
management believes this ratio better focuses attention on the core operating performance of the company over time than does a gaap based ratio  and is highly useful in comparing period to period operating performance of the company s core business operations 
it is used by management as part of its assessment of its performance in managing noninterest expenses 
however  this measure is supplemental and is not a substitute for an analysis of performance based on gaap measures 
the efficiency ratio used by the company may not be comparable to efficiency ratios reported by other financial institutions 
in general  the efficiency ratio used by the company is noninterest expenses as a percentage of net interest income plus noninterest income 
noninterest expenses used in the calculation exclude nonrecurring expenses 
income for the ratio is increased for the favorable effect of tax exempt income see average balance sheets and net interest income analysis  and excludes securities gains and losses  which vary widely from period to period without appreciably affecting operating expenses  nonrecurring gains and losses  and otti charges 
the measure is different from the gaap based efficiency ratio  which also is presented in this report  which is calculated using noninterest expense and income amounts as shown on the face of the consolidated statements of income 
both types of efficiency ratio calculations are set forth and are reconciled in the table below 

table of contents the non gaap efficiency ratios for continuing operations for   and were   and  respectively

income taxes as a percentage of pre tax income may vary significantly from statutory rates due to items of income and expense which are excluded  by law  from the calculation of taxable income 
these items are commonly referred to as permanent differences 
the most significant permanent differences for the company include income on municipal securities which are exempt from federal income tax  certain dividend payments which are deductible by the company  and the increases in the cash surrender values of life insurance policies 
consolidated income taxes for were million compared to income taxes of million in for the years ended december  and  the effective tax expense rates were and  respectively 
the increase in the effective rate can be attributed to a reduction in the impact of both tax exempt income and state income taxes combined with a reduction in income tax expense necessary to reconcile the company s reported tax expense with the actual expense as presented in the company s tax return filed with the internal revenue service and state taxation authorities

allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is increased by charges to earnings in the form of provisions and recoveries of prior loan charge offs and decreased by loan charge offs 
the provision is calculated to bring the allowance to a level which  according to a systematic process of measurement  reflects the amount management estimates is needed to absorb probable losses within the portfolio 
additional information regarding the determination of the allowance for loan losses can be found in note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item herein 

table of contents the company s allowance for loan losses was million at december   compared to million at december   a decrease of thousand 
the decrease in the allowance for loan losses was influenced by net charge off activity during the year  which totaled million as of december   as compared to million as of december  the company determines the allowance for loan losses by making specific allocations to impaired loans that exhibit inherent weaknesses and various credit risk and general allocations to commercial loans  consumer residential real estate  and consumer loans by giving weight to risk ratings  historical loss trends and management s judgment concerning those trends  and other relevant factors 
the general allocations are determined through a methodology that utilizes a rolling five year average loss history that is adjusted for current qualitative or environmental factors that management deems likely to cause estimated credit losses as of the evaluation date to differ from the historical loss experience 
management considers the allowance adequate based upon its analysis of the portfolio as of december   however  no assurance can be made that additions to the allowance for loan losses will not be required in future periods

non performing assets increased during as the broad economy and borrowers continued to suffer through slow growth economic conditions 
at december   there were no significant potential problem loans beyond those addressed in the preceding table 
non accrual loans increased million to million at december   compared to million at december  the majority of the increase in non accrual loans can be attributed to a million increase in the single family owner occupied loan class and a million increase in the non farm  non residential loan class 
these increases were offset by a million decrease in the multi family residential loan class and a thousand decrease in the single family non owner occupied loan class 
non accrual loans at december   were primarily comprised of single family owner occupied loan class  non farm  non residential loan class  and commercial and industrial loan class 
approximately million  or  of non accrual loans can be attributed to the tristone loan portfolio that was acquired during the third quarter of certain loans included in the non accrual category have been written down to the estimated realizable value or have been assigned specific reserves within the allowance for loan losses based upon management s estimate of loss upon ultimate resolution

the company has considered all loans determined to be impaired in the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses at december  the company s provision for loan losses and the allowance for loan losses remained elevated during due to the weakness in the real estate market and the weak economic conditions experienced during the year 
as a result of the elevated levels of charge offs and in light of the broader economy  the company deemed it appropriate to maintain an elevated level of qualitative factors that adjust upward the historical loss rates in its allowance model 
the company maintains an active and robust problem credit identification system 
when a credit is identified as exhibiting characteristics of weakening  the company will assess the credit for potential impairment 
examples of weakening include delinquency and deterioration of the borrower s capacity to repay as determined by our ongoing credit review function 
as part of the impairment review  the company evaluates the current collateral value 
it is the company s standard practice to obtain updated third party collateral valuations to assist management in measuring potential impairment of a credit and the amount of the impairment to be recorded  if any 
internal collateral valuations are generally performed within two to four weeks of the original identification of potential impairment and receipt of the third party valuation 
the internal valuation is performed by comparing the original appraisal to current local real estate market conditions and experience and considers expected liquidation costs 
the result of the internal valuation is compared to the outstanding loan balance  and  if warranted  a specific impairment reserve will be established at the completion of the internal evaluation 
a third party evaluation is typically received within thirty to forty five days of the completion of the internal evaluation 
once received  the third party evaluation is reviewed for reasonableness 
once the evaluation is reviewed and accepted  discounts to fair market value are applied based upon such factors as the bank s historical liquidation experience of like collateral  and an estimated net realizable value is established 
that estimated net realizable value is then compared to the outstanding loan balance to determine the amount of specific impairment reserve 
the specific impairment reserve  if necessary  is adjusted to reflect the results of the updated evaluation 
a specific impairment reserve is generally maintained on impaired loans during the period while awaiting receipt of the third party evaluation  as well as on impaired loans that continue to make some form of payment where liquidation is not imminent 
impaired loans not meeting the aforementioned criteria and that do not have a specific impairment reserve typically have been previously written down through a partial charge off to their net realizable value 
the company s special assets staff assumes the management and monitoring of all loans determined to be impaired 
while awaiting the completion of the third party appraisal  the company generally begins to complete the tasks necessary to gain control of the collateral and prepare for liquidation  including  but not limited to engagement of counsel  inspection of collateral  and continued communication with the borrower  if appropriate 
special assets staff also regularly reviews the relationship to identify any potential adverse developments during this time 
generally  the only difference between current appraised value  adjusted for liquidation costs  and the carrying amount of the loan less the specific reserve is any downward adjustment to the appraised value that the company s special assets staff determines appropriate 
these differences generally consist of costs to sell the property  as well as a deflator for the devaluation of property when banks are the sellers  and management deems these fair value adjustments 

table of contents based on prior experience  the bank does not generally return loans to performing status after the loans have been partially charged off 
credits identified as impaired move quickly through the process towards ultimate resolution of the problem credit except in cases involving bankruptcy and various state judicial processes which may extend the time for ultimate resolution

liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of business management 
excess liquidity is generally used to pay down borrowings

the company also maintains policies and procedures regarding liquidity contingency planning 
the procedures call for liquidity monitoring through trending and ratio analysis  as well as forecasting budgeted and stressed scenarios 
the procedures provide guidance for potential action to be taken when certain liquidity thresholds are met 
since the company is a holding company and does not conduct significant operations  its primary sources of liquidity are dividends upstreamed from the bank and borrowings from outside sources

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s profitability is dependent to a large extent upon its net interest income  which is the difference between its interest income on interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and its interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
the company  like other financial institutions  is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that interest earning assets reprice differently than interest bearing liabilities 
the company manages its mix of assets and liabilities with the goals of limiting its exposure to interest rate risk  ensuring adequate liquidity  and coordinating its sources and uses of funds while maintaining an acceptable level of net interest income given the current interest rate environment 
the company s primary component of operational revenue  net interest income  is subject to variation as a result of changes in interest rate environments in conjunction with unbalanced repricing opportunities on earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
interest rate risk has four primary components repricing risk  basis risk  yield curve risk and option risk 
repricing risk occurs when earning assets and paying liabilities reprice at differing times as interest rates change 
basis risk occurs when the underlying rates on the assets and liabilities the institution holds change at different levels or in varying degrees 
yield curve risk is the risk of adverse consequences as a result of unequal changes in the spread between two or more rates for different maturities for the same instrument 
lastly  option risk is due to embedded options  often put or call options  given or sold to holders of financial instruments 
in order to mitigate the effect of changes in the general level of interest rates  the company manages repricing opportunities and thus  its interest rate sensitivity 
the company seeks to control its interest rate risk exposure to insulate net interest income and net earnings from fluctuations in the general level of interest rates 
to measure its exposure to interest rate risk  quarterly simulations of net interest income are performed using financial models that project net interest income through a range of possible interest rate environments including rising  declining  most likely and flat rate scenarios 
the simulation model used by the company captures all earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and off balance sheet financial instruments and combines the various factors affecting rate sensitivity into an earnings outlook and estimates of the economic value of equity for a range of assumed interest rate scenarios 
the results of these simulations indicate the existence and severity of interest rate risk in each of those rate environments based upon the current balance sheet position  assumptions as to changes in the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest paying liabilities and the company s estimate of yields to be attained in those future rate environments and rates that will be paid on various deposit instruments and borrowings 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rate changes  as well as changes in market conditions and the company s strategies 
however  the earnings simulation model is currently the best tool available to the company and the industry for managing interest rate risk 
the company has established policy limits for tolerance of interest rate risk in various interest rate scenarios 
in addition  the policy addresses exposure limits to changes in the economic value of equity according to predefined policy guidelines 
the most recent simulation indicates that current exposure to interest rate risk is within the company s defined policy limits 

table of contents the following table summarizes the impact of immediate and sustained rate shocks in the interest rate environment on net interest income and the economic value of equity as of december  and the model simulates plus to minus basis point changes from the base case rate simulation and illustrates the prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes over a twelve month time period 
this modeling technique  although useful  does not take into account all strategies that management might undertake in response to a sudden and sustained rate shock as depicted 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will also differ due to prepayment and refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate change caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  and other internal and external variables 
as of december   the federal open market committee maintained a target range for federal funds of to basis points  rendering a complete downward shock of basis points less meaningful  accordingly  downward rate scenarios are limited to minus basis points 
in the downward rate shocks presented  benchmark interest rates are assumed at levels with floors near 
rate sensitivity analysis december  amounts in thousands increase decrease in interest rates basis points change in net interest income percent change change in economic value of equity percent change december  amounts in thousands increase decrease in interest rates basis points change in net interest income percent change change in economic value of equity percent change the rate sensitivity simulation results show significantly improved performance in upward rate shock environments 
the improvement is largely due to increases in adjustable rate investment securities and low cost  stable non maturity deposits which were partially offset by decreases in cash balances 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary effect of inflation on the operations of the company is reflected in increased operating costs 
in management s opinion  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s consolidated performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily fluctuate in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services
