item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources and the notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of our accounting policies and other information related to these financial instruments 
we borrow funds at a combination of fixed and variable rates 
our debt consists of secured and unsecured long term financings  unsecured debt securities  loans and credit facilities  which typically bear interest at fixed rates although some loans bear interest at variable rates 
our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  from time to time we enter into interest rate hedge contracts such as collars  swaps  caps and treasury lock agreements in order to mitigate our interest rate risk with respect to various debt instruments 
we generally do not hold or issue these derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
at december   we had  million principal amount of fixed rate debt outstanding 
the estimated aggregate fair market value of this debt was  million 
if interest rates had been basis points higher  the aggregate fair market value of our fixed rate debt would have been approximately million lower 
if interest rates had been basis points lower  the aggregate fair market value of our fixed rate debt would have been approximately million higher 
at december   we had million of variable rate debt outstanding not protected by interest rate hedge contracts 
the estimated aggregate fair market value of this debt was million 
if the weighted average interest rate on this variable rate debt had been basis points higher  the aggregate fair market value of our variable rate debt would have decreased by approximately million and annual interest expense would increase million 
if the weighted average interest rate on this variable rate debt had been basis points lower  the aggregate fair market value of our variable rate debt would have increased by approximately million and annual interest expense would decrease million 
at december   we had forward starting  floating to fixed interest rate swaps with respect to an aggregate of future million libor based borrowings 
these swaps effectively fix the underlying libor rate at 
if libor interest rates increase or decrease by basis points  the aggregate fair market value of the future starting swaps at december  would increase by million or decrease by million  respectively 
we are exposed to certain losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties  which are major financial institutions  under the swaps 
we regularly evaluate the financial condition of our counterparties using publicly available information 
based on this review  we currently expect the counterparties to perform fully under the swaps 
however  if a counterparty defaults on its obligations under a swap  we could be required to pay the full rates on the applicable debt  even if such rates were in excess of the rate in the contract
