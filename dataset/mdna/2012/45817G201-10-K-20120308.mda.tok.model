critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the company s financial statements and accompanying notes 
significant estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements include impairment of goodwill  valuation of intangible assets  deferred tax valuation allowances  allowance for doubtful accounts  revenue allocation of multi element arrangements and the fair value of stock options granted under the company s stock based compensation plans 
due to the inherent uncertainties involved in making estimates  actual results reported in future periods may be different from those estimates 
we believe that there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenue and the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates 
these significant accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  stock based compensation  deferred taxes and commitments and contingencies 
these policies and our procedures related to these policies are described in detail below 
valuation of goodwill and other long lived assets our long lived assets include property and equipment  goodwill and intangible assets 
as of december   the balances of property and equipment  goodwill and intangible assets  all net of accumulated depreciation and amortization  were   and  respectively 
as of december   the balances of property and equipment  goodwill and intangible assets  all net of accumulated depreciation and amortization  were   and  respectively 
we depreciate property and equipment and amortize intangible assets that have finite lives over their estimated useful lives 
for purposes of determining whether there are any impairment losses  as further discussed below  management evaluates the carrying amounts of identifiable long lived tangible and intangible assets  including their estimated useful lives  when indicators of impairment are present as more fully described below 
based on our review of the carrying amounts of the long lived tangible and intangible assets with finite lives  we may also determine that shorter estimated useful lives are appropriate 
in that event  we record depreciation and amortization over shorter future periods  which would reduce our earnings 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations 
pursuant to asc topic  the company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter  or between annual tests  in certain circumstances 
under new guidance the company adopted for its test  the company first assessed qualitative factors to determine whether it was necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
an entity is not be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
the company reviewed qualitative factors including macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors overall financial performance other entity specific events sustained decrease in share price based on the company s assessment of these qualitative factors  it determined that that it is more likely than not that its fair value is greater than its carrying amount and that no impairment was recognized for the year ended december  there were also no impairments recognized during the years ended december  and intangible assets acquired intangible assets include trade names  patents  developed technology and backlog described more fully in note the company uses the straight line method to amortize these assets over their estimated useful lives 
the company reviews its long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable in accordance with asc topic to determine recoverability of its long lived assets  the company evaluates the probability that future undiscounted net cash flows  without interest charges  will be less than the carrying amount of the assets 
impairment is measured at fair value 
no impairments were recognized during the years ended december   and revenue recognition and deferred revenue revenue is generally recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable  collectability is probable  and there is no future company involvement or commitment 
the company sells its commercial products directly through its sales force and through distributors 
revenue from direct sales of products is recognized when shipped to the customer and title has passed 
under the provisions of asc topic  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  for multi element arrangements that include tangible products containing software essential to the tangible product s functionality and undelivered software elements relating to the tangible product s essential software  the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices 
in such circumstances  the company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables i vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe  ii third party evidence of selling price and iii best estimate of the selling price esp 
vsoe generally exists only when the company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the company for that deliverable 
esps reflect the company s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand alone basis 
the company also recognizes revenues from licensing of its patented software to customers 
the licensed software requires continuing service or post contractual customer support and performance  accordingly  a portion of the revenue is deferred based on its fair value and recognized ratably over the period in which the future service  support and performance are provided  which is generally one to three years 
royalties from the licensing of the company s technology are recognized as revenues in the period they are earned 
revenue from research and development contracts are generally with government agencies under long term cost plus fixed fee contracts  where revenue is based on time and material costs incurred 
revenue from these arrangements is recognized as time is spent on the contract and materials are purchased 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
the company also performs consulting work for other companies 
these services are billed based on time and materials 
revenue from these arrangements is also recognized as time is spent on the contract and materials are purchased 
subscriptions to database information can be purchased for month to month  one  two  and three year periods 
revenue from subscriptions are deferred and recognized over the contractual period  which is typically three years 
the company offers enhanced extended warranties for its sales of hardware and software at a set price 
the revenue from these sales are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the contractual period  which is typically one to three years 
stock based compensation the company accounts for the issuance of equity awards to employees in accordance with asc topic and  which requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements 
this pronouncement establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share based payment arrangements and requires all companies to apply a fair value based measurement method in accounting for all share based payment transactions with employees 
deferred income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and net operating loss carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using expected tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets as of december   due to the uncertainty of the realizability of those assets 
commitments and contingencies we are not currently involved in any legal or regulatory proceeding  or arbitration  the outcome of which is expected to have a material adverse effect on our business 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
results of operations all figures were rounded to the nearest  comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  revenue 
total revenues were approximately higher in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  year ended december  change identity systems   wireless r d   the increase in the identity systems revenues in is principally a result of increased fugitive finder and defense id sales to military bases 
the decrease in wireless r d revenues in is because the previous funding of the fan buoy contract expired as of the end of june and the new funding was not awarded until the middle of september 
total booked orders were million in compared to million in as of december   our backlog  which represents non cancelable sales orders for products not yet shipped and services to be performed  was approximately million compared to million at december  the entire backlog is expected to be realized over the next twelve to fifteen months 
period to period comparisons may not be indicative of future operating results  since we still face long sales cycles  particularly in the government sector  and  therefore  we cannot predict with certainty in which period the opportunities currently in the pipeline will develop into sales or if they will develop at all

total revenues were approximately lower in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  year ended december  change identity systems   wireless r d   the increase in the identity systems revenues in is primarily a result of higher sales in the commercial sector as well as higher software engineering fees to customers in the financial sector

total booked orders were million in compared to million in as of december   our backlog was approximately million compared to million at december  the decrease is primarily a result of million in billings on the fan buoy r d contract during gross profit

the maximum borrowing under the facility is  borrowings under the facility are subject to certain limitations based on a percentage of accounts receivable  as defined in the agreement  and are secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
at december   there were no outstanding borrowings and unused availability under the facility was approximately we currently anticipate that our available cash  as well as expected cash from operations and availability under the revolving credit agreement  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capitals and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
we keep the option open to raise additional funds to respond to business contingencies which may include the need to fund more rapid expansion  fund additional marketing expenditures  develop new markets for our technology  enhance our operating infrastructure  respond to competitive pressures  or acquire complementary businesses or necessary technologies

we are not currently involved in any legal or regulatory proceeding  or arbitration  the outcome of which is expected to have a material adverse effect on our business 
adjusted ebitda the company uses adjusted ebitda as a non gaap financial performance measurement 
adjusted ebitda is calculated by adding back to net loss interest  income taxes  impairments of long lived assets and goodwill  depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation expense 
adjusted ebitda is provided to investors to supplement the results of operations reported in accordance with gaap 
management believes that adjusted ebitda provides an additional tool for investors to use in comparing intellicheck mobilisa financial results with other companies that also use adjusted ebitda in their communications to investors 
by excluding non cash charges such as impairments of long lived assets and goodwill  amortization  depreciation and stock based compensation  as well as non operating charges for interest and income taxes  investors can evaluate the company s operations and can compare its results on a more consistent basis to the results of other companies 
in addition  adjusted ebitda is one of the primary measures management uses to monitor and evaluate financial and operating results 
intellicheck mobilisa considers adjusted ebitda to be an important indicator of the company s operational strength and performance of its business and a useful measure of the company s historical operating trends 
however  there are significant limitations to the use of adjusted ebitda since it excludes interest income and expense  impairments of long lived assets and goodwill  stock based compensation expense  all of which impact the company s profitability  as well as depreciation and amortization related to the use of long term assets which benefit multiple periods 
the company believes that these limitations are compensated by providing adjusted ebitda only with gaap net loss and clearly identifying the difference between the two measures 
consequently  adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net loss presented in accordance with gaap 
adjusted ebitda as defined by the company may not be comparable with similarly named measures provided by other entities 
a reconciliation of gaap net loss to adjusted ebitda follows rounded to the nearest  year ended december  unaudited net income loss    reconciling items interest net    provision benefit for income taxes depreciation and amortization   stock based compensation costs    impairments of long lived assets and goodwill adjusted ebitda    related party transactions mobilisa leases office space from a company lessor company that is wholly owned by two directors  who are members of management 
the company entered into a year lease for the office space ending in the annual rent for this facility is currently  and is subject to annual increases based on the increase in the cpi index plus 
for the year ended december   and total rent payments for this office space were   and  in addition  during  the company paid an additional  representing prior year cpi increases 
the lessor company s entire operations consist of the leased property and related bank debt 
the company is a guarantor of the loans for the leased property 
as of december   the company s maximum exposure to loss is  under asc topic  amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r  companies are required to consolidate a related variable interest entity vie when the reporting company is the primary beneficiary of that entity and holds a variable interest in the vie 
the determination of whether a reporting company is the primary beneficiary of a vie ultimately turns on whether the reporting entity will absorb a majority of the vie s anticipated losses or receive a majority of the vie s anticipated gains 
the company analyzed its transactions with and relationship to the lessor company and concluded that it had an implicit variable interest in the lessor company 
however  the primary beneficiary  based on an assessment of what entity absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of its expected residual returns  or both  as a result of holding variable interests  are the common owners 
accordingly  the company is not required to consolidate the operations of the lessor company 
net operating loss carry forwards as of december   the company had net operating loss carryforwards nols for federal income tax purposes of approximately million 
there can be no assurance that the company will realize the benefit of the nols 
the federal nols are available to offset future taxable income and expire from to if not utilized 
the company has not yet completed its review to determine whether or not these nols will be limited under section of the internal revenue code due to the ownership change from the acquisition of mobilisa
