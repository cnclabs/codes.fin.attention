definition of organic growth organic growth represents the change in revenues or operating profit between the current and prior period  excluding the effect of the following items acquisitions and dispositions  changes in currency exchange rates as described on page and the remeasurement of net monetary assets in venezuela under highly inflationary accounting 
business and strategy overview we have four geographic operating segments europe  middle east  and africa emea  latin america  asia pacific  and north america  which are aggregated into two reportable segments international and north america 
our north america segment includes operations in the us and canada 
we believe that brink s has significant competitive advantages including brand name recognition reputation for a high level of service and security risk management and logistics expertise global infrastructure and customer base proprietary cash processing and information systems proven operational excellence high quality insurance coverage and general financial strength we focus our time and resources on service quality  protecting and strengthening our brand  and addressing our risks 
we are a premium provider of services in most of the markets we serve 
our marketing and sales efforts are enhanced by the brink s brand  so we seek to protect and build its value 
since our services focus on handling  transporting  protecting  and managing valuables  we strive to understand and manage risk 
overlaying our approach is an understanding that we must be disciplined and patient enough to charge prices that reflect the value provided  the risk assumed and the need for an adequate return for our investors 
business environments around the world change constantly 
we must adapt to changes in competitive landscapes  regional economies and each customer s level of business 
we balance underlying business risk and the effects of changing demand on the utilization of our resources 
as a result  we operate largely on a decentralized basis so local management can react quickly to changes in the business environment 
we measure financial performance on a long term basis 
the key financial measures are return on capital revenue and earnings growth cash flow generation these and similar measures are critical components of our incentive compensation plans and performance evaluations 
because of our emphasis on managing risks while providing a high level of service  we focus our marketing and selling efforts on customers who appreciate the value and breadth of our services  information and risk management capabilities  and financial strength 
in order to earn an adequate return on capital  we focus on the effective and efficient use of resources as well as appropriate pricing levels 
we attempt to maximize the amount of business that flows through our branches  vehicles and systems in order to obtain the lowest costs possible without compromising safety  security or service 
due to our higher investment in people and processes  we generally charge higher prices than competitors that do not provide the same level of service and risk management 
the industries we serve have been consolidating 
as a result  the demands and expectations of customers in these industries have grown 
customers are increasingly seeking suppliers  such as brink s  with broad geographic solutions  sophisticated outsourcing capabilities and financial strength 
operating results may vary from period to period 
since revenues are generated from charges per service performed or based on the value of goods transported  they can be affected by both the level of economic activity and the volume of business for specific customers 
as contracts generally run for one or more years  costs are incurred to prepare to serve  or to transition away  from a customer 
we also periodically incur costs to reduce operations when volumes decline  including costs to reduce the number of employees and close or consolidate branch and administrative facilities 
in addition  safety and security costs can vary depending on performance  cost of insurance coverage  and changes in crime rates ie  attacks and robberies 
cash logistics is a fully integrated solution that proactively manages the supply chain of cash from point of sale through bank deposit 
the process includes cashier balancing and reporting  deposit processing and consolidation  and electronic information exchange including same day credit capabilities 
retail customers use brink s cash logistics services to count and reconcile coins and currency in a secure environment  to prepare bank deposit information  and to replenish customer coins and currency in proper denominations 
because cash logistics involves a higher level of service and more complex activities  customers are charged higher prices  which result in higher margins 
the ability to offer cash logistics to customers differentiates brink s from many of its competitors 
management is focused on continuing to grow cash logistics revenue 
brink s revenues and related operating profit are generally higher in the second half of the year  particularly in the fourth quarter  because of generally increased economic activity associated with the holiday season

outlook for we expect net income attributable to noncontrolling interests on a gaap and non gaap basis to be million to million in as compared to million on a gaap basis and million on a non gaap basis in our outlook reflects expected increased earnings from non wholly owned subsidiaries  including venezuela

foreign operations we currently serve customers in more than countries  including approximately countries where we operate subsidiaries 
we are subject to risks customarily associated with doing business in foreign countries  including labor and economic conditions  political instability  controls on repatriation of earnings and capital  nationalization  expropriation and other forms of restrictive action by local governments 
changes in the political or economic environments in the countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the future effects  if any  of these risks are unknown 
our international operations conduct a majority of their business in local currencies 
because our financial results are reported in us dollars  they are affected by changes in the value of various local currencies in relation to the us dollar 
brink s venezuela is subject to local laws and regulatory interpretations that determine the exchange rate at which repatriating dividends may be converted 
see application of critical accounting policies foreign currency translation on page for a description of our accounting methods and assumptions used to include our venezuelan operation in our consolidated financial statements  and a description of the accounting for subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies 
changes in exchange rates may also affect transactions which are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
from time to time  we use foreign currency forward and swap contracts to hedge transactional risks associated with foreign currencies  as discussed in item a on page at december   the notional value of our outstanding foreign currency contracts was million with average contract maturities of less than month 
the foreign currency contracts primarily offset exposures in the mexican peso and the euro 
these contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes  and accordingly  changes in their fair value are recorded immediately in earnings 
we recognized gains of million on our foreign currency contracts in at december   the fair value of these outstanding contracts was an asset of million which was included in prepaid and other on the consolidated balance sheet 
liquidity and capital resources overview over the last three years  we have used cash generated from our continuing operations to invest in the infrastructure of our business new facilities  cash sorting and other equipment for our cash logistics operations  armored trucks  compusafe units  and customer facing and back office information technology million  acquire businesses million including million in  primarily in mexico and canada  and million in bric brazil  russia  india and china countries in  make voluntary contributions to our primary us pension plan million in  pay dividends million  and repurchase shares of our common stock million we entered into a new master lease agreement in late to finance the acquisition of new armored vehicles in the us vehicles acquired under the lease agreement have been accounted for as capital leases 
vehicles acquired under the previous master lease agreement were accounted for as operating leases 
outlook we continue to consider acquisition opportunities in the secure transportation and cash logistics industry and in adjacent security markets 
we may use our cash from operations and borrowings to fund the purchase of these acquisitions 
we expect our capital expenditures in to increase from the amounts spent in as we continue to invest in armored vehicles  facilities and technology 
we expect capital expenditures to decrease in north america  and increase in our international segment 
we will be required to make contributions of million to our primary us pension plan in based on current assumptions  we expect to make additional contributions totalling million during the next five years 
we intend to contribute company stock for some or all of the required contribution and we may choose to contribute company stock for future required contributions 
operating activities years ended december  change in millions cash flows from operating activities non gaap basis decrease increase in certain customer obligations a contribution to primary us pension plan  net of current tax benefit b discontinued operations c gaap basis a to eliminate the change in the balance of customer obligations related to cash received and processed in certain of our secure cash logistics operations

b to eliminate the net of tax cash contributions to the primary us pension plan in million cash contribution  net of the related million current tax benefit 
c to eliminate cash flows related to our discontinued operations 
non gaap cash flows from operating activities are supplemental financial measures that are not required by  or presented in accordance with gaap 
the purpose of the non gaap cash flows from operating activities is to report financial information excluding the impact of cash received and processed in certain of our secure cash logistics operations  without cash flows from discontinued operations and excluding the cash contributions to the primary us pension plan  net of related current tax benefits 
brink s believes these measures are helpful in assessing cash flows from operations  enable period to period comparability and are useful in predicting future operating cash flows 
non gaap cash flows from operating activities should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated statements of cash flows 
versus on a gaap basis  operating cash flows increased by million in compared to as a result of a million increase in cash flows from continuing operations and an million decrease in cash used by discontinued operations 
cash flows from discontinued operations improved because the prior year period included million in cash outflow for a legal claim associated with bax global  a former business unit 
cash from continuing operations increased million due to higher operating profit and an increase in cash flows from working capital  partially offset by a million decrease in cash flows due to change in customer obligations for cash held by logistics and a million legal settlement payment related to the exit of our belgium cit business and an increase in interest payments 
the amount of cash generated by operating profit was higher than the increase in operating profit primarily because noncash depreciation and amortization expenses were higher in compared to driven by fixed assets acquired in and the mexican acquisition in november on a non gaap basis  cash flows from operating activities increased by million 
the increase in cash flows was primarily due to higher operating profit and an increase in cash flows from working capital  partially offset by a million legal settlement payment related to the exit of our belgium cit business and an increase in interest payments 
the amount of cash generated by operating profit was higher than the increase in operating profit primarily because noncash depreciation and amortization expenses were higher in compared to driven by new fixed asset acquisitions in the second half of and the mexican acquisition in november mr 
michael dan  former president and ceo  retired in december and was paid million as provided for under his succession agreement 
mr 
dan is also owed an million pension benefit payment in  of which million was paid in january these pension benefits have been funded by assets in an existing grantor trust 
he will also receive in a distribution of company stock for his accumulated deferred compensation  net of minimum tax withholding 
versus on a gaap basis  operating cash flows increased by million in compared to as a result of a million increase in cash flows from continuing operations  offset by a million decrease in cash flow from discontinued operations 
operating cash flows from continuing operations were higher in mainly due to a million cash contribution made in to our us pension plan 
our operating cash flows in also included million of income tax refunds  much of which were primarily the result of tax deductions associated with the us pension cash contribution and million of brink s common stock that was also contributed to the plan 
in certain cash logistics operations  title to the cash we receive and process transfers to us for a short period of time but is then generally credited to customers accounts the following day 
we do not consider this cash as available for general corporate purposes 
the increase in amounts owed to customers for these cash processing operations contributed million to the increase in operating cash flows 
the decrease in cash flows provided by discontinued operations resulted from the receipt of million federal black lung excise tax cash refunds in compared to an million payment for a legal claim associated with bax global  a former business unit 
on a non gaap basis  cash flows from operations declined by million in compared to the decrease was primarily due to the effects of receiving million in income tax refunds in as well as an increase in the use of cash for working capital needs in investing activities years ended december  change in millions cash flows from investing activities capital expenditures acquisitions other investing activities the cash used by investing activities in was lower than as a result of million of cash used in to purchase new businesses  primarily operations in mexico and canada  offset by higher capital expenditures in  as described below 
in addition  we had higher proceeds from the sale of investments and other property in cash flows from investing activities decreased by million in primarily due to a million increase in cash used to acquire businesses  partially offset by a million decrease in capital expenditures as a result of an increase in the use of capital leases to acquire armored vehicles and compusafe units in north america

b represents the amount of property and equipment acquired using capital leases 
amounts are provided here to assist in the comparison of assets acquired in the current year versus prior years 
capital expenditures in were primarily for information technology  armored vehicles and new cash processing and security equipment 
capital expenditures in increased when compared to primarily due to an increase in our international segment 
the increase in our international segment is largely due to capital expenditures in mexico 
capital expenditures in were primarily for new cash processing and security equipment  armored vehicles  information technology and compusafe units 
capital expenditures in decreased mainly due to lower expenditures in our north america segment 
the decrease in our north america segment was due to an increase in leasing armored vehicles and compusafe units 
capital expenditures have exceeded depreciation and amortization in the last several years and this trend is expected to continue in the next several years as a result of growth in the infrastructure of our operations  including new branch facilities and leasehold improvements  growth in technology investments  and investment in the safety and security of our operations 
financing activities summary of financing activities years ended december  in millions cash provided used by financing activities borrowings and repayments short term debt long term revolving credit facilities issuance of private placement notes other long term debt borrowings repayments debt financing costs repurchase shares of common stock of brink s cash proceeds from sale leaseback transactions dividends attributable to shareholders of brink s noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries proceeds and tax benefits related to stock compensation and other cash flows from financing activities debt repayments in  our net repayments were million as compared to net borrowings of million in the change resulted primarily from borrowings in to fund business acquisitions and the repurchase of common stock 
in  on a net basis  we repaid a portion of our debt as cash flows from operating activities exceeded the net cash used by our investing activities 
share purchases in  we purchased  shares of our common stock for million at an average price of per share 
in  we purchased  shares of our common stock at an average cost of per share 
we also used million in early to settle share purchases initiated in december in  we did not purchase any shares of our common stock 
dividends we paid dividends of per share in each of the last quarters 
future dividends are dependent on our earnings  financial condition  shareholders equity levels  our cash flow and business requirements  as determined by the board of directors 
capitalization we use a combination of debt  leases and equity to capitalize our operations 
as of december   debt as a percentage of capitalization defined as total debt and equity was compared to at december  the increase resulted from a reduction in equity compared to the end of primarily as a result of actuarial losses caused by lower discount rates for retirement plans exceeding net income during summary of debt  equity and other liquidity information amount available under credit facilities outstanding balance december  december  in millions change a debt multi currency revolving facilities revolving facility letter of credit facilities credit facility private placement notes dominion terminal associates bonds capital leases other debt total equity a in addition to cash borrowings and repayments  the change in the debt balance also includes changes in currency exchange rates and new capital lease agreements

the cash is generally credited to customers accounts the following day and we do not consider it as available for general corporate purposes in the management of our liquidity and capital resources and in our computation of net debt 
net debt is a supplemental non gaap financial measure that is not required by  or presented in accordance with gaap 
we use net debt as a measure of our financial leverage 
we believe that investors also may find net debt to be helpful in evaluating our financial leverage 
net debt should not be considered as an alternative to debt determined in accordance with gaap and should be reviewed in conjunction with our consolidated balance sheets 
set forth above is a reconciliation of net debt  a non gaap financial measure  to debt  which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with gaap  as of december   and december  net debt excluding cash and debt in venezuelan operations was million at december   and million at december  net debt was slightly lower at the end of compared to as a result of cash flows from operating activities exceeding cash flow from investing activities 
liquidity needs our operating liquidity needs are typically financed by cash from operations  short term debt and the revolving facility our debt facilities are described below 
we have certain limitations and considerations related to the cash and borrowing capacity that are reported in our consolidated financial statements 
based on our current cash on hand  amounts available under our credit facilities and current projections of cash flows from operations  we believe that we will be able to meet our liquidity needs for more than the next twelve months 
limitations on dividends from foreign subsidiaries 
a significant portion of our operations are outside the us which may make it difficult to repatriate cash for use in the us see item a  risk factors  for more information on the risks associated with having businesses outside the us incremental taxes 
we have approximately million of cash held by subsidiaries that we consider to be permanently invested and for which we do not expect to repatriate to the us if we decided to repatriate this cash to the us  we may have to accrue and pay additional income taxes 
given the number of foreign operations and the complexities of the tax law  it is not practical to estimate the potential tax liability  but the amount of taxes owed could be material depending on how and when the repatriation occurred 
venezuela 
in  venezuela began limiting conversions of bolivar fuertes to us dollars to  per legal entity per month 
as a result  we do not anticipate repatriation of cash from our venezuelan operations to the us for the foreseeable future 
this may limit our ability to use funds earned in venezuela for general corporate purposes  including reducing our debt 
at december   our venezuelan subsidiaries held million of cash and short term investments denominated in us dollars and million of cash denominated in bolivar fuertes 
pension contributions 
we intend to contribute company stock to satisfy some or all of the million in contributions that are required for instead of using cash 
we may also use company stock in the future to satisfy future contributions 
the contributions after total million based on current assumptions 
debt on january   we amended our unsecured revolving bank credit facility the revolving facility 
the amendment provides for an increase in the amount of the revolving facility from million to million at more favorable pricing and extends the maturity date from july to january the revolving facility s interest rate is based on libor plus a margin  alternate base rate plus a margin  or competitive bid 
the revolving facility allows us to borrow or issue letters of credit or otherwise satisfy credit needs on a revolving basis over the term of the facility 
as of december   million was available under the revolving facility 
amounts outstanding under the revolving facility as of december   were denominated primarily in us dollars and to a lesser extent in canadian dollars 
the margin on libor borrowings under the revolving facility  which ranged from to depending on our credit rating  was at december  under the amended revolving facility  the margin on libor borrowings can range from to and was at january  the margin on alternate base rate borrowings under the revolving facility ranged from to 
under the amended revolving facility  the alternate base rate borrowings can range from to 
we also pay an annual facility fee on the revolving facility based on our credit rating 
the facility fee  which ranged from to  was at december  under the amended revolving facility  the facility fee can range from to and was at january  on january   we issued million in unsecured notes through a private placement debt transaction the notes 
the notes comprise million in series a notes with a fixed interest rate of and million in series b notes with a fixed interest rate of 
the notes are due in january with principal payments under the series a notes to begin in january the proceeds of million were utilized to pay down the revolving facility 
as of december   we had three unsecured multi currency revolving bank credit facilities with a total of million in available credit  of which approximately million was available 
a million facility expires in december  another million facility expires in may and a million facility expires in october interest on these facilities is based on libor plus a margin 
the margin ranges from to 
we also have the ability to borrow from other banks  at the banks discretion  under short term uncommitted agreements 
various foreign subsidiaries maintain other lines of credit and overdraft facilities with a number of banks 
we have two unsecured letter of credit facilities totaling million  of which approximately million was available at december  a million facility expires in december and an million facility expires in june the revolving facility and the multi currency revolving credit facilities are also used for issuance of letters of credit and bank guarantees 
on january   we entered into a million unsecured letter of credit facility that will expire in december we also have an unsecured bilateral committed credit facility the credit facility with a total of million in available credit that expires in march interest on this facility is based on libor plus a margin  which ranges from to 
as of december   million was available under the credit facility 
the revolving facility  the notes  the three unsecured multi currency revolving bank credit facilities  the two letter of credit facilities and the credit facility contain subsidiary guarantees and various financial and other covenants 
the financial covenants  among other things  limit our total indebtedness  limit priority debt  limit asset sales  limit the use of proceeds from asset sales and provide for minimum coverage of interest costs 
the credit agreements do not provide for the acceleration of payments should our credit rating be reduced 
if we were not to comply with the terms of our various credit agreements  the repayment terms could be accelerated and the commitments could be withdrawn 
an acceleration of the repayment terms under one agreement could trigger the acceleration of the repayment terms under the other loan agreements 
we were in compliance with all financial covenants at december  we have million of bonds issued by the peninsula ports authority of virginia recorded as debt on our balance sheet 
although we are not the primary obligor of the debt  we have guaranteed the debt and we believe that we will ultimately pay this obligation 
the guarantee originated as part of a former interest in dominion terminal associates  a deep water coal terminal 
we continue to pay interest on the debt 
the bonds bear a fixed interest rate of and mature in the bonds may mature prior to upon the occurrence of specified events such as the determination that the bonds are taxable or if we fail to abide by the terms of the guarantee

shelf registration of common stock we intend to register million in new common stock in we intend to issue shares in to satisfy some or all of the required contributions to our primary us pension plan 
we may also issue shares in the future to satisfy future contributions 
preferred stock at december   we had the authority to issue up to million shares of preferred stock  par value per share 
off balance sheet arrangements we have operating leases that are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
see note for operating leases that have residual value guarantees or other terms that cause the agreement to be considered a variable interest 
we use operating leases to lower our cost of financings 
we believe that operating leases are an important component of our capital structure

based on current assumptions we will begin annual contributions to the plan in which will continue for six years  totaling million 
we intend to make the contribution at least in part through the use of shares of our common stock 
we may also contribute shares in the future to satisfy future contributions 
umwa plans retirement benefits related to former coal operations include medical benefits provided by the pittston coal group companies employee benefit plan for umwa represented employees

the company does not expect to make additional contributions to these plans until black lung under the federal black lung benefits act of  brink s is responsible for paying lifetime black lung benefits to miners and their dependents for claims filed and approved after june  there are approximately black lung beneficiaries 
other we have a plan that provides retirement health care benefits to certain eligible salaried employees 
benefits under this plan are not indexed for inflation 
assumptions for us retirement obligations we have made various assumptions to estimate the amount of payments to be made in the future 
the most significant assumptions include changing discount rates and other assumptions in effect at measurement dates normally december investment returns of plan assets addition of new participants historically immaterial due to freezing of pension benefits and exit from coal business mortality rates change in laws the contractual obligations table above represents payments projected to be paid with our corporate funds and does not represent payments projected to be made to beneficiaries with retirement plan assets

discounted cash flows at plan discount rates reconciled to liability amounts reported under us gaap december  in millions primary us pension plan b umwa plans c other unfunded us plans total funded status of us retirement plans gaap present value of projected earnings of plan assets a discounted cash flows at plan discount rates non gaap plan discount rate expected return of assets a under gaap  the funded status of a benefit plan is reduced by the fair market value of plan assets at the balance sheet date  and the present value of the projected earnings on plan assets does not reduce the funded status at the balance sheet date 
the non gaap measure presented above additionally reduces the funded status as computed under gaap by the present value of projected earnings of plan assets using the expected return on asset assumptions of the respective plan 
b for the primary us pension plan  we are required by erisa regulations to maintain minimum funding levels  and as a result  we estimate we will be required to make minimum required contributions from to we have estimated that we will achieve the required funded ratio after the contribution 
c there are no minimum funding requirements for the umwa plans because they are not covered by erisa funding regulations 
using assumptions at the end of  we project that the plan assets plus expected earnings on those investments will cover the benefit payments for these plans until we project that brink s will be required to contribute cash to the plan beginning in to pay beneficiaries 
discounted cash flows at plan discount rates are supplemental financial measures that are not required by  or presented in accordance with gaap 
the purpose of the discounted cash flows at plan discount rate is to present our retirement obligations after giving effect to the benefit of earning a return on plan assets 
we believe this measure is helpful in assessing the present value of our future funding requirements in order to meet plan benefit obligations 
discounted cash flows at plan discount rates should not be considered as an alternative to the funded status of the us retirement plans at december   as determined in accordance with gaap and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated balance sheets 
contingent matters bankruptcy of brink s belgium our former cash in transit subsidiary in belgium brink s belgium filed for bankruptcy in november after a restructuring plan was rejected by local union employees and was placed into bankruptcy on february  we continue to operate our global services unit in belgium  which provides secure transport of diamonds  jewellery  precious metals  banknotes and other commodities 
in december  the court appointed provisional administrators of brink s belgium filed a claim for million against a subsidiary of brink s

the conditions of the settlement agreement included a release from liability by affected employees  the belgian tax authority and the belgian social security authority 
these conditions were satisfied and the settlement was finalized during the third quarter of we recorded a pretax charge of million approximately million in the second quarter of related to this claim 
other we are involved in various other lawsuits and claims in the ordinary course of business 
we are not able to estimate the range of losses for some of these matters 
we have recorded accruals for losses that are considered probable and reasonably estimable 
we do not believe that the ultimate disposition of any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  financial position or results of operations 
application of critical accounting policies the application of accounting principles requires the use of assumptions  estimates and judgments 
we make assumptions  estimates and judgments based on  among other things  knowledge of operations  markets  historical trends and likely future changes  similarly situated businesses and  when appropriate  the opinions of advisors with relevant knowledge and experience 
reported results could have been materially different had we used a different set of assumptions  estimates and judgments 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance deferred tax assets result primarily from net operating losses and the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes  as determined under enacted tax laws and rates 
accounting policies we establish valuation allowances in accordance with fasb asc topic  income taxes  when we estimate it is not more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized 
we decide to record valuation allowances primarily based on an assessment of historical earnings and future taxable income that incorporates prudent  feasible tax planning strategies 
we assess deferred tax assets on an individual jurisdiction basis 
changes in tax statutes  the timing of deductibility of expenses or expectations for future performance could result in material adjustments to our valuation allowances  which would increase or decrease tax expense 
our valuation allowances are as follows 
valuation allowances december  in millions us non us total application of accounting policies us deferred tax assets we have million of net deferred tax assets at december   and million related to us jurisdictions 
we changed our judgment about the need for a deferred tax asset valuation allowance for foreign tax credit carryforwards in the us as a result of tax planning strategies to repatriate non us earnings to enable us to utilize the credit carryfoward 
as a result  we reversed million of valuation allowances in that were originally recorded in other than foreign tax credits  there were no significant changes to our us valuation allowances in we used various estimates and assumptions to evaluate the need for the valuation allowance in the us these included projected revenues and operating income for our us entities  estimated required contributions to our us retirement plans  and interest rates on projected us borrowings 
had we used different assumptions  we might have made different conclusions about the need for valuation allowances 
for example  using different assumptions in and we might have concluded that we require a valuation allowance offsetting our us deferred tax assets at the end of and non us deferred tax assets we changed our judgment about the need for valuation allowances for deferred tax assets in certain non us jurisdictions as a result of improvements in operating results and an improved outlook about the future operating performance in those jurisdictions 
as a result  we reversed million of valuation allowances in and million of valuation allowances in through continuing operations 
goodwill  other intangible assets and property and equipment valuations accounting policies at december   we had property and equipment of million  goodwill of million and other intangible assets of million  net of accumulated depreciation and amortization 
we review these assets for possible impairment using the guidance in fasb asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other  for goodwill and other intangible assets and fasb asc topic  property  plant and equipment  for property and equipment 
our review for impairment requires the use of significant judgments about the future performance of our operating subsidiaries 
due to the many variables inherent in the estimates of the fair value of these assets  differences in assumptions could have a material effect on the impairment analyses 
application of accounting policies goodwill we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that impairment may have occurred 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units  and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
we perform a qualitative assessment in order to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
as part of this assessment  we review qualitative factors such as the amount of excess fair value from the most recent quantitative analysis  changes in the reporting unit carrying values  changes in market conditions as well as other factors specific to each reporting unit 
if fair value is required to be determined for any reporting unit  we estimate the fair value using a discounted cash flow methodology 
the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value to determine if impairment is indicated 
for the assessment  we have determined that qualitative factors are present which indicate that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeds its carrying value 
as a result  we have not updated our quantitative assessment of fair value for the reporting units 
due to a history of profitability and cash flow generation along with expectations for future cash flows  we have determined that the fair value of the latin america and asia pacific reporting units substantially exceeds carrying value 
however  during our qualitative assessment  we noted factors that would indicate that the fair value of two of the reporting units  north america and emea  may no longer be substantially in excess of fair value 
this decline is driven primarily by lower than previously anticipated performance in both of these reporting units 
north america and emea have million and million in goodwill  respectively  as of december  the qualitative assessment performed is inherently subjective  with a number of factors based on assumptions and judgments 
changes in assumptions and results due to economic conditions  industry factors and reporting unit performance could result in different assessments of the fair value and could result in impairment charges in the future 
indefinite lived intangibles we review indefinite lived intangibles for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that impairment may have occurred 
an indefinite lived intangible is also evaluated each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
the annual impairment test is performed by comparing the carrying value of the intangible to its estimated fair value 
we have had no significant impairments of indefinite lived intangibles in the last three years 
other intangible assets and property and equipment we review long lived assets besides goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
for purposes of assessing impairment  assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets 
to determine whether impairment has occurred  we compare estimates of the future undiscounted net cash flows of groups of assets to their carrying value 
retirement and postemployment benefit obligations we provide benefits through defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical benefit plans and under statutory requirements 
accounting policy we account for pension and other retirement benefit obligations under fasb asc topic  compensation retirement benefits 
we account for postemployment benefit obligations  including workers compensation obligations  under fasb asc topic  compensation nonretirement postemployment benefits 
to account for these benefits  we make assumptions of expected return on assets  discount rates  inflation  demographic factors and changes in the laws and regulations covering the benefit obligations 
because of the inherent volatility of these items and because the obligations are significant  changes in the assumptions could have a material effect on our liabilities and expenses related to these benefits 
our most significant retirement plans include our primary us pension plan and the retiree medical plans of our former coal business that were collectively bargained with the united mine workers of america the umwa 
the critical accounting estimates that determine the carrying values of liabilities and the resulting annual expense are discussed below 
application of accounting policy discount rate assumptions for plans accounted under fasb asc topic  we discount estimated future payments using discount rates based on market conditions at the end of the year 
in general  our liability changes in an inverse relationship to interest rates 
that is  the lower the discount rate  the higher the associated plan obligation 
we derive the discount rates used to measure the present value of our benefit obligations using the cash flow matching method 
under this method  we compare the plan s projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yields on the mercer yield curve 
each year s projected cash flows are then discounted back to their present value at the measurement date and an overall discount rate is determined 
the overall discount rate is then rounded to the nearest tenth of a percentage point 
the discount rates for the primary us pension plan  umwa retiree medical plans and black lung obligations were primary us plan umwa plans black lung discount rate retirement cost benefit obligation at year end sensitivity analysis the discount rate we select at year end affects the valuations of plan obligations at year end and calculations of net periodic expenses for the following year 
the tables below compare hypothetical plan obligation valuations for our largest plans as of december   actual expenses for and projected expenses for assuming we had used discount rates that were one percentage point lower or higher 
plan obligations at december  hypothetical hypothetical in millions lower actual higher primary us pension plan umwa plans actual and projected expense income hypothetical sensitivity analysis hypothetical sensitivity analysis in millions  except percentages for discount rate assumption for discount rate assumption actual lower higher projected lower higher years ending december  primary us pension plan discount rate assumption retirement cost credit umwa plans discount rate assumption retirement cost expected return on assets assumption our expected return on assets assumption  which affects our net periodic benefit cost  reflects the long term average rate of return we expect the plan assets to earn 
we select the expected return on assets assumption using advice from our investment advisor and actuary considering each plan s asset allocation targets and expected overall investment manager performance and a review of the most recent long term historical average compounded rates of return  as applicable 
we selected as the expected return on assets assumption for our primary us plan and for our umwa retiree medical plans as of december  we selected for both plans as of december  over the last ten years  the annual returns of our primary us pension plan have averaged  on a compounded basis   net of fees  while the year and year compounded annual return averaged  and the year compounded annual return averaged 
sensitivity analysis effect of using different expected rate of return assumptions 
our and projected expense would have been different if we had used different expected rate of return assumptions 
for every hypothetical change of one percentage point in the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets and holding other assumptions constant  our and expense would be as follows 
hypothetical sensitivity analysis hypothetical sensitivity analysis for expected return on asset for expected return on asset in millions  except percentages assumption assumption actual lower higher projected lower higher years ending december  expected return on asset assumption primary us pension plan umwa plans primary us pension plan umwa plans effect of improving or deteriorating actual future market returns

hypothetical sensitivity analysis of asset return in millions  except percentages better or worse than expected better worse years ending december  projected return return return on investments in primary us pension plan umwa plans projected funded status at december  primary us pension plan umwa plans expense primary us pension plan umwa plans effect of using fair market value of assets to determine expense 
for our defined benefit pension plans  we calculate expected investment returns by applying the expected long term rate of return to the market related value of plan assets 
in addition  our plan asset actuarial gains and losses that are subject to amortization are based on the market related value 
the market related value of the plan assets is different from the actual or fair market value of the assets 
the actual or fair market value is  at a point in time  the value of the assets that is available to make payments to pensioners and to cover any transaction costs 
the market related value recognizes changes in fair value from the expected value on a straight line basis over five years 
this recognition method spreads the effects of year over year volatility in the financial markets over several years 
our expenses related to our primary us pension plan would have been different if our accounting policy were to use the fair market value of plan assets instead of the market related value to recognize investment gains and losses 
in millions based on market related value of assets hypothetical a actual projected projected years ending december  expense income primary us pension plan a assumes that our accounting policy was to use the fair market value of assets instead of the market related value of assets to determine our expense related to our primary us pension plan 
for our umwa plans  we calculate expected investment returns by applying the expected long term rate of return to the fair market value of the assets at the beginning of the year 
this method is likely to cause the expected return on assets  which is recorded in earnings  to fluctuate more than had we used the accounting methodology of our defined benefit pension plans 
medical inflation assumption we estimate the trend in health care cost inflation to predict future cash flows related to our retiree medical plans 
our assumption is based on recent plan experience and industry trends 
for the umwa plans  our largest postretirement plans  we have assumed a medical inflation rate of for  and we project this rate to decline to by the average annual medical inflation rate of the company over the last three years was 
if we had assumed that medical inflation rates were one percentage point higher in each future year  the plan obligation for these plans at december   would have been approximately million higher and the expense for would have been million higher 
if we had assumed that the medical inflation rates were one percentage point lower  the plan obligation at december   would have been approximately million lower and the related expenses would have been million lower 
if we had projected medical inflation rates to decline from to by  instead of our projected decline to by  the plan obligation for the umwa retiree medical benefit plan would have been million higher for and our expense would be million higher for in addition  the patient protection and affordable care act could substantially change the health care and insurance industries in the us  which could increase our costs 
excise tax on administrators by patient protection and affordable care act a excise tax will be imposed on high cost health plans cadillac plans beginning in the tax will apply to plan costs that exceed a certain threshold level for individuals and for families  which will be indexed to inflation 
there will be higher limits for high risk professions  among which is mining 
even though the tax is not assessed directly to an employer but rather to the benefits plan administrator  the cost is expected to be passed through to plan sponsors as higher premiums or higher claims administration fees  increasing the plan sponsor s obligations 
we project that this excise tax will impact our umwa plans and have accordingly included a increase approximately million to our umwa plans obligation 
we are currently unable to reduce the benefit levels of our umwa medical plans to avoid this excise tax because these benefit levels are required by the coal industry retiree health benefit act of black lung the patient protection and affordable care act  which was enacted in march  contains an amendment to the laws governing federal black lung benefits for coal miners 
the amendment creates a presumption that benefits should be awarded to current or former coal miners that have accumulated or more years of coal mine employment if they are able to prove that they have a disabling pulmonary disease 
previously  miners were required to demonstrate that their disabling pulmonary disease was caused by black lung disease  and not by some other cause such as smoking or old age 
under the amendment  the burden of proof becomes the employer s to establish that the disabling pulmonary disease is not black lung disease or that the miner s disease did not result from coal mine employment 
we expect that the amendment may increase the approval rates for coal miners applying to receive black lung benefits  however  the rates have not been significantly affected to date 
we remeasured our black lung obligation as of march   to reflect an estimate of the increase in approval rates as a result of the amendment 
the obligation increased million as a result of the remeasurement  from million before the remeasurement to million 
the liability could change in the future if the approval rates used in the estimates of the liabilities are either too high or too low 
these estimated amounts will change in the future to reflect payments made  actuarial revaluations  and other changes in estimates 
actual amounts could differ materially from the currently estimated amounts 
workers compensation besides the effects of changes in medical costs  worker s compensation costs are affected by the severity and types of injuries  changes in state and federal regulations and their application and the quality of programs which assist an employee s return to work 
our liability for future payments for workers compensation claims is evaluated annually with the assistance of an actuary 
numbers of participants the valuations of all of these benefit plans are affected by the life expectancy of the participants 
accordingly  we rely on actuarial information to predict the number and life expectancy of participants 
we use the following mortality table for our major plans 
plan mortality table umwa plans rp separate  healthy blue collar black lung rp combined annuitant non annuitant blue collar primary us pension rp combined active and retiree  healthy blue collar the number of participants by major plan in the past five years is as follows number of participants plan umwa plans black lung us pension since we are no longer operating in the coal industry  we anticipate that the number of participants in the umwa retirement medical plan will decline over time due to mortality 
since the us pension plan has been frozen  the number of its participants will also decline over time 
foreign currency translation the majority of our subsidiaries outside the us conduct business in their local currencies 
our financials report results in us dollars  which include the results of these subsidiaries 
accounting policy our accounting policy for foreign currency translation is different depending on whether the economy in which our foreign subsidiary operates has been designated as highly inflationary or not 
economies with a three year cumulative inflation rate of more than are considered as highly inflationary 
at the end of  we did not have any subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies 
effective january   we began accounting for our venezuelan subsidiaries as operating in a highly inflationary economy 
non highly inflationary economies assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries in non highly inflationary economies are translated into us dollars using rates of exchange at the balance sheet date 
translation adjustments are recorded in other comprehensive income loss 
revenues and expenses are translated at rates of exchange in effect during the year 
transaction gains and losses are recorded in net income 
highly inflationary economies foreign subsidiaries that operate in highly inflationary countries must use the reporting currency the us dollar as the functional currency 
local currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into dollars each balance sheet date  with remeasurement adjustments and other transaction gains and losses recognized in earnings 
non monetary assets and liabilities do not fluctuate with changes in local currency exchange rates to the dollar 
application of accounting policy venezuela our venezuelan operations constitute a material portion of our overall consolidated operations  and accounted for million or of total brink s revenues in our operating margins in venezuela have varied depending on the mix of business during any year and have been up to three times our overall international segment operating margin rate 
beginning january   we designated venezuela s economy as highly inflationary for accounting purposes  and we consolidated our venezuelan results using our accounting policy for subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies 
since  the venezuelan government has controlled the exchange of local currency into other currencies  including the us dollar 
from to the present the government has maintained an official exchange rate 
the rate is available only for transactions that have been approved by the government s currency control agency  known as cadivi  or if the purpose of the conversion is to purchase goods or services that are on a list of approved items 
the official rate was bolivar fuertes to the dollar in and in january  the official currency was devalued and split into two separate official rates  one for priority items such as food  and another rate for other imports and other purposes 
the ability to exchange funds at either of these rates requires cadivi s approval  unless the purpose of the conversion was to purchase goods or services that were on lists of approved items 
the new rates were and bolivar fuertes to the dollar 
in january  the government eliminated the rate such that the official rate was at a single rate of bolivar fuertes to the dollar 
in addition to the official rate  a parallel market exchange rate was available until a june law disallowed the use of the parallel rate 
prior to june  the parallel rate could be used to convert local cash into dollars 
the average parallel bolivar fuerte to dollar rate was in  in and in the first five months of we remeasured bolivar fuerte denominated net monetary assets at each balance sheet date using the parallel rate until june   when the venezuelan government replaced the parallel rate with a new exchange process that requires each transaction be approved by the government s central bank the sitme rate 
on a daily basis  the central bank publishes ranges of prices at which it may approve transactions to purchase dollar denominated bonds  resulting in an exchange rate range of to bolivar fuertes to the us dollar 
to date  approved transactions have been at the upper end of the range 
to the extent we need to obtain us dollars  we currently expect our us dollar denominated transactions to be settled at a rate of bolivar fuertes to the us dollar 
we have used this rate to remeasure our bolivar fuerte denominated monetary assets and liabilities into us dollars at december   resulting in bolivar fuerte denominated net monetary assets at december   of million 
we did not recognize any remeasurement gains or losses in as the sitme rate did not change 
under the sitme process  approved transactions may not exceed  per legal entity per month 
we believe that we will be able to continue to obtain sufficient us dollars to purchase imported supplies and fixed assets to operate our business in venezuela 
we believe the repatriation of cash invested in venezuela will be limited in the future 
we have also been successful at converting bolivar fuertes to us dollars through other legal channels  at a rate not as favorable as the sitme rate 
at december   our venezuelan subsidiaries held million of cash and short term investments denominated in us dollars and million of cash denominated in bolivar fuertes 
on an equity method basis  we had investments in our venezuelan operations of million at december  recent accounting pronouncements recently adopted accounting standards we adopted the accounting principles established by accounting standards update asu  transfers and servicing accounting for transfers of financial assets  effective january  this asu removes the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity qspe from sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities  and removes the exception from applying financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation r  consolidation of variable interest entities 
this statement also clarifies the requirements for isolation and limitations on portions of financial assets that are eligible for sale accounting 
the adoption of this new guidance did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
we adopted the accounting principles established by asu  consolidations improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities  effective january  this asu requires an ongoing reassessment and replaces the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation for determining which reporting entity  if any  has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity vie with a primarily qualitative analysis 
the qualitative analysis is based on identifying the party that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the vie s economic performance the power criterion and the obligation to absorb losses from or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie the losses benefit criterion 
the party that meets both these criteria is deemed to have a controlling financial interest 
the party with the controlling financial interest is considered to be the primary beneficiary and as a result is required to consolidate the vie 
the adoption of this new guidance did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued asu  improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
asu both expands and clarifies the disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements 
entities are required to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level of the fair value valuation hierarchy and describe the reasons for the transfers 
additionally  entities are required to disclose information about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of level fair value measurements 
the new guidance also clarifies existing fair value measurement disclosure guidance about the level of disaggregation  inputs  and valuation techniques 
we adopted the new disclosures effective january   except for the level rollforward disclosures 
we did not have any significant transfers in and out of level and level of the fair value valuation hierarchy during see note for the required disclosures for a transfer of certain of our fixed rate bonds from level to level in the fair valuation hierarchy 
we adopted the level rollforward disclosures effective january  the adoption of the level disclosures did not have a material effect on our financial statements as the only level valuations were for investments held by our retirement plans 
since these valuations have been estimated using net asset value per share  we are not required to make the level rollforward disclosures required by asu we adopted the accounting principles established by asu  subsequent events amendments to certain recognition and disclosure requirements  effective january  under this amended guidance  sec filers are no longer required to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated in originally issued and revised financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued asu  accounting and reporting for decreases in ownership of a subsidiary a scope clarification  which clarifies the scope of the decrease in ownership provisions of accounting standards codification asc  consolidation  and related guidance 
the asu clarified that the standard applies to a subsidiary or group of assets that is a business  a subsidiary that is a business that is transferred to an equity method investee or joint venture  or an exchange of a group of assets that constitutes a business for a noncontrolling interest in an entity including an equity method investee or joint venture 
the asu also expands the disclosures required upon deconsolidation of a subsidiary to disclose the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of any retained investment in the former subsidiary  the nature of continuing involvement after the former subsidiary has been deconsolidated or derecognized and whether the transaction resulting in deconsolidation was with a related party or if the deconsolidated entity will become a related party 
finally  the asu also requires that entities disclose valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of previously held equity interests prior to acquiring control in a business combination achieved in stages 
we adopted this guidance effective january  the adoption of this new guidance did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued asu  foreign currency issues multiple foreign currency exchange rates  which codified an sec staff announcement made at the march   emerging issues task force eitf meeting 
the staff announcement provides the sec staff s view on certain exchange rates related to investments in venezuela 
the use of different rates for remeasurement and translation purposes causes venezuelan reported balances for financial reporting purposes and the actual us dollar denominated balances to be different 
the sec staff indicated that any differences between the amounts reported for financial reporting purposes and actual us dollar denominated balances that may have existed prior to the application of the highly inflationary accounting requirements january   for calendar year end registrants including brink s should be recognized in the income statement  unless the issuer can document that the difference was previously recognized as a cumulative translation adjustment  in which case the difference should be recognized as a currency translation adjustment 
we adopted the guidance effective march    and recognized these differences as a currency translation adjustment as of january   upon the adoption of highly inflationary accounting in venezuela 
see related disclosures in note in december  the fasb ratified eitf g  disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations 
eitf g affects public entities that have entered into material business combinations and requires that pro forma disclosures reflect the assumption that the business combination had occurred as of the beginning of the prior annual period 
it also requires a description of nonrecurring pro forma adjustments 
eitf g is effective and should be applied prospectively for business combinations completed during periods beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
we were required to adopt the new rule in  but we early adopted this standard for acquisitions occurring in the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
we adopted the accounting principles established by asu  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  effective january  asu establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable in a multiple deliverable arrangement 
in addition  the revised guidance requires additional disclosures about the methods and assumptions used to evaluate multiple deliverable arrangements and to identify the significant deliverables within those arrangements 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
we adopted the accounting principles established by asu  certain revenue arrangements that include software elements  effective january  asu amends asc topic to exclude from its scope tangible products that contain both software and non software components that function together to deliver a product s essential functionality 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued asu  testing goodwill for impairment 
under the revised guidance  entities testing goodwill for impairment have the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the reporting unit ie  step of the goodwill impairment test 
if entities determine  on the basis of qualitative factors  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount  the two step impairment test would be required 
the asu also requires that the same qualitative factors be considered when determining whether an interim test of goodwill impairment is necessary and for determining whether it is necessary to perform step for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
the option to carry forward an entity s detailed calculation of fair value of the reporting unit if certain conditions were met has been removed 
although the asu is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   we adopted this guidance for the reporting year for our annual october goodwill impairment test 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
standards not yet adopted in may  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurement amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs  which became effective for us on january  asu changes how fair value guidance is applied in certain circumstances and expands the disclosure requirements around fair value measurements 
for entities with fair value measurements classified as level  required disclosures include a quantitative disclosure of the unobservable inputs and assumptions used in the measurement  a description of the valuation processes in place  a narrative description of the sensitivity of the fair value to changes in unobservable inputs and interrelationships between those inputs  and quantitative disclosures about unobservable inputs used in fair value measurements other than those valuations that use net asset value as a practical expedient 
the adoption of this guidance will not have a material effect on our financial statements but may increase the disclosures related to our level fair value measurements 
in june  the fasb issued asu  presentation of comprehensive income  which became effective for us on january  under asu  an entity has the option to present the components of comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the asu does not change the items that must be reported as other comprehensive income 
whether presenting two separate statements or one continuous statement  the asu required entities to present reclassifications from other comprehensive income in the statement reporting net income 
in december  however  the fasb deferred this requirement when it issued asu  deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassification of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 
 which has the same effective date as asu companies must continue to disclose reclassifications from other comprehensive income on the statement that reports other comprehensive income  or in the notes to the financial statements 
we have determined that the standards will not affect our annual financial statements 
however  we will be required to include a statement of comprehensive income in our quarterly financial statements beginning in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we currently serve customers in more than countries  including approximately countries where we operate subsidiaries 
these operations expose us to a variety of market risks  including the effects of changes in interest rates  commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
these financial and commodity exposures are monitored and managed by us as an integral part of its overall risk management program 
we periodically use various derivative and non derivative financial instruments  as discussed below  to hedge our interest rate  commodity prices and foreign currency exposures when appropriate 
the risk that counterparties to these instruments may be unable to perform is minimized by limiting the counterparties used to major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings 
we do not expect to incur a loss from the failure of any counterparty to perform under the agreements 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for purposes other than hedging underlying financial or commercial exposures 
the sensitivity analyses discussed below for the market risk exposures were based on the facts and circumstances in effect at december  actual results will be determined by a number of factors that are not under management s control and could vary materially from those disclosed 
interest rate risk we use both fixed and floating rate debt and leases to finance our operations 
floating rate obligations  including our revolving facility  expose us to fluctuations in cash flows due to changes in the general level of interest rates 
fixed rate obligations  including our dominion terminal associates debt and our unsecured notes  are subject to fluctuations in fair values as a result of changes in interest rates 
based on the contractual interest rates on the floating rate debt at december   a hypothetical increase in rates would increase cash outflows by approximately million over a twelve month period 
in other words  our weighted average interest rate on our floating rate instruments was per annum at december  if that average rate were to increase by percentage points to  the cash outflows associated with these instruments would increase by million annually 
the effect on the fair values on our dominion terminal associates dta debt and on our unsecured notes for a hypothetical decrease in the yield curve from year end levels would result in a million increase for our dta debt and a million increase for our unsecured notes in the fair values of the debt 
foreign currency risk we have exposure to the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the results of all of our foreign operations 
our foreign operations generally use local currencies to conduct business but their results are reported in us dollars 
our business in venezuela represents approximately of our revenues 
currently  venezuela operates in a highly inflationary economy and its currency is fixed to the us dollar 
however  there is a risk that the venezuelan government will devalue the local currency in the future  which would reduce the value of our business and result in the recognition of a loss 
the investment in our venezuelan subsidiaries  and cash and other monetary assets held by these subsidiaries are as follows december  in millions equity method investment in venezuelan subsidiaries a net monetary assets held by our venezuelan subsidiaries cash and short term investments denominated in us dollars net monetary assets denominated in bolivar fuertes cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable  accounts payable and other  net total a the amount represents retained earnings net of currency translation adjustments of the business 
we are exposed periodically to the foreign currency rate fluctuations that affect transactions not denominated in the functional currency of domestic and foreign operations 
to mitigate these exposures  we  from time to time  enter into foreign currency forward and swap contracts 
at december   the notional value of our outstanding foreign currency contracts was million with average contract maturities of less than one month 
the foreign currency contracts primarily offset exposures in the mexican peso and the euro 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge investments in foreign subsidiaries since such investments are long term in nature 
the effects of a hypothetical simultaneous appreciation in the us dollar from year end levels against all other currencies of countries in which we have continuing operations are as follows hypothetical effects in millions increase decrease effect on earnings translation of earnings into us dollars transaction gains losses effect on other comprehensive income loss translation of net assets of foreign subsidiaries the hypothetical foreign currency effects above detail the consolidated effect attributable to brink s of a simultaneous change in the value of a large number of foreign currencies relative to the u 
s 
dollar 
the foreign currency exposure effect related to a change in an individual currency could be significantly different
