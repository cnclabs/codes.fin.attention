item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that are based on management s current expectation  estimates  and projections about our business and operations 
our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward looking statements as a result of numerous factors  including those we discuss under risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview general we are a leader in planning and delivering clean energy solutions that assist our clients in the achievement of their energy efficiency and renewable energy goals 
we operate in three specific markets the utility market  the public sector and institutional market and the commercial and industrial market 
we perform energy efficiency engineering and consulting as well as the development and implementation of energy efficient lighting  mechanical  electrical  water  weatherization  on site power generation and renewable energy solutions 
we serve a wide range of utility  public sector and institutional and commercial and industrial clients 
we work for utilities and public utility commissions where we manage or operate their energy demand side management programs typically targeted at their small business and or municipal customers 
our public sector clients include federal  state and local government agencies and educational institutions  which we serve through our relationships with escos and directly 
escos are awarded project contracts with public sector clients  we assist the escos by providing energy efficiency expertise to develop and implement tailored solutions under these contracts 
in addition we also work directly for public sector clients when the services of an esco are not required 
we also serve larger  national commercial and industrial clients including many fortune companies for which we provide our energy efficiency solutions directly 
our revenue increased by million  or  to million during from million during the services we provide include energy consulting and technical services we apply our engineering expertise to analyze each client s energy consumption and operational needs and develop customized energy efficiency and renewable energy solutions 
our energy engineering and consulting services include sustainability consulting  energy auditing  energy master planning  project development services  design engineering and facility retro commissioning 
we also provide design review and analysis of new construction projects to maximize energy efficiency and sustainability  project management of energy related construction  and processing and procurement of incentive and rebate applications 
implementation we provide complete turnkey implementation services for a range of energy efficiency and renewable energy projects  including energy efficient lighting upgrades  energy efficiency mechanical and electrical retrofit and upgrade services  water conservation  weatherization  combined heat and power or cogeneration and renewable project development and implementation  including solar  biomass and geothermal 
we consider factors such as current facility infrastructure  best available technologies  building environmental conditions  hours of operation  energy costs  available utility rebates  tax incentives  and installation  
table of contents operation and maintenance costs of various efficiency alternatives 
our professionals extensive knowledge in energy solutions enables us to apply the most appropriate  effective and proven technologies available in the marketplace 
utility program management we assist our utility and public utility commission clients in the attainment of energy efficiency goals and provide targeted relief of transmission and distribution constrained load pockets through a single point solution 
our wide range of services include program design  program management  marketing customer recruitment  auditing and installation of energy conservation measures targeted primarily toward the utility s small business and small municipal clients 
energy asset development and management we leverage our engineering  implementation and project finance experience and capabilities to provide energy asset development and management services to our clients who wish to benefit from using or investing in alternative and or renewable energy sources 
in this role we serve two sets of clients the energy consumer and investors 
for the energy consumer  we perform project feasibility assessments  evaluate alternative technologies  estimate economic returns  arrange debt and equity financing  manage the design and construction process  and operate the asset under a long term power purchase agreement 
for our investor clients  we source  qualify and structure projects to maximize risk adjusted returns  then manage the design and construction process and operate the assets under long term power purchase agreements 
in august  we sold our energy technology segment through which we offered our patented line of hvac and lighting controllers under the emac and umac brand names 
the emac technology provides remote monitoring  management and control of commercial rooftop hvac units 
in early we decided to sell this division  which had incurred significant losses  to allow us to focus on our faster growing energy services business 
we came to agreement with a buyer in early august and closed on the sale on august  this segment has been reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements 
revenue and expense components revenue we generate the majority of our revenue from the sale of our services and the products that we purchase and resell to our clients 
revenue includes charges for our engineering  installation and or project management services and the materials we purchase and resell to our customers 
the substantial majority of our revenue is derived from fixed price contracts  although we occasionally bill on a time and materials basis 
under fixed price contracts  we bill our clients for each project once the project is completed or throughout the project as specified in the contract 
under time and materials arrangements  we bill our clients on an hourly basis with material costs and other reimbursable expenses passed through and recognized as revenue 
the time it takes to complete our projects ranges from less than a day for a small project under a utility program to over a year for some of our larger projects 
our revenues are somewhat seasonal with the strongest sales occurring in the second half of the year 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize our revenue when all four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence has been received that an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the products and or services has occurred  iii the selling price is fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
in addition  we follow the provisions of the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  which sets forth guidelines in the timing of revenue recognition based upon factors such as passage of title  installation  payments and client acceptance 
any amounts received prior to satisfying our revenue recognition criteria are recorded as billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts 
we recognize the revenue utilizing the percentage of completion method or revenue recognition 
under the percentage of completion method we recognize revenue throughout the term of the project based on the percentage of costs incurred 
any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to operations as soon as they are determinable 
revenue concentration during  one utility customer accounted for approximately of our consolidated billings while a public utility commission  the army corps 
of engineers and an esco combined to account for an additional of our consolidated billings 
one utility customer accounted for approximately of our consolidated billings during  while two esco customers accounted for approximately of the consolidated billings during we expect that contracts with large utilities or public utility commissions and escos will continue to be a significant and growing source of revenue for us in the future  therefore we may experience greater client concentration in future periods than we have in the past 
gross profit gross profit equals our revenue less cost of sales 
our cost of sales consists primarily of materials  our internal labor and the cost of subcontracted labor 
gross profit is a key metric that we use to examine our performance 
gross profit depends in part on the volume and mix of products and services that we sell during any given period 
a portion of our cost of sales is relatively fixed 
accordingly  an increase in the volume of sales will generally result in an increase to our gross profit margins since these fixed expenses are not expected to increase proportionately with sales 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense includes the following components direct labor and commission costs related to our employee sales force  expenses related to our management  supervisory and staff salaries and employee benefits  including the costs of stock based compensation  costs related to insurance  travel and entertainment  office supplies and utilities  costs related to marketing and advertising our products  legal and accounting expenses  and costs related to administrative functions that serve to support our existing businesses  as well as to provide the infrastructure for future growth 

table of contents amortization of intangibles when we acquire other companies we are required to allocate the purchase price between identifiable tangible and intangible assets  with any remaining value allocated to goodwill 
the value allocated to intangible assets is amortized over the estimated life of the related asset 
the acquisitions we completed within  and resulted in approximately million of intangible assets that are being amortized over periods ranging from month to years 
approximately million of these assets were determined to have indefinite lives and were not being amortized 
we determined during that this indefinite lived asset  which was comprised of the parke trade name  was impaired due to our decision to operate all of our businesses under the lime energy name 
as a result  we incurred a one time  million non cash impairment charge during the fourth quarter of when we reduced this intangible asset s value to we recorded total amortization expense of   and million in each of the years ended december   and  respectively 
based on the value of the intangible assets we are currently carrying  we expect to record amortization expense of  and  during and  respectively 
interest expense  net net interest expense consists of interest expense net of interest income 
net interest expense represents the interest costs associated with our subordinated convertible term notes including amortization of the related debt discount and issuance costs  our lines of credit  the mortgage on our headquarters building  our term notes and various vehicle loans 
during late  we repaid all of our then outstanding debt with the exception of our mortgage and vehicle loans 
the mortgage was repaid in october  and in november  we entered into a million term loan to finance the construction of the zemel road landfill gas to electricity facility 
interest income includes earnings on our invested cash balances and amortization of the discount on our long term receivables 
preferred stock dividends preferred stock dividends represent the dividend expense associated with our formerly outstanding convertible preferred stock 
all of the convertible preferred stock was converted into common stock in august general business trends and recent developments the trends  events  and uncertainties set out in this section have been identified as those we believe are reasonably likely to materially affect the comparison of historical operating results reported in this report to either other past period results or to future operating results 
these trends  events and uncertainties include rapid growth in our utility and direct federal markets during we began marketing our services to two new markets the utility market and direct federal market  through the army corps of engineers frr program 
while sales into these new markets did not contribute significantly to our consolidated results in  combined they represented more than of our consolidated revenue and of our consolidated revenue 
while our experience in both markets is still somewhat limited  we believe that the combined effect of the growth in these markets is likely to contribute to a reduction in the seasonality of our revenue 
the gross margin earned on revenue under the frr program is much lower than the margins earned in other markets  but this has been somewhat offset by lower sg a expense required to support sales in this market 
the margins earned in the utility market appear to be a little stronger than those earned in some of our existing markets  though the sg a expense associated with this market will be more difficult to leverage than 
table of contents that what we have been able to achieve in some of our other markets 
the combination of these factors  as each of these markets continues to grow at different rates is likely to reduce the value of our historical results as an indicator of our future performance 
recent restructuring sales to c i customers have been difficult for the past couple of years  due largely to the general economic conditions and uncertainty on the part of our c i clients regarding the outlook for their businesses 
these conditions contributed to a decline in our revenue from c i clients during when compared to sensing that this market was not going to perform up to our expectations  in may we took steps to better align costs related to this market to our reduced sales expectations 
at the same time we also took steps to better integrate and streamline the entire organization with the goal of reducing costs and improving performance 
as a result  we incurred a restructuring charge of million during  primarily related to severance costs and real estate related costs 
at the same time we also promoted our coo  john o rourke  to be our president and ceo 
we believe that these changes have reduced our overhead costs by approximately million on an annual basis from what they would have been had we not implemented them 
the restructuring also greatly reduced our dependence on c i clients  while reducing the overhead associated with this market so that it can be profitable at a much lower revenue level 
aem transaction on june   we acquired aem 
aem provides energy engineering and consulting services and energy efficiency services similar to our then existing energy efficiency lighting solutions 
in addition  it provides mechanical and electrical conservation services  water conservation services and renewable energy solutions primarily for government and municipal facilities  all markets that we had not previously participated in 
at that time  the majority of aem s clients were escos and it operated primarily on the east coast 
because of the significance of this acquisition  our historical operating results prior to june were not indicative of our subsequent operating results 
the acquisition of aem has helped to reduce the seasonality of our consolidated revenue because aem derived the majority of its revenue from long term government contracts that are generally not seasonal in nature 
however  because a few large projects are often responsible for a significant portion of revenue from long term government contracts  the level of activity  initial project delays or gaps between projects can have a significant impact on the revenue and earnings of a particular period 
asset development in october  we acquired the gas rights to the zemel road landfill in punta gorda  florida  for million and completed construction of a megawatt landfill gas to electricity generating facility on the site in october and began selling the output to a local utility under a year power purchase agreement 
please see note in the accompanying financial statements for additional information regarding this investment 
we made this investment to establish ourselves as a provider of asset development and management services because we believe being able to offer those services will differentiate us with potential customers and expand the scale and scope of the projects we work on 
we also believe that this investment will generate consistent long term revenue and earnings and deliver a strong return to our stockholders 
going forward we plan to focus our asset development and management efforts on serving as a developer and asset manager for third party investors and intend to limit our future investment in similar assets 
in this role we will earn fees for developing and managing assets owned by third party investors 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that involve significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenues  bad debts  warranty accrual  income taxes and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue and profit recognition historically  we have recognized a portion of our revenue on a completed contract basis 
under the completed contract method  revenue is recognized once the project is substantially complete  resulting in some variability in revenue 
this method is most appropriate for use with projects that are smaller and shorter in duration 
our public sector markets  however  recognize all of its revenue on a percentage of completion basis 
projects in our public sector market are generally larger in terms of revenue and longer in duration  therefore we recognized revenue throughout the term of the project on a completion method based on the percentage of costs incurred 
the consolidation of systems and accounting activities in permitted us to better make and monitor estimates that are sufficiently dependable to justify the use of the percentage of completion method of accounting 
therefore during  we began accounting for all of our projects on a percentage of completion basis 
under both methods of revenue recognition  any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to operations as soon as they are determinable 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to make required payments 
the allowance is largely based upon specific knowledge of clients from whom collection is determined to be doubtful and our historical collection experience with such clients 
if the financial condition of our clients or the economic environment in which they operate were to deteriorate  resulting in an inability to make payments  or if our estimates of certain clients ability to pay are incorrect  additional allowances may be required 
during we increased our allowance by  and wrote off receivables of  as of december   our allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately  or of our outstanding accounts receivable 

table of contents amortization of intangibles we account for acquisitions of companies in accordance with asc  accounting for business combinations 
we allocate the purchase price to tangible assets and intangible assets based on their fair values  with the excess of purchase price being allocated to goodwill 
the determination of the fair values of these intangible assets is based on a number of significant assumptions as determined by us  including evaluations of the future income producing capabilities of these assets and related future expected cash flows or replacement cost of the asset 
we also make estimates about the useful lives of the acquired intangible assets 
should different conditions result in the determination that the value of the acquired intangible assets has been impaired  we could incur write downs of intangible assets  or changes in the estimation of useful lives of those intangible assets 
in accordance with asc  goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized  but is subject to annual impairment testing which is discussed in greater detail below 
intangible assets included acquired technology and software  customer and contractual relationships  trade names and gas rights 
acquired technology was initially recorded at its fair value based on the estimated after tax cost to replace the asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life on a straight line basis 
customer and contractual relationships represent contractual and separable relationships that we have with certain customers and partners 
these contractual relationships were initially recorded at their fair value based on the present value of expected future cash flows of the contractual relationships and are amortized over their estimated useful life 
trade name intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value based on the present value of the royalty payments that would need to be paid for the development and use of a comparable trade name should the name be unavailable to us 
trade name intangible assets were deemed to have an indeterminate life and are not amortized 
the gas rights intangible assets are being amortized over the term of the gas rights agreement  which is years 
impairment loss we evaluate all of our long lived assets  including intangible assets other than goodwill and fixed assets  periodically for impairment in accordance with asc  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those items 
our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value 
our estimates of fair value represent our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 
during  we determined that the parke trade name was impaired as a result of our decision to operate the business under the lime energy name 
as a result we incurred an impairment loss of million  net of the tax benefit  during the fourth quarter of goodwill we have made acquisitions in the past that included a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with asc  goodwill is subject to an annual or under certain circumstances more frequent impairment test based on its estimated fair value 
estimated fair value is less than value based on undiscounted operating earnings because fair value estimates include a discount factor in valuing future cash flows 
many assumptions and estimates underlie the determination of an impairment loss  including economic and competitive conditions  operating costs and efficiencies 
another estimate using different  but still reasonable  assumptions could produce a significantly different result 

table of contents during the fourth quarter of we completed our analyses for the c i and aem reporting units and concluded that the implied fair value of the aem reporting unit based on the discounted current value of the estimated future cash flows substantially exceeded the carrying value  indicating that the goodwill was not impaired 
however  due to a significant decline in the performance of the c i reporting unit during  we determined that the fair value of its goodwill had declined to  as a result  we reduced the carrying value of the goodwill from million to  incurring a million impairment loss during the period 
we considered various factors in determining the fair value of the testing units  including discounted cash flows from projected earnings  values for comparable companies and the market price of our common stock 
we will continue to monitor for any impairment indicators such as underperformance of projected earnings  net book value compared to market capitalization  declining stock price and significant adverse economic and industry trends 
in the event that either testing unit does not achieve projected results  or  as the result of changes in facts of circumstances  we could incur an additional goodwill impairment charge in a future period 
share based compensation we have stock incentive plans that provides for stock based employee and director compensation  including the granting of stock options and shares of restricted stock  to certain key employees and non employee directors 
these plans are more fully described in notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
consistent with asc  share based payment  we record stock compensation expense for equity based awards granted  including stock options and restricted stock unit grants  over the service period of the equity based award based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant 
we recognized million  million and million of stock compensation related to employee options expense  employee stock purchase plan and restricted stock grants during  and  respectively 
results of operations revenue we generate the majority of our revenue from the sale of our services as well as the sale of the products that we purchase and resell to our clients 
substantially all of our revenue is earned in the united states 
our revenue includes charges for our engineering  installation and or project management services and the materials we purchase and resell to our clients 
the substantial majority of our revenue is derived from fixed price contracts  although we occasionally bill on a time and materials basis 
under fixed price contracts  we bill our clients for each project once the project is completed or throughout the project as specified in the contract 
under time and materials arrangements  we bill our clients on an hourly basis with material costs and other reimbursable expenses passed through and recognized as revenue 
the time it takes to complete are projects range from less than one day for some of our utility program projects to over a year for some of our largest public sector projects 

table of contents gross profit gross profit equals our revenue less costs of sales 
the cost of sales consists primarily of materials  our internal labor  including engineering  and the cost of subcontracted labor 
gross profit is a key metric that we use to examine our performance 
gross profit depends in part on the volume and mix of products and services that we sell during any given period 
a portion of our expenses are relatively fixed 
accordingly  an increase in the volume of sales will generally result in an increase to our margins since these fixed expenses are not expected to increase proportionately with sales 
our business is also seasonal  as such  our margins will vary with seasonal changes in our revenue due to the fixed nature of some of our costs 
the gross margin earned in our different markets varies  with our direct federal market generating the lowest margins and our utility market generally earning the highest margins 
therefore the mix of business generated from our various markets  which will change throughout the year due in part to the seasonal nature and growth in some of the markets  will affect our consolidated gross margin 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a include the following components direct labor and commission costs related to our employee sales force  costs of our management  supervisory and staff salaries and employee benefits  including the costs of stock based compensation  costs related to insurance  travel and entertainment  office supplies and utilities  costs related to marketing and advertising our products  legal and accounting expenses  and costs related to administrative functions that serve to support our existing businesses  as well as to provide the infrastructure for future growth 
amortization of intangibles we incur expenses related to the amortization of identifiable assets that we have capitalized in connection with our acquisitions 
other expense other expense consists of interest expense  net of interest earned on our investments 
interest expense represents the interest costs and fees associated with our subordinated convertible term notes including amortization of the related debt discount and issuance costs  our lines of credit  the mortgage on our headquarters building  term notes and various vehicle loans 
interest income includes earnings on our invested cash balances and amortization of the discount on our long term receivables 
we offer certain customers extended payment terms 
when we record these receivables we are required to discount them using a market rate of interest and amortize the discount over the term of the receivable 
this amortization is recognized as interest income

twelve month period ended december  compared with the twelve month period ended december  consolidated results twelve months ended change revenue cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative amortization of intangibles restructuring charge impairment loss operating loss total other income net loss the following table presents the percentage of certain items to revenue twelve months ended revenue cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative amortization of intangibles restructuring charge impairment loss operating loss total other income net loss 
table of contents revenue our revenue for the twelve month period ended december   increased million  or  to million from million for the same period during revenue from our utility clients  the frr contract and our public sector clients increased approximately  and  respectively  during  as a result of new contracts in these areas 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in revenue from our c i clients 
the economic environment during continued to cause many of our c i clients to postpone decisions to move forward with significant projects 
revenue from our c i clients in banking  an industry that has been responsible for a significant portion of our c i revenue in prior years  saw significant contraction during we currently do not expect to see significant improvement in this market before we expect revenue from our utility clients to continue to grow as we start to realize contributions from contracts that we have recently won 
we started with two utility contracts  but ended the year with four contracts and have added two additional  smaller contracts in early we continue to seek to add additional contracts in this area and believe that we are in a good position to renew the existing contracts that are scheduled to expire later this year 
revenue from our public sector and institutional clients is expected to continue to grow during as many of the projects we have under contract or in development are expected to move forward during the year 
this market continues to benefit from strong interest by federal and state agencies in energy savings performance contract espc programs sponsored by the us department of energy and various state agencies 
we have won four contracts under the army corps 
of engineers frr program over the past two years  worth approximately million 
however  the number of contracts being put out to bid under the program has declined significantly as funds have been shifted to other priorities within the military 
we are therefore uncertain about future opportunities under this program beyond the remaining term of the contracts we are currently working on 
the decline of this revenue source will not have a significant impact on our earnings as the margins on these contracts are very low relative to our other markets 
one of the primary reasons for entering the frr program was to develop a track record as a federal government contractor  which we have done 
we believe that this will permit us to bid directly on federal energy efficiency contacts that don t require the services of an esco  which we hope will eventually replace the revenue generated by the frr program 
our asset development activities contributed revenue of approximately thousand during from the startup of the zemel road generating facility 
we expect zemel road will generate revenue of approximately million to million during we are pursuing a number of asset development opportunities  some of which we hope will close during  contributing fee revenue and potentially engineering and construction revenue 
while we expect our quarterly revenue will be higher during on a year over year basis  we expect between and of our revenue will continue to be earned during the second half of the year  with revenue peaking during the fourth quarter as it has for the last several years 
gross profit our gross profit increased million  or  to million during the twelve months ended december   when compared to the million earned during our gross profit margin declined from in to in this decline was largely due to a decline in the gross profit earned from our c i market and a decline in the gross profit margin earned from 
table of contents this market 
the combined gross profit earned from our other markets increased  while the combined gross margin earned by other markets increased 
the decline in the gross profit and gross margin earned from sales in the c i market was due to a combination of lower revenue and increased competition for a smaller pool of available business within this market 
during  many of our larger c i clients  particularly banking clients  deferred significant retrofit projects  as a result most of our revenue from this market was derived from smaller  regional clients where we had to compete with local contractors willing to accept lower margins in order to win the work 
we have decided that in the future we will not pursue work from these smaller customers except through our utility program management business  where we have a unique offering 
growth from some of our higher margin markets is expected to result in a favorable change in the mix of our business during  which we expect will contribute to an increase on our gross margins for the year 
however  our gross margins will continue to vary throughout the year depending on the mix of revenue and overall revenue level  with the highest margins expected in the third and fourth quarters when revenues are expected to peak 
selling  general administrative expense our sg a expense increased million  or  to million during the twelve months ended december  from million during the year earlier period 
sg a as a percent of revenue declined from in to in  as sg a expense grew at a slower rate than revenue 
the million increase in sg a expense during was primarily driven by higher expense associated with our utility program management and asset development businesses  partially offset by lower sg a expense from our c i market and corporate overhead 
sg a expense for the utility program management business increased at a slightly slower rate than the increase in revenue for this business as we staffed up for the new long island power contract and expanded the national grid and new jersey direct programs 
generally growth in revenue under utilities programs will be accompanied by slightly slower growth in associated sg a expense 
our asset development activities were new in  so the increase in sg a for asset development was the result of inclusion of a full year of expense as well as an expansion of our marketing efforts in this area 
sg a expense for our c i market and corporate overhead for declined by approximately million when compared to levels 
these savings were largely due to the restructuring implemented in the middle of this restructuring is expected to reduce sg a expense from these two areas by approximately million during from the levels they would have been without the changes implemented as part of the restructuring 
we expect total sg a expense to increase at a faster rate during than it did in  due largely to the expected growth in our utility management services 
however  we expect the rate of growth to remain well below the expected rate of growth in revenue  contributing to further declines in sg a as a percent of revenue during the year 
amortization of intangibles amortization expense increased thousand  to thousand during  from thousand during the increase was due to a scheduled increase in the amortization of certain intangibles associated with the acquisition of applied energy management  and to the inclusion of amortization of the zemel road gas rights 
amortization expense is expected to total thousand during with the increase due to the inclusion of a full year of amortization of the zemel road gas rights 

table of contents restructuring charge during  we initiated a restructuring to reduce costs  streamline our organization and better integrate our operations 
as part of this we moved our corporate headquarters to huntersville  north carolina  sold our building in elk grove village  illinois and consolidated certain accounting and administrative functions in huntersville 
in connection with this restructuring we incurred a restructuring charge of approximately million consisting primarily of severance related costs and costs associated with the sale of our building 
included in the million charge is approximately thousand of non cash share based compensation expense incurred when the vesting of equity based compensation was accelerated due to involuntary terminations 
impairment loss during the fourth quarter of we completed an analysis of our c i reporting unit and determined  that due to the significant decline its performance  that the value of its goodwill had declined to  to reduce the carrying value of its goodwill from million  we recorded a million  non cash impairment loss

we repaid our mortgage in october  which resulted in the decline in the mortgage interest expense during the period 
during  we deferred certain costs associated with the issuance of the term loan and our line of credit 
these costs are being amortized over the terms of the associated debt 
during  we recognized thousand of amortization expense 

table of contents in december  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to fix the interest rate on million of the million term note 
this interest rate swap was not designated for hedge accounting under asc  therefore we record changes in its fair value as non operating interest income or expense with an offsetting entry to a swap asset or swap liability 
during the year ended december   we recorded expense of thousand due to a decline in the fair market value of this interest rate swap 
our interest income decreased thousand to thousand during from thousand during approximately thousand of the interest income was amortization of the discount on our long term receivables  a decrease of thousand  or  from the thousand recognized during the balance of the decrease in interest income was due to lower average invested balances during the period

both of these were new business initiatives we began in late and neither of them generated significant revenue during revenue generated by our c i and public sector markets were flat to down slightly during when compared to our c i markets were soft early in  as customers continued to appear reluctant to make significant expenditures 
however  conditions seemed to have improved later in the year resulting in strong fourth quarter sales  permitting this market s full year revenue to almost match results 
our public sector clients were impacted early in by customer uncertainty regarding funding sources 
this situation was resolved by mid year and revenue for the third and fourth quarters of the year exceeded the levels earned during the same periods in however  poor weather during december in the northeast and midwest impacted several of our larger projects contributing to revenue for the full year falling short of the levels achieved during

table of contents whether cash is consumed or generated by operating activities is a function of the profitability of our operations and changes in working capital 
to get a better understanding of cash sources and uses  management splits the cash used or provided by operating activities into two pieces the cash consumed or generated by operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities  and the cash consumed or generated from changes in assets and liabilities 
by splitting the cash used or provided by operating activities this way our management believes it gets a better understanding of how much of our operating cash flow is the result of the company s current period cash earnings or loss and how much of our operating cash flow is due to changes in working capital 
these two measures are calculated as follows in thousands year ended year ended december  december  net loss provision for bad debts share based compensation depreciation and amortization amortization of deferred financing costs issuance of warrants in exchange for services received loss on disposition of fixed assets goodwill impairment cash consumed by operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities changes in assets and liabilities  net of business acquisitions and dispositions accounts receivable inventories costs in excess uncompleted contracts prepaid expenses and other current assets accounts payable accrued expenses billings in excess uncompleted contracts other current liabilities cash consumed from changes in assets and liabilities

during the first two quarters of  operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities consumed cash  while operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities generated cash during the last two quarters of the year as revenue increased on a seasonal basis 
we believe that continued growth in our revenue  in combination with an improvement in our gross margin and continued reductions in our sg a as a percentage of revenue will result in cash being generated by operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities during on a full year basis 
cash consumed from changes in assets and liabilities increased million  or  to million during the twelve months ended december   from million consumed during the twelve months ended december  the levels of these assets and liabilities are influenced by many factors  the most significant of which is typically the level of business activity 
due to a combination of factors  including the start up of the long island power authority contract  pushes by our utility customers to meet year end goals and project delays earlier in the year  our revenue in december was higher than it was in december this spike in year end revenue contributed to the increase in working capital at the end of we expect that our working capital needs will continue to grow as our business grows  however we also believe that our revenue will be slightly less seasonal during that it was in due to the maturing of some of our utility contracts  which should help to reduce the variability in our working capital balances throughout the year 
we remain focused on improving our processes so that we can keep the growth in our working capital to a rate that is less than the expected rate of growth in our revenue 
investing activities cash used in investing activities declined million  or  to million during the year ended december   compared to using million during the same period during during  we used million to purchase equipment  compared to using million in to purchase equipment and the zemel road gas rights

financing activities financing activities generated cash of million during compared to consuming cash of thousand during during  we received million from a term loan used to finance a portion of the cost of the zemel road landfill gas to electricity facility  and thousand from the issuance of shares of our stock under employee benefit plans 
this was partially offset by thousand used to repay the mortgage on a building we sold and other scheduled debt payments  and thousand of debt issuance costs 
during  we used thousand for schedule principal payments on our debt and received thousand from the issuance of shares of our stock under employee benefit plans 
for  we expect to use thousand for scheduled principal payments on our debt

the new business initiatives begun during and generally have lower working capital requirements than previously existing businesses 
this  in combination with improvements in our receivables turnover at our existing businesses  was the primary contributors to the improvement in this measure 
investing activities cash consumed by investing activities increased million to million during  from million during approximately million of this increase was related to the acquisition of the gas rights to the zemel road landfill and costs to construct the generating facility on that site 
the balance of the fixed asset purchases during were for computers  software and office equipment  primarily in support of our new business initiatives

we also received thousand from the issuance of shares under our employee stock purchase plan  thousand on the exercise of certain options and warrants and thousand through the financing of vehicle purchases 

table of contents sources of liquidity our primary sources of liquidity are our available cash reserves and availability under our million line of credit 
in addition  on september   we filed a shelf registration on form s with the sec for the issuance of up to million in equity securities 
the registration statement was declared effective on october  this shelf registration gives us the ability to issue shares of our common stock  preferred stock  warrants and or units that combine common stock or preferred stock with warrants over the next three years 
proceeds from the sale of these securities may be used for general corporate purposes including  among other things  working capital  financings  possible acquisitions  the repayment of obligations that have matured  and reducing or refinancing indebtedness that may be outstanding at the time of any offering 
while we do not currently intend to  nor expect to need to  issue additional equity under this shelf registration  it does provide us with the ability to raise capital in the future when needed or otherwise considered appropriate and provides additional comfort to our surety and lenders helping to ensure continued access to surety bonds and various sources of debt 
there can be no assurance  however  that were we to use the shelf registration to issue securities  we would be able to find buyers for those securities at an acceptable price  or at all 
our ability to continue to expand the sales of our products and services will require the continued commitment of significant funds 
the actual timing and amount of our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including the amount  timing and profitability of future revenues  working capital requirements  the level and amount of product marketing and sales efforts  among other things 
we have raised a significant amount of capital since our formation through the issuance of shares of our common and preferred stock and notes  which has allowed us to acquire companies and to continue to execute our business plan 
most of these funds have been consumed by operating activities  either to fund our losses or for working capital requirements 
while our operations generated positive cash flow during the second halves of and and positive earnings during the fourth quarter of and third and fourth quarters of  we need to continue to focus on moving the company to the point that it is consistently generating positive earnings and cash flow 
to do this we believe that we need to continue to increase our revenue while controlling the growth of our sg a expense and maintaining or improving our gross margins 
we believe the strategies we have implemented over the past couple years have positioned us where this objective could be achieved within the next months 
we believe that our current liquidity will be sufficient to permit us to continue to operate until we reach the point that we turn cash flow positive on a consistent basis
