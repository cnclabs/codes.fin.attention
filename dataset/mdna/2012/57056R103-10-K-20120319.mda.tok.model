current year overview market leader s revenues grew in  driven by the strength of our software as a service products and the addition of revenue from our acquisitions of activerain and sharperagent 
during we significantly increased the number of real estate professionals that utilize our software platform to more than  from  at the beginning of the year  driven primarily by the addition of new customers from our relationship with keller williams realty international keller williams 
our goal is to return the company to profitable growth over time  and we believe that to do so requires continued investment in profitable customer acquisition to drive and sustain revenue growth 
our strategy includes initiatives to build and maintain sales and marketing channel partnerships with major franchise networks and large brokerage companies 
these strategic relationships enable us to tap into their influence  credibility  and existing sales and marketing infrastructure to cost effectively acquire high value customers 
we substantially enhanced our offerings in early with integration of a third party transaction processing system and the addition of licensed marketing design center software 
this created the first such integrated solution for real estate  according to steve murray  editor of real trends  a leading source of analysis and information on the residential brokerage industry 
the initial version of this significantly enhanced platform was configured to the requirements of keller williams with whom we signed a five year technology agreement announced in january this agreement provides for minimum payments from keller williams totaling approximately million through the initial five year term  beginning in april and paid on a quarterly basis 
under the agreement  market leader made its technology available to every keller williams agent and brokerage starting in the second quarter of  and the majority of them have now activated this base level product 
we now expect that strong sales of premium upgrades into the keller williams installed base combined with the contractual revenues will exceed million in we continued the success of our major franchise sales channel as demonstrated by the announcement of our selection on march  by century real estate llc to provide our comprehensive solution to their franchise organization in the us this agreement provides for minimum payments from century totaling 
table of contents million over an initial term of two years from the date of product launch  which is expected to occur in the second half of we also expect to generate additional revenue from premium upgrades as well as other technology and marketing services that will be made available to the century agents and brokerage offices in the us we continued to enhance our software platform in the third quarter of as we launched market insider  a valuable tool for real estate professionals to engage buyers and sellers with customized  up to date reports of home sales  trends  demographics  and side by side statistics on the areas served 
we further extended both our future technology advantage as well as our market reach with the august  acquisition of sharperagent  llc sharperagent for million in cash plus assumed liabilities 
sharperagent is a leading provider of online and print marketing suites that has relationships with leading brokerage companies and more than  real estate agent users across north america 
we plan to integrate sharperagent s marketing campaign  design  and print capabilities into our software platform and expect to offer this to all of our customers in as a result  we terminated our licensing agreement with the third party marketing design center software in december  and incurred a million contract termination fee on september   we acquired the assets of realestate 
com for million in cash 
the acquired assets included the realestate 
com website  trademarks and domain names  including realestate 
com  software related to consumer web services  information  as well as contracts and content necessary to operate the realestate 
com website 
we judged this to be a low risk acquisition  based on our projected ability to utilize the leads generated on realestate 
com sites to reduce our advertising costs  and to thereby drive a payback on our investment in three years or less 
based upon strong early response to the company s initial realestate 
com offering  we now expect it to emerge as a powerful engine of growth as early as the second half of this year 
the value that real estate professionals associate with realestate 
com creates a way for market leader to capture part of the industry s marketing services spend that is migrating away from print  as well as marketing services spend that is moving online to national online portals 
we acquired  through incremental investment late in the third quarter of  a controlling interest in activerain corporation activerain  and we subsequently increased that to ownership in the fourth quarter of activerain is a provider of professional networking  referral  recruitment  content syndication and online marketing tools packaged as software as a service offerings 
activerain serves a growing community of over  professionals in real estate and related businesses 
our affiliation with activerain provides access to a sizable and rapidly growing professional community that often has interest in products like those we offer 
in the first quarter of  we acquired kwkly  llc kwkly  a mobile software as a service lead generation service 
the kwkly service provides home buyers with real time access to property information on their web enabled phones  while at the same time connecting real estate professional customers of kwkly with those home buyers 
our acquisition of kwkly expands the offerings that we can make available through our business and marketing platform for real estate professionals  and we expect to leverage this product more broadly into our customer base

advertising costs decreased in reflecting operational improvements in lead generation costs 
in addition  we have shifted our revenue mix to now include revenue streams that do not have associated advertising costs

the termination was effective december  as a result  we were released from future minimum contractual liabilities totaling million  as well as any and all future revenue sharing payments related to the revenue generated from the premium saas solutions being provided to keller williams professionals 
we will pay early termination fees totaling million 
concurrently  both parties entered into a transitional services agreement for the period january  through june  for which we will pay  interest income and expense  net interest income decreased in when compared to due to decreased rates of return on investments as well as lower balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
income taxes the majority of our deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to reverse over the next five years  except for prior years net operating losses and the deferred tax liability related to goodwill deductions on the goodwill acquired in we believe that based on the decline in the national real estate market and our continued operating losses  it is more likely than not that we will be unable to generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets 
accordingly  a full valuation allowance has been recorded against our deferred tax assets

our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million at december  as compared to million at december  we follow an investment strategy that prioritizes the preservation and security and liquidity of our funds  which has resulted in significantly lower rates of return 
as of december   we have invested in cash equivalents consisting of money market funds that hold u

treasury securities with short term weighted average duration 
short term investments are comprised of us treasury bills and notes and fdic insured certificates of deposit with terms of one year or less 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements as we expect to significantly reduce our use of cash in operations in our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our revenue trend  the level of our marketing and sales activities  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts  and the timing of introductions of new services and enhancements to existing services

the remaining activity was consistent with the same period in purchase and retirement of common stock in october  our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program to purchase and retire up to million shares of our common stock 
we did not make any purchases pursuant to the share repurchase program during at december    shares remain available for purchase under the share repurchase program 
during  an aggregate of  shares of our common stock were tendered at amounts between and per share  in satisfaction of employees income taxes upon the vesting of restricted stock 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the following discussion highlights the policies and estimates we feel are critical 
business combinations  intangible assets  and goodwill valuation when acquired 
we account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting  which requires that we record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair values on the 
table of contents date of acquisition  as well as the valuation of any contingent consideration 
significant judgment is used to estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired  including estimating future cash flows from the acquired business  determining appropriate discount rates  asset lives and other assumptions 
ongoing reporting and impairment testing 
our intangible assets  other than goodwill  and other long lived assets are amortized or depreciated over their estimated useful lives and are tested for recoverability annually or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
our annual testing date is october the assessment of impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill requires significant judgment to determine the asset groups and number of reporting units  to estimate future undiscounted cash flows  to use appropriate market value factors  to estimate the related asset lives and other assumptions as noted below 
changes in these estimates and assumptions can materially affect the fair value determination and potential goodwill impairment 
results of impairment tests 
based on our continued operating losses  we evaluated our long lived assets for impairment during and and determined that our long lived assets were not impaired 
in addition  we evaluated our goodwill for impairment in and consistent with the outcome of our long lived asset assessment  we determined our goodwill was not impaired 
our impairment analysis for goodwill was dependent on many variables 
we determined the fair value of our net assets based on a combination of market and income approaches 
key assumptions used in the market approaches included  the appropriate stock price to determine market value  use of control premium and determination of the appropriate control premium  and determination of an appropriate set of comparable companies 
key assumptions in the income approach were based on a discounted cash flow model  which included significant assumptions about our future revenues  expenses  target profitability rates  and determination of an appropriate discount rate 
our impairment analyses for our long lived assets other than goodwill included a number of key variables  including estimated future cash flows 
we determined the fair value of our long lived assets based on several key assumptions  including the determination that we have a single asset grouping  references to quoted market prices for similar assets  as well as assumptions about our future revenues  expenses  and target profitability rates 
as of december   we have million in goodwill and approximately million of long lived assets 
while we continue to depreciate the long lived assets  at the same time  we continue to capitalize costs related to internally generated software and may acquire other capital assets 
factors that may require future assessments of impairment of our goodwill and long lived assets include  among others  deterioration of our estimate of future cash flows  stock price  lower customer revenues and lower retention rates than projected 
accounting for income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for operating loss carryforwards in our existing business and related to acquisitions 
we must make significant assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine the provision for income taxes and the related current and deferred tax assets and liabilities  as well as the valuation allowance to be recorded against deferred tax assets 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates must take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of future tax audits 
changes in the amount of our operating losses  changes in the tax laws or our interpretation of the tax laws and the resolution of future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes and the amount of valuation allowances required in our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents at december   we have gross deferred tax assets of million  before reduction for our valuation allowance 
we considered all available evidence to determine whether a valuation allowance was required for those assets  including the following factors estimates regarding the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences  taxable income in prior carryback years as permitted under tax law  and historical taxable income normalized for non recurring items  expected future taxable income  and the impact of tax planning strategies 
a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
based on our current projections of future operating losses  we continue to believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets and continue to maintain a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax assets at december  we account for uncertainty in income taxes using a more likely than not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken 
tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of the tax benefits  determined on a cumulative probability basis  which is more likely than not to be realized upon effective settlement 
our accounting policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as tax expense 
stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation related to option grants using the fair value based method 
we use the black scholes pricing model which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including estimating the stock option expected life and stock price volatility 
changes in any of these assumptions could materially impact the estimated fair value of options granted 
the following table illustrates the effect of changing these significant variables on the estimated fair value of our options 
the following examples are hypothetical but representative of our option grants and their related fair values at december  in each analysis  the remaining variables are held constant 
this illustration is not intended to provide a range of exposure or expected deviation 
effect of a change in our stock price volatility estimate current volatility estimate stock option volatility estimated fair value effect of a year change in expected life of our stock options year current expected life estimate year estimated option life years years years estimated fair value recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other 
this standard amends the current two step goodwill impairment test required under the existing accounting guidance 
this amendment allows entities the option to first assess certain qualitative factors to ascertain whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount to determine if the two step impairment test is necessary 
if an entity concludes that certain events or circumstances prove that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its 
table of contents carrying amount then an entity is required to proceed to step one of the two step goodwill impairment test 
this standard is effective during interim and annual periods beginning after december  the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements
