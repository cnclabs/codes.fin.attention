item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our accompanying consolidated audited financial statements and related notes  as well as the risk factors and other information contained in this annual report 
the discussion is based upon  among other things  our consolidated audited financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to  among other things  make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosures of contingent liabilities at the financial statement dates and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we review our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
our estimates are based on our historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results are likely to differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions  but we do not believe such differences will materially affect our financial position or results of operations  although they could 
our critical accounting policies  the policies we believe are most important to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  are outlined below in critical accounting policies 
all references to results of operations in this discussion are references to results of continuing operations  unless otherwise noted 
overview and recent developments we are a provider of wireless handsets which may be referred to herein as phones  cell phones  feature phones and smartphones and accessories to carriers  distributors and oems in latin america  asia pacific  europe and africa 
we design  develop  source and sell our proprietary line of products under the verykool brand and on a private label basis to certain customers collectively referred to as verykool products 
verykool products include entry level  mid tier and high end products 
we first introduced the verykool brand in  and have been working to gain brand identity and grow sales 
we are now in the midst of a transformation of our company as we move from our former existence as a distributor of phones designed  developed and manufactured by others  to our new business model of designing  manufacturing  sourcing and selling our own verykool products 
we believe that we crossed the inflection point during the year ended december  as the majority of our sales were comprised of verykool products 
over the past five years  the majority of our business was derived from distribution of wireless handsets supplied by major manufacturers  primarily samsung and primarily in argentina 
revenue reached its peak in when we recorded million of net sales 
in  of our net sales of million were derived from distribution sales of samsung products to carriers in argentina 
in late  however  a stiff import tariff on certain electronic devices  including wireless handsets  was enacted in argentina 
the tariff had a significant 
table of contents negative impact on our sales beginning in the first quarter of  and ultimately resulted in a decrease of of our sales volume in compared to then  in february  argentina enacted a further import regulation effective march  which signaled the closing stage of our distribution business  and resulted in a decrease in our net sales from to our distribution agreement with samsung was scheduled to expire december  but was extended until march  to accommodate the orderly conclusion of this business 
going forward  we expect our business to be centered on our verykool product line 
our goal is to replace the lost gross profit from distribution revenues with higher margin verykool sales through expansion of our product portfolio and entry into new geographic markets in asia pacific  europe  africa and latin america 
prior to we sourced all our verykool phones from independent design houses and original design manufacturers in china 
in late  with a desire to improve our time to market  better protect our technology and know how and improve our cost structure  we began to search for an experienced management team to serve as the core for an in house design team based in beijing 
in april we recruited a team of very experienced management and technical personnel who now serve as both our design house for all our markets and as the base for marketing and selling our products in asia pacific 
this team currently consists of employees  primarily engineers  located in beijing 
the quarter ended june  was the first full quarter of operation of our china subsidiary 
its expenses are classified as r d expenses on our statement of operations  together with any nre non recurring engineering expenses paid to other design houses 
we shipped our first product designed by our china team to a customer in china in october and shipped other new models to customers during although we expect to continue to use outside design houses to augment the efforts of our china development team  we hope that internally designed products will comprise the majority of our sales by the end of all of our manufacturing continues to be done by contract manufacturers in china 
areas of management focus and performance indicators we focus on the needs of our customers  developing and sourcing new and innovative products  fostering close relationships with manufacturers  and expanding our business in our current markets and entering into new geographic markets  all while maintaining close attention to operational efficiencies and costs 
we are particularly focused on increasing sales volumes of higher margin proprietary products in a cost effective manner to enable us to return to profitability  as well as monitoring and managing levels of accounts receivable and inventory to minimize risk 
performance indicators that are important for the monitoring and management of our business include top line sales growth  cost of sales and gross margin percentage  operating expenses in absolute dollars and as a percent of revenues and operating and net income loss 
we rely upon our in house software management system to exercise real time control over many elements of our business including customer relationship management  purchasing  inventory management and control  sales order control and pricing management 
management and employees spend a significant amount of time traveling to latin america  asia pacific  europe and africa with the purpose of spending time with our key customers  suppliers  our beijing design team and other contractors and employees 
we believe that these relationships are vital to our success and we will continue to dedicate a significant amount of time to this area 
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those policies that  in management s view  are most important in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
the notes to our consolidated financial statements also include disclosure of significant accounting policies 
the methods  estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the condition and results that we report in our financial statements 
these critical accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates and assumptions regarding matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies and estimates and assumptions that require the most significant judgment are discussed further below 

table of contents revenue recognition and allowance for returns revenues for wireless handset and accessory sales are recognized when i shipment of the products to customers has occurred and title has passed  ii when collection of the outstanding receivables is probable and iii the final price of the products is determined  which occurs at the time of shipment 
sales are recorded net of discounts  rebates  cooperative marketing arrangements  returns and allowances 
on select sales  we may agree to cooperative arrangements wherein we agree to fund future marketing programs related to the products purchased by the customer 
such arrangements are usually agreed to in advance 
the amount of the co op allowance is recorded as a reduction of the sale and added to accrued expenses as a current liability 
subsequent expenditures made pursuant to the arrangements reduce this liability 
to the extent we incur costs in excess of the established cooperative fund  we recognize the amount as a selling or marketing expense 
as part of the sales process  we may perform certain value added services such as programming  software loading and quality assurance testing 
these value added services are considered an ancillary component of the sales process and amounts attributable to these processes are included in the unit cost to the customer 
furthermore  these value added services are related to services prior to the shipment of the products  and no value added services are provided after delivery of the products 
we recognize as a reserve against the related receivables estimates for product returns based on historical experience and other judgmental factors  evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis and adjust our estimates each period based on actual product return activity 
we recognize freight costs billed to our customers in sales and actual freight costs incurred as a component of cost of sales 
allowance for doubtful accounts we provide for the possible inability to collect accounts receivable by recording an allowance for doubtful accounts 
we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable on an ongoing basis 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  we record a specific allowance against amounts due in order to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected  after consideration for accounts receivable insurance coverage we may have 
for all other customers  we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  the current business environment and our historical experience 
inventory reserves we regularly monitor inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess  slow moving and obsolete inventories based primarily on historical usage rates and our estimated forecast of product demand and expected pricing 
we attempt to tightly control our inventory levels and in the recent past have moved more to a build to order model 
however  because we need to place non cancelable orders with our contract manufacturers with a lead time of to days  and because we may not have a confirmed customer purchase order in hand as quickly as we would like to  we sometimes take inventory risk 
as our products get closer to end of life status  we are more strict about our build to order policy in order to limit our inventory exposure on older product 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development operating income loss from continuing operations other income expense interest income expense  net other income expense  net income loss from continuing operations before income taxes benefit provision for income taxes income loss from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax net loss we do not believe that inflation had a significant impact on our results of operations for the periods reported in our consolidated audited financial statements 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  net sales for the year ended december   our net sales of million decreased by million  or  compared to net sales of million in the significant decline was primarily the continued effect of a stiff import tariff on certain electronic devices  including wireless handsets  that was enacted in argentina in november and an additional import regulation which became effective in march these protective import actions began to negatively affect our sales beginning in the first quarter of  accelerated through and continued through the end of in  our samsung distribution sales declined by million  or  to million from million in partially offsetting this decline was an increase in sales of our branded verykool products of million  or  to million from million in going forward  we expect our business to be centered on our verykool product line

sales of our verykool branded products typically result in higher gross margins than our distribution sales 
in  distribution sales comprised of total revenues  with only represented by branded sales 
in  distribution sales fell to of total revenues  with coming from branded sales 
operating expenses and operating loss from continuing operations for the year ended december   operating expenses of million decreased by million  or  from million in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses declined by million  but this reduction was partially offset by an increase in r d spending of million related to our new development team in beijing that was established in april to focus on our verykool products 
the majority of the sg a decrease was related to reduction of expenses that were variable with sales volume  which decreased in compared to although we made reductions in other expenses as well  such reductions were not proportionate to the decline in sales 
we significantly reduced marketing and legal expenses in compared to and reduced occupancy expenses through the closure of our miami distribution center in march as a percentage of net sales  total operating expenses increased to in compared to in  primarily due to the reasons outlined above 
for the year ended december   we sustained an operating loss from continuing operations of million compared to an operating loss of million for the year ended december  the reduction in the operating loss in was achieved despite a reduction in net sales 
we generated slightly less gross profit  more than doubled our gross profit margin percentage and reduced operating expenses 
interest expense and other income during the year ended december   we had no bank borrowings and consequently no interest expense 
interest expense in of  related to borrowings under our bank revolving line of credit in the first half of the year 
the line of credit was terminated on september  in we had  of interest income on a tax refund and  of other income consisting primarily of gain on sale of fixed assets

income loss from discontinued operations during the second quarter of  we assessed opportunities in the united states and mexico and decided to implement actions necessary to close sales operations in both of those countries  which we substantially completed in the second half of  although we generated  in income from discontinued operations during from the salvage sale of remaining inventories 
the discontinuation was completed in without any further income or loss 
net loss because the results of discontinued operations in both and were minimal  our net losses in both years were substantially equivalent to the losses from continuing operations for the respective years 

table of contents year ended december  compared with year ended december  net sales for the year ended december   our net sales of million decreased by million  or  compared to net sales of million in the significant decline was primarily the effect of a stiff import tariff on certain electronic devices  including wireless handsets  that was enacted in argentina in november the tariff began to affect our sales beginning in the first quarter of and had a negative impact throughout the year 
in  our samsung distribution sales in argentina declined by million to million from million in distribution sales in the remainder of latin america during fell by an additional million  as samsung began to shift its business to other locally based distributors or distributed directly 
offsetting these declines was an increase in sales of our branded verykool products of million  which represented a increase in sales of those products over in february  argentina enacted a further import regulation effective march  which essentially resulted in the conclusion of our distribution business 
going forward  we expect our business to be centered on our verykool product line 
our goal is to replace the lost gross profit from distribution revenues with higher margin verykool sales through expansion of our product portfolio and entry into new geographic markets in asia pacific and latin america

sales of our verykool branded products typically result in higher gross margins than our distribution sales 
however  verykool margins were reduced in by approximately  charged to cost of sales for reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventories 
operating expenses and operating income loss from continuing operations for the year ended december   operating expenses of million decreased by million  or  from million in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses declined by million  but this reduction was partially offset by an increase in r d spending of million related to our new development team in beijing that was established in april to focus on our verykool products 
the majority of the sg a decrease was related to reduction of expenses that were variable with sales  which decreased in compared to although we made reductions in other expenses as well  such reductions were not proportionate to the decline in revenue 
in response to the declining sales  we made reductions in headcount  but we were only able to reduce wages and benefits by approximately in compared to the prior year 
in addition  we curtailed marketing spending  but had commitments that could not be terminated  thus marketing expenses declined by in compared to as a percentage of net sales  total operating expenses increased to in compared to in 
table of contents for the year ended december   we sustained an operating loss from continuing operations of million  compared to operating income of million for the year ended december  the loss was the result of the significant decrease in sales and gross profit  which was only partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses 
interest expense and other income during the year ended december   borrowing under our bank revolving line of credit was greatly reduced compared to  and we had no borrowings after june  the line of credit was terminated on september  as a consequence  interest expense in amounted to  compared to  in income loss from continuing operations for the year ended december   we sustained a loss from continuing operations of million compared to income of  in the loss from continuing operations  which benefited from a tax refund of  from the carry back of net operating losses in and to prior years  was primarily due to the significant decrease in sales and gross profit during the year as discussed above

financial condition  liquidity and capital resources historically  we have used cash from our sale of products  lines of credit bank and vendor and the sale of securities and exercise of stock options from time to time to provide the capital needed to support our business 
in late we added a new foreign exchange fx hedging facility with our bank as a tool to hedge our exposure to changes in certain foreign currency exchange rates 
the primary drivers affecting our cash and liquidity are net income losses and working capital requirements 
capital equipment is not significant in our business  and at december  we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures 
our largest working capital requirement is for accounts receivable  and  to a lesser extent  inventory  as we strive to minimize our inventory levels 
we typically bill customers on an open account basis subject to our standard credit quality and payment terms ranging between net and net days 
if our net revenue increases  it is likely that our accounts receivable balance will also increase 
our accounts receivable could further increase if customers delay their payments or if we grant them extended payment terms 
as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  million of restricted cash and million of working capital compared to million of cash and cash equivalents and million of working capital as of december  as of december  and  we had no bank debt 
as of december   cash and cash equivalents consisted of cash on hand and in bank accounts 

table of contents operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  amounted to million compared to million of cash provided by operations for the year ended december  although the net loss of million in was smaller than the million loss in  the contraction in our business was much greater in compared to and the reduction in receivables in was the largest factor in the cash generated that year 
in  we generated million of positive cash flow from a reduction in net working capital 
this consisted primarily of a million reduction in trade accounts receivable  reflecting the drop in annual revenue for the year  and million from a reduction in other receivables 
days sales outstanding in receivables at december  was days  which was a significant improvement over days at december  partially offsetting the reduction in receivables was an increase in inventories and prepaids of million and a net reduction in payables and accruals of million 
in  we generated million of positive cash flow from a reduction in net working capital 
this consisted primarily of a million reduction in trade accounts receivable  reflecting a drop in annual sales for the year 
days sales outstanding in receivables at december  was days  which reflected a significant portion of fourth quarter shipments made in the last month of the quarter  as well as several customers that made payments shortly after year end 
an additional million was generated from a reduction of inventories  offset by a combined reduction in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million and 
million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cash used in both years included investment in tooling and molds for our proprietary verykool products  and also included the purchase of computers and office equipment for our newly established design center in beijing 
in  we also invested million in a restricted cash account to secure our obligations under a new fx hedging facility with our bank 
financing activities there were no financing activities in the year ended december  net cash used in financing activities in the year ended december  of million represented the complete retirement of outstanding balances under our revolving credit facility 
in the year ended december   net cash of million was provided by financing activities 
this consisted of million of funding from our credit facility  partially offset by the purchase of company stock in the open market at a cost of 
million 
we previously had a revolving credit facility with a bank pursuant to which we could borrow up to million based on a borrowing base of our accounts receivable and inventories 
the credit facility was secured by all our assets 
on july   although we had no outstanding borrowings at the time and were in compliance with all of our covenants under the credit facility  we received a notice from the lender of its election to terminate the credit facility on september   the end of the day notice period 
it is our belief that the principal reasons for the lender s actions were the decreased utilization of the facility by us  the high level of capital reserves required by the lender to support the facility and our lack of profitability 
based on our current outlook for our business  we believe that our current cash resources and working capital are sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future 
however  our cash and working capital needs could change significantly if our business continues to grow rapidly 
the lack of a line of credit could inhibit our growth 
for this reason  we continue evaluating potential lines of credit 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements 

table of contents contractual obligations we lease corporate and administrative office facilities and equipment under non cancelable operating leases 
rent expense under these leases was approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
at december   we had no amounts outstanding related to any debt obligations 
the following is a schedule of aggregate future minimum rental payments required by the above leases in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk for us refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and various foreign currencies 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
this forward looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures 
interest rates at december   we had no outstanding interest bearing debt and no rate sensitive investments 
foreign exchange and other risks at december  and  foreign currency cash accounts in mexican pesos amounted to  and  respectively 
also at december   accounts receivable denominated in mexican pesos amounted to  prior to december  all of our sales transactions were denominated in us dollars 
beginning in december  we began to price sales in foreign currencies only to certain customers in mexico 
product costs  and the majority of our operating expenses are also denominated in us dollars  but payroll and other costs of our beijing development team are denominated in chinese yuan renminbi 
foreign currency risks are associated with our cash  receivables  payroll and payables denominated in foreign currencies 
fluctuations in exchange rates will result in foreign exchange gains and losses on these foreign currency assets and liabilities  which are included in other income expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
at december  we had a single foreign currency forward contract in the amount of  as a result of our international sales  our future operating results could be adversely affected by a variety of factors  including changes in specific countries political  economic or regulatory conditions and trade protection measures  particularly china 
our market risk management includes an accounts receivable insurance policy for our foreign sales  as well as any domestic sales 
however  there can be no assurance that our insurance policy will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates  political  economic or regulatory conditions on its results of operations and financial position 
we do not believe that foreign currency fluctuations had a material impact on our financial results during  or
