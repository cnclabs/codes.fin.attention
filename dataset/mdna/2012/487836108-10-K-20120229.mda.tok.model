our consolidated net sales were up on an as reported basis and up on an internal basis behind favorable pricing mix  approximately flat volume  and strong results from innovations across most markets 
innovations and solid execution contributed to share gains in our core cereal business as well as several other key categories 
additionally  the increased investment in our supply chain that began in and continued through is building a stronger foundation for future growth 
pricing was taken selectively throughout to offset the higher input costs we have experienced on many products across our categories around the world 
internal net sales for us morning foods kashi increased as a result of favorable pricing mix and approximately flat volume 
this business has two product groups cereal and snacks 
cereal s internal net sales increased by resulting from strong innovation launches and reduced reliance on promotional spending 
dollar sales from our innovation in equaled the dollar sales from innovation introduced by all our competitors combined 
snacks toaster pastries  kashi branded cereal bars  crackers  cookies  stretch island fruit snacks  and health and wellness internal net sales increased by as a result of double digit growth in health and wellness and continued share gains in our pop tarts business 
internal net sales in us snacks increased by as a result of favorable pricing mix and approximately flat volume 
this business consists of cookies  crackers  cereal bars  and fruit flavored snacks 
the sales growth was the result of strong crackers consumption behind the launch of special k cracker chips and cheez it innovation which contributed to a solid improvement in our cracker category share 
sales also improved in wholesome snacks as a result of innovations in our special k and fiberplus cereal bars business 
cookies low single digit sales growth was favorably impacted by the launch of the keebler master brand initiative in the second quarter which aligned pricing  packaging and scale across the keebler brand 
internal net sales in us specialty increased by as a result of favorable pricing mix and approximately flat volume 
sales growth was due to frozen food innovation launches and cereal bar distribution gains 
internal net sales in north america other us frozen and canada increased by due to mid single digit volume growth and favorable pricing mix 
sales growth was the result of our us frozen business posting double digit growth for the year while gaining share as a result of increased brand building support behind innovation activity 
our international segments internal net sales were up compared to the prior year as a result of favorable pricing mix  partially offset by a decline in volume 
europe s internal net sales declined for the year driven by a decline in volume  partially offset by favorable pricing mix 
the operating environment in europe continued to be difficult as a result of economic conditions and competitive activity 
sales growth in russia was solid  as we continue to transition from a non branded to a branded product mix 
latin america s internal net sales growth was due to a slight increase in volume and double digit increase in pricing mix 
latin america experienced growth in both cereal and snacks behind a mid double digit increase in brand building investment to support innovations 
internal net sales in asia pacific grew as a result of favorable pricing mix and approximately flat volume 
asia pacific s growth was driven by strong performance across most of asia  as well as south africa 
consolidated operating profit declined by on an as reported basis and was down on an internal basis  when excluding the impact of foreign currency translation 
operating profit for the year was negatively impacted by our supply chain investments  commodity inflation  and the reinstatement of our incentive compensation program as a result of our strong pay for performance orientation 
internal operating profit in us morning foods kashi increased by  us snacks declined by  us specialty declined by  north america other grew by  europe declined by  latin america increased by and asia pacific increased by

our consolidated net sales were down on both a reported and internal basis  behind a reduction in volume that was partially offset by favorable pricing mix 
there were three major issues that affected our results 
first  our categories respond to innovation and brand building 
we did not have sufficient cereal innovations in rather  we focused on renovating our existing cereal products 
we invested in renovation to improve the nutritional profile of our products 
secondly  we experienced supply chain disruptions in our waffle business and had a second quarter recall of select packages of breakfast cereals in our us business 
as a result  we increased investment in our supply chain to mitigate potential risks 
next  we experienced weakness in our core cereal businesses due to the competitive environment which drove price deflation into the cereal category 
in late we announced price increases driven by higher input costs on many products across our categories around the world 
internal net sales for us morning foods kashi declined as a result of a decline in volume and unfavorable pricing mix 
cereal s internal net sales declined by 
our consumption was negatively impacted by the cereal recall that occurred in the second quarter of the brands involved in the recall were the cornerstone of our back to school promotions in the third quarter 
promotional pricing drove deflation into the category  but did not drive higher category volumes as would be expected 
the us cereal category responds well to innovation 
while there were lower levels of innovation across the category in  our innovations performed well 
we were also impacted by less support from non measured channels 
trade inventory levels at the end of were higher than normal 
as a result  our sales were negatively impacted as retailers sold through their inventory  reducing their purchases from us 
snacks internal net sales increased by primarily driven by pop tarts 
us snack s internal net sales declined slightly as a result of a decline in volume  partially offset by favorable pricing mix 
the slight decline was driven by weak performance in cookies and  to a lesser extent  crackers 
we were able to maintain our cracker category share in measured channels despite increased competitive promotional activity 
consumption in the cookie category was down for the year 
our cookie performance was also impacted by the loss of shelf space in non measured channels  which we were able to regain during the fourth quarter of this decline was partially offset by strong wholesome snack sales including our bar innovations such as fiberplus and special k fruit crisps 
internal net sales in north america other decreased by as a result of a decline in volume  partially offset by favorable pricing mix 
our sales were negatively impacted during the year due to the waffle supply disruption that began late in during  we returned to full capacity and introduced new innovations 
while the business rebounded slower than expected during as it took longer to re supply and reset retailer shelves  we reinstated brand building and the business responded positively 
our veggie business performed well  particularly morningstar farms burgers and entrees 
our international segments internal net sales were flat compared to the prior year as a result of a improvement in pricing mix which was offset by reduction in volume 
europe s internal net sales declined for the year which was primarily the result of volume decline 
the cereal category as measured by consumption declined in our core european countries such as the uk additionally  we saw price deflation in many food categories across europe  especially in the uk weakness in the russia snack business due to transition from a non branded business to a branded business drove lower volumes and contributed to europe s lower top line results 
latin america s internal net sales growth was resulting from favorable pricing mix  partially offset by volume decline 
the growth in cereal masked the decline in snacks 
our decline in snacks was largely driven by venezuela where we import some products from mexico 
the imports were impacted by exchange rate controls and it was no longer cost efficient to import goods 
internal net sales in asia pacific grew as a result of a increase in volume  partially offset by unfavorable pricing mix 
asia pacific s growth was driven by strong performance across most of asia  as well as south africa 
this was muted by a decline in australia where the cereal category faced price deflation 
consolidated operating profit declined by on an as reported basis and was flat on an internal basis  when excluding the impact of foreign currency translation 
operating profit for the year was negatively impacted by the cereal recall  higher than expected commodity inflation and investments in our supply chain 
operating profit benefited from lower incentive compensation expense 
incentive compensation is based upon the company s actual results compared to our target 
given results were lower than our targets  which were set at the beginning of  incentive compensation decreased significantly compared to the prior year 
despite s operating performance  we recognized the need to invest in advertising 
accordingly  we increased our spending in advertising by  excluding the impact of foreign currency translation 
internal operating profit in us morning foods kashi decreased by  us snacks grew by  us specialty increased  north america other declined by  europe grew by  latin america declined by and asia pacific declined by 
us morning foods kashi s decline was attributable to lower sales in cereal 
competitive activity drove lower cereal sales as did the second quarter cereal recall 
these negative drivers were partially offset by higher sales in snacks primarily due to pop tarts  lower incentive compensation expense and decreased spending on cost reduction initiatives 
us snacks increase was attributable to lower incentive compensation expense 
us specialty increased due to lower incentive compensation costs and the favorable impact of cost reduction initiatives 
europe s operating profit increased due to lower commodity costs and less spending on cost reduction initiatives 
the decline in latin america s operating profit is primarily a result of higher commodity costs 
asia pacific s operating profit was negatively impacted by the impairment charges related to our business in china 
refer to note within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
corporate benefited from lower incentive compensation expense 
margin performance margin performance was as follows change vs 
prior year pts 
gross margin a sga b operating margin a gross profit as a percentage of net sales 
gross profit is equal to net sales less cost of goods sold 
b selling  general  and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales 
as illustrated in the preceding table  our consolidated gross margin declined by basis points in due to the expanded investments in our supply chain  and increased cost pressures for fuel  energy  and commodities  which were partially offset by savings from cost reduction initiatives 
our selling  general and administrative sga expense as a percentage of net sales decreased by basis points primarily due to a reduction in brand building investment as a percent of net sales and decreased costs related to cost reduction initiatives  partially offset by increased incentive compensation expense 
our consolidated gross margin declined by basis points in due to the cereal recall  increased cost pressures for fuel  energy  commodities and employee benefits and supply chain investments  which were more than offset by savings from cost reduction initiatives and lower up front costs recorded in cost of sales cogs 
our sga expense as a percentage of net sales decreased by basis points primarily due to a reduction in incentive compensation expense and lower costs for cost reduction initiatives  which more than offset increased advertising investment and an impairment of goodwill 
foreign currency translation the reporting currency for our financial statements is the us dollar 
certain of our assets  liabilities  expenses and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily in the euro  british pound  mexican peso  australian dollar and canadian dollar 
to prepare our consolidated financial statements  we must translate those assets  liabilities  expenses and revenues into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates 
as a result  increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar against these other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements  even if their value has not changed in their original currency 
this could have significant impact on our results if such increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar is substantial 
volatility in the foreign exchange markets has limited our ability to forecast future us dollar reported earnings 
as such  we are measuring diluted earnings per share growth and providing guidance on future earnings on a currency neutral basis  assuming earnings are translated at the prior year s exchange rates 
this non gaap financial measure is being used to focus management and investors on local currency business results  thereby providing visibility to the underlying trends of the company 
management believes that excluding the impact of foreign currency from eps provides a useful measurement of comparability given the volatility in foreign exchange markets 
below is a reconciliation of reported eps to currency neutral eps for the fiscal years  and consolidated results diluted net earnings per share eps translational impact a currency neutral eps currency neutral eps growth b a translation impact is the difference between reported eps and the translation of current year net profits at prior year exchange rates  adjusted for gains losses on translational hedges  if applicable 
b calculated as a percentage of growth from the prior year s reported eps 
interest expense annual interest expense for the to periods has trended downward 
the decline in was due primarily to charges of approximately million in for early redemption of long term debt and lower interest rates on our long term debt 
interest income recorded in other income expense  net was in millions   income taxes our reported effective tax rates for  and were  and respectively 
the impact of discrete adjustments and the cost of remitted and unremitted foreign earnings reduced our effective income tax rate by percentage points for for and the impact was a reduction of and percentage points  respectively 
refer to note within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact the expected effective income tax rate as it is dependent upon us dollar earnings of foreign subsidiaries doing business in various countries with differing statutory tax rates 
additionally  the rate could be impacted if pending uncertain tax matters  including tax positions that could be affected by planning initiatives  are resolved more or less favorably than we currently expect 
product withdrawal refer to note within notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows supplemented by borrowings for major acquisitions and other significant transactions 
our cash generating capability is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting operating and investing needs 
we believe that our operating cash flows  together with our credit facilities and other available debt financing  will be adequate to meet our operating  investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future 
however  there can be no assurance that volatility and or disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
on february  we announced that we entered into an agreement to acquire procter gamble s pringles business for billion which is expected to be funded by international cash and the issuance of approximately billion of short and long term debt 
the transaction is expected to close in the summer of  as such  we expect to have the pringles business included in our results for approximately six months 
we plan to decrease our share repurchase program while we pay down debt  but we are likely to repurchase shares to the extent of stock option exercise to offset the dilution effect 
we also expect to maintain a strong investment grade rating and are committed to reducing debt levels to rebuild our financial flexibility 
the following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows dollars in millions net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents net increase in cash and cash equivalents operating activities the principal source of our operating cash flows is net earnings  meaning cash receipts from the sale of our products  net of costs to manufacture and market our products 
our net cash provided by operating activities for amounted to  million  an increase of million compared with the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to lower pension and postretirement benefit plan contributions and lower payments for incentive compensation partially offset by a marginal increase in core working capital in our net cash provided by operating activities for amounted to  million  a decrease of million compared with  reflecting higher pension and postretirement benefit plan contributions and increased payments for advertising and promotion in our cash conversion cycle defined as days of inventory and trade receivables outstanding less days of trade payables outstanding  based on a trailing month average is relatively short  equating to approximately days for  and days for each of and core working capital in averaged of net sales  compared to in and in during  core working capital was negatively impacted by higher days of inventory and higher days of trade receivables 
higher days of inventory was necessary to support our new product introductions and to maintain appropriate levels of service while investing in our supply chain infrastructure 
higher days of trade receivables resulted from strong sales at year end due to our innovation launches and special k new year s resolution programs 
during  core working capital was negatively impacted by higher days of inventory needed to improve order fill levels  which was compounded by the impact of lower reported sales 
our total pension and postretirement benefit plan funding amounted to million  million and million  in  and  respectively 
during the fourth quarter of  we made incremental contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit plans amounting to million million  net of tax 
the pension protection act ppa  and subsequent regulations  determines defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements in the united states 
we believe that we will not be required to make any contributions under ppa requirements until or beyond 
our projections concerning timing of ppa funding requirements are subject to change primarily based on general market conditions affecting trust asset performance  future discount rates based on average yields of high quality corporate bonds and our decisions regarding certain elective provisions of the ppa 
we currently project that we will make total us and foreign benefit plan contributions in of approximately million 
actual contributions could be different from our current projections  as influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts versus other competing investment priorities  future changes in government requirements  trust asset performance  renewals of union contracts  or higher than expected health care claims cost experience 
we measure cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for property additions 
we use this non gaap financial measure of cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available for debt repayment  dividend distributions  acquisition opportunities  and share repurchases 
our cash flow metric is reconciled to the most comparable gaap measure  as follows dollars in millions net cash provided by operating activities additions to properties cash flow year over year change year over year changes in cash flow as defined were driven by variations in both the amount of contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit plans and core working capital as well as changes in the level of capital expenditures during the three year period 
investing activities our net cash used in investing activities for amounted to million  an increase of million compared with due to a higher level of capital expenditures in capital spending in included investments in our supply chain infrastructure and to support capacity requirements in certain markets 
in addition  we continued the investment in our information technology infrastructure related to the reimplementation and upgrade of our sap platform 
in  we spent capital on our sap platform and invested in our supply chain 
in  we invested in a new facility to manufacture ready to eat cereal in mexico and completed the expansion of our global research center  one of the key incubators of innovation for our business  located in battle creek  michigan 
net cash used in investing activities of million in increased by million compared with  reflecting capital projects for our reimplementation and upgrade of our sap platform and investments in our supply chain 
cash paid for additions to properties as a percentage of net sales has grown to in  from in  and in financing activities our net cash used in financing activities for  and amounted to million  million  and  million  respectively 
total debt was billion at year end and billion at year end in april  we repaid million ten year us dollar notes at maturity with commercial paper 
in may  we issued million of seven year fixed rate us dollar notes  using the proceeds of million for general corporate purposes and repayment of commercial paper 
during  the company entered into interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling million  which effectively converted these notes from a fixed rate to a floating rate obligation through maturity 
the effective interest rate on these notes  reflecting issuance discount and interest rate swaps was in december in november  we issued million of five year fixed rate u 
s 
dollar notes  using the proceeds of million for general corporate purposes and repayment of commercial paper 
the effective interest rate on these notes  reflecting issuance discount and hedge settlement was in december in december  we issued billion of ten year fixed rate us dollar notes  using a portion of the million net proceeds to make incremental pension and postretirement benefit plan contributions 
the proceeds were also used to retire commercial paper 
the effective interest rate on these notes  reflecting issuance discount and hedge settlement was in december in november  we issued million of ten year fixed rate us dollar notes  and used proceeds of million to retire a portion of our us dollar notes due we retired million of the debt  which had an effective interest rate of  through a tender offer 
in connection with the debt retirement  we recognized million of interest expense and an acceleration of million loss on an interest rate swap  which was previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
these charges were included in cash flows from operating activities 
in may  we issued million of seven year fixed rate us dollar notes  and used proceeds of million to pay down commercial paper 
in may  we also entered into interest rate swaps on  million of our debt 
interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling million effectively converted our us dollar notes due from a fixed rate to a floating rate obligation for the remainder of the five year term 
in addition  interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling million effectively converted a portion of our us dollar notes due from a fixed rate to a floating rate obligation for the remaining term 
in april  our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock amounting to billion during through this three year authorization replaced previous share buyback programs which had authorized stock repurchases of up to billion for and million for under these programs  we repurchased approximately million  million and million shares of common stock for million  billion and million during  and  respectively 
we paid quarterly dividends to shareholders totaling per share in  per share in and per share in total cash paid for dividends increased by in and in in march  we entered into an unsecured four year credit agreement to replace our existing unsecured five year credit agreement which would have expired in november the four year credit agreement allows us to borrow  on a revolving credit basis  up to billion 
our long term debt agreements contain customary covenants that limit the company and some of its subsidiaries from incurring certain liens or from entering into certain sale and lease back transactions 
some agreements also contain change in control provisions 
however  they do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses that are dependent on credit ratings 
a change in the company s credit ratings could limit our access to the us short term debt market and or increase the cost of refinancing long term debt in the future 
however  even under these circumstances  we would continue to have access to our four year credit agreement  which expires in march this source of liquidity is unused and available on an unsecured basis  although we do not currently plan to use it 
we plan to use a combination of commercial paper and future issuances of term debt to refinance our million of debt maturing in the fourth quarter of capital and credit markets  including commercial paper markets  continued to experience instability and disruption as the us and global economies underwent a period of extreme uncertainty 
throughout this period of uncertainty  we continued to have access to the us and canadian commercial paper markets 
our commercial paper and term debt credit ratings were not affected by the changes in the credit environment 
we monitor the financial strength of our third party financial institutions  including those that hold our cash and cash equivalents as well as those who serve as counterparties to our credit facilities  our derivative financial instruments  and other arrangements 
we continue to believe that we will be able to meet our interest and principal repayment obligations and maintain our debt covenants for the foreseeable future  while still meeting our operational needs  including the pursuit of selected bolt on acquisitions 
this will be accomplished through our strong cash flow  our short term borrowings  and our maintenance of credit facilities on a global basis 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and january  we did not have any material off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  contractual obligations payments due by period millions total and beyond long term debt principal interest a capital leases b operating leases c purchase obligations d uncertain tax positions e other long term obligations f total a includes interest payments on our long term debt and payments on our interest rate swaps 
interest calculated on our variable rate debt was forecasted using the libor forward rate curve as of december  b the total expected cash payments on our capital leases include interest expense totaling approximately million over the periods presented above 
c operating leases represent the minimum rental commitments under non cancelable operating leases 
d purchase obligations consist primarily of fixed commitments for raw materials to be utilized in the normal course of business and for marketing  advertising and other services 
the amounts presented in the table do not include items already recorded in accounts payable or other current liabilities at year end  nor does the table reflect cash flows we are likely to incur based on our plans  but are not obligated to incur 
therefore  it should be noted that the exclusion of these items from the table could be a limitation in assessing our total future cash flows under contracts 
e as of december   our total liability for uncertain tax positions was million  of which million  is expected to be paid in the next twelve months 
we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to the remaining million 
f other long term obligations are those associated with noncurrent liabilities recorded within the consolidated balance sheet at year end and consist principally of projected commitments under deferred compensation arrangements  multiemployer plans  and supplemental employee retirement benefits 
the table also includes our current estimate of minimum contributions to defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans through as follows  critical accounting estimates promotional expenditures our promotional activities are conducted either through the retail trade or directly with consumers and include activities such as in store displays and events  feature price discounts  consumer coupons  contests and loyalty programs 
the costs of these activities are generally recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded  which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure 
the recognition of these costs therefore requires management judgment regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed by either the retail trade or consumer 
these estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs 
differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are normally insignificant and recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period 
on a full year basis  these subsequent period adjustments generally represent less than of our company s net sales 
however  our company s total promotional expenditures including amounts classified as a revenue reduction represented approximately of net sales  therefore  it is likely that our results would be materially different if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail 
property long lived assets such as property  plant and equipment are tested for impairment when conditions indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
management evaluates several conditions  including  but not limited to  the following a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or an asset group  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used  including an extended period of idleness  and a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
for assets to be held and used  we project the expected future undiscounted cash flows generated by the long lived asset or asset group over the remaining useful life of the primary asset 
if the cash flow analysis yields an amount less than the carrying amount we determine the fair value of the asset or asset group by using comparable market data 
there are inherent uncertainties associated with the judgments and estimates we use in these analyses 
at december   we have property  plant and equipment of billion  net of accumulated depreciation  on our balance sheet 
included in this amount are approximately million of idle assets 
the largest individual idle asset is a facility outside the united states which we tested for impairment on a held and used basis 
the estimated future undiscounted cash flows exceeded the net book value of the facility as of december  management estimates the plant will be deployed within the next several years 
should management s plan for deployment change  this could result in an impairment charge of up to million based on the carrying value as of december  goodwill and other intangible assets we perform an impairment evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at least annually during the fourth quarter of each year in conjunction with our annual budgeting process 
during the fourth quarter of we changed our reporting structure which altered the composition of the reporting units within the us morning foods and kashi operating segment 
the changes resulted in the reassignment of the assets and liabilities to the reporting units impacted 
the goodwill was allocated to the reporting units impacted using the relative fair value approach 
goodwill impairment testing first requires a comparison between the carrying value and fair value of a reporting unit with associated goodwill 
carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit  which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units 
for the goodwill impairment test  the fair value of the reporting units was estimated based on market multiples 
our approach employs market multiples based on earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  earnings for companies comparable to our reporting units and discounted cash flows 
management believes the assumptions used for the impairment test are consistent with those utilized by a market participant performing similar valuations for our reporting units 
similarly  impairment testing of indefinite lived intangible assets requires a comparison of carrying value to fair value of that particular asset 
fair values of non goodwill intangible assets are based primarily on projections of future cash flows to be generated from that asset 
for instance  cash flows related to a particular trademark would be based on a projected royalty stream attributable to branded product sales discounted at rates consistent with rates used by market participants 
these estimates are made using various inputs including historical data  current and anticipated market conditions  management plans  and market comparables 
we also evaluate the useful life over which a non goodwill intangible asset with a finite life is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the cash flows of the company 
reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence  demand  competition  other economic factors such as the stability of the industry  known technological advances  legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment  and expected changes in distribution channels  the level of required maintenance expenditures  and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 
at december   goodwill and other intangible assets amounted to billion  consisting primarily of goodwill and trademarks associated with the acquisition of keebler foods company 
within this total  approximately billion of non goodwill intangible assets were classified as indefinite lived  comprised principally of keebler trademarks 
we currently believe that the fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets exceeds their carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to the cash flows of the company 
at december   the fair value of our us snacks reporting unit exceeded its book value by billion 
however  if we had used materially different assumptions  which we do not believe are reasonably possible  regarding the future performance of our business or a different weighted average cost of capital in the valuation  this could have resulted in significant impairment losses 
additionally  we have million of goodwill related to our acquisition of united bakers in russia 
the percentage of excess fair value over carrying value of the russian reporting unit was approximately in both and if we used modestly different assumptions regarding sales multiples and ebitda in the valuation  this could have resulted in an impairment loss 
for example  if our projection of ebitda margins had been lower by basis points  this change in assumption may have resulted in impairment of some or all of the goodwill in the russian reporting unit 
management will continue to monitor the situation closely 
retirement benefits our company sponsors a number of us and foreign defined benefit employee pension plans and also provides retiree health care and other welfare benefits in the united states and canada 
plan funding strategies are influenced by tax regulations and asset return performance 
a substantial majority of plan assets are invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of debt securities and other investments 
we recognize the cost of benefits provided during retirement over the employees active working life to determine the obligations and expense related to our retiree benefit plans 
inherent in this concept is the requirement to use various actuarial assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date 
major actuarial assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our consolidated benefits expense and accumulated obligation include the long term rates of return on plan assets  the health care cost trend rates  and the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our major plans  which cover employees in the united states  united kingdom and canada 
to conduct our annual review of the long term rate of return on plan assets  we model expected returns over a year investment horizon with respect to the specific investment mix of each of our major plans 
the return assumptions used reflect a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and forward looking views of the financial markets including consideration of current yields on long term bonds  price earnings ratios of the major stock market indices  and long term inflation 
our us plan model  corresponding to approximately of our trust assets globally  currently incorporates a long term inflation assumption of and an active management premium of net of fees validated by historical analysis 
although we review our expected long term rates of return annually  our benefit trust investment performance for one particular year does not  by itself  significantly influence our evaluation 
our expected rates of return are generally not revised  provided these rates continue to fall within a more likely than not corridor of between the th and th percentile of expected long term returns  as determined by our modeling process 
our assumed rate of return for us plans in of equated to approximately the nd percentile expectation of our model 
similar methods are used for various foreign plans with invested assets  reflecting local economic conditions 
foreign trust investments represent approximately of our global benefit plan assets 
based on consolidated benefit plan assets at december   a basis point reduction in the assumed rate of return would increase benefits expense by approximately million 
correspondingly  a basis point shortfall between the assumed and actual rate of return on plan assets for would result in a similar amount of arising experience loss 
any arising asset related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculated value of plan assets over a five year period 
once recognized  experience gains and losses are amortized using a declining balance method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants  which for us plans is presently about years 
under this recognition method  a basis point shortfall in actual versus assumed performance of all of our plan assets in would reduce pre tax earnings by approximately million in  increasing to approximately million in for each of the three fiscal years  our actual return on plan assets exceeded was less than the recognized assumed return by the following amounts in millions   to conduct our annual review of health care cost trend rates  we model our actual claims cost data over a five year historical period  including an analysis of pre versus post age groups and other important demographic components in our covered retiree population 
this data is adjusted to eliminate the impact of plan changes and other factors that would tend to distort the underlying cost inflation trends 
our initial health care cost trend rate is reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with recent historical experience and our expectations regarding short term future trends 
in comparison to our actual five year compound annual claims cost growth rate of approximately  our initial trend rate for of reflects the expected future impact of faster growing claims experience for certain demographic groups within our total employee population 
our initial rate is trended downward by per year  until the ultimate trend rate of is reached 
the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually  as necessary  to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium 
based on consolidated obligations at december   a basis point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates would increase benefits expense by approximately million 
a basis point excess of actual health care claims cost over that calculated from the assumed trend rate would result in an arising experience loss of approximately million 
any arising health care claims cost related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculated amount of claims experience over a four year period 
once recognized  experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight line method over years 
the net experience gain arising from recognition of claims experience and adoption of an employer group waiver plan egwp design for prescription drug costs was approximately million 
to conduct our annual review of discount rates  we selected the discount rate based on a cash flow matching analysis using towers watson s proprietary rate link tool and projections of the future benefit payments constituting the projected benefit obligation for the plans 
rate link establishes the uniform discount rate that produces the same present value of the estimated future benefit payments  as is generated by discounting each year s benefit payments by a spot rate applicable to that year 
the spot rates used in this process are derived from a yield curve created from yields on the th to th percentile of us high quality bonds 
a similar methodology is applied in canada and europe  except the smaller bond markets imply that yields between the th and th percentiles are preferable 
the measurement dates for our defined benefit plans are consistent with our fiscal year end 
accordingly  we select discount rates to measure our benefit obligations that are consistent with market indices during december of each year 
based on consolidated obligations at december   a basis point decline in the weighted average discount rate used for benefit plan measurement purposes would increase benefits expense by approximately million 
all obligation related experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight line method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants 
despite the previously described rigorous policies for selecting major actuarial assumptions  we periodically experience material differences between assumed and actual experience 
as of december   we had consolidated unamortized prior service cost and net experience losses of approximately billion  compared to approximately billion at january  of the total unamortized amounts at december   approximately billion was related to asset losses that occurred during and  offset by billion in asset gains during and  with the remainder largely related to discount rate reductions and health care claims experience 
for  we currently expect total amortization of prior service cost and net experience losses to be approximately million higher than the actual amount of approximately million 
total employee benefit expense for is expected to be higher than due to lower discount rates  phase in of the and investment losses  offset by better than expected and investment performance 
during we made contributions in the amount of million to kellogg s global tax qualified pension programs 
this amount was mostly discretionary 
additionally we contributed million to our retiree medical programs 
assuming actual future experience is consistent with our current assumptions  annual amortization of accumulated prior service cost and net experience losses during each of the next several years would increase versus the amount 
income taxes our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
the calculation of our income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgment 
income taxes are provided on the portion of foreign earnings that is expected to be remitted to and taxable in the united states 
we recognize tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions when  in our judgment  it is more likely than not that the positions will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority 
for tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold  we initially and subsequently measure the tax benefits as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
our liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances  such as the progress of tax audits  new or emerging legislation and tax planning 
the tax position will be derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not of being sustained 
significant adjustments to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits impacting our effective tax rate are separately presented in the rate reconciliation table of note within notes to consolidated financial statements 
accounting standards to be adopted in future periods presentation of comprehensive income in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a new accounting standard requiring most entities to present items of net income and other comprehensive income either in one continuous statement referred to as the statement of comprehensive income or in two separate  but consecutive  statements of net income and other comprehensive income 
the update does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income 
the new standard included a requirement to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component on the face of the financial statements 
in december   the reclassification requirement within the new standard was indefinitely deferred 
the new standard is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  and should be applied retrospectively 
early adoption is permitted 
we will adopt the new standard at the beginning of our fiscal year 
goodwill impairment testing in september  the fasb issued an updated accounting standard allowing entities the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
under the updated standard an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
the updated standard is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
we will adopt the updated standard in connection with our annual goodwill impairment evaluation in the fourth quarter of future outlook on february  we announced that we entered into an agreement to acquire procter gamble s pringles business for million which is expected to be funded by international cash and the issuance of approximately billion of short and long term debt 
the transaction is expected to close in the summer of  as such we expect having pringle s included in our results for approximately six months 
we anticipate in we will continue to set the foundation for future growth as a result of price realization and mix improvement driven by innovation and supported by increased investment in brand building 
earnings per share on a currency neutral basis is expected to grow by to percent  prior to the impact of the pringles acquisition which is expected to be dilutive to earnings per share by to including one time costs and changes to the share repurchase program 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our company is exposed to certain market risks  which exist as a part of our ongoing business operations 
we use derivative financial and commodity instruments  where appropriate  to manage these risks 
as a matter of policy  we do not engage in trading or speculative transactions 
refer to note within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our derivative financial and commodity instruments 
foreign exchange risk our company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related primarily to third party purchases  intercompany transactions  and when applicable  nonfunctional currency denominated third party debt 
our company is also exposed to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments 
additionally  our company is exposed to volatility in the translation of foreign currency denominated earnings to us dollars 
primary exposures include the us dollar versus the euro  british pound  australian dollar  canadian dollar  and mexican peso  and in the case of inter subsidiary transactions  the british pound versus the euro 
we assess foreign currency risk based on transactional cash flows and translational volatility and may enter into forward contracts  options  and currency swaps to reduce fluctuations in long or short currency positions 
forward contracts and options are generally less than months duration 
currency swap agreements may be established in conjunction with the term of underlying debt issuances 
the total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at year end was  million  representing a settlement obligation of million 
the total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at year end was  million  representing a settlement obligation of million 
all of these derivatives were hedges of anticipated transactions  translational exposure  or existing assets or liabilities  and mature within months 
assuming an unfavorable change in year end exchange rates  the settlement obligation would have increased by approximately million at year end and million at year end these unfavorable changes would generally have been offset by favorable changes in the values of the underlying exposures 
venezuela was designated as a highly inflationary economy as of the beginning of our fiscal year 
gains and losses resulting from the translation of the financial statements of subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies are recorded in earnings 
as of the end of our fiscal year  we used the parallel rate to translate our venezuelan subsidiary s financial statements to us dollars 
in may  the venezuelan government effectively eliminated the parallel market 
in june  several large venezuelan commercial banks began operating the transaction system for foreign currency denominated securities sitme 
accordingly  we began using the sitme rate as of january  to translate our venezuelan subsidiary s financial statements to us dollars 
during  we recorded a million foreign exchange gain in other income expense  net  associated with the translation of our subsidiary s financials into us dollars  with no impact during on a consolidated basis  venezuela represents less than of our business  therefore  any ongoing impact is expected to be immaterial 
interest rate risk our company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed rate debt and existing and future issuances of variable rate debt 
primary exposures include movements in us treasury rates  london interbank offered rates libor  and commercial paper rates 
we periodically use interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to reduce interest rate volatility and funding costs associated with certain debt issues  and to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt  based on current and projected market conditions 
during and  we entered into interest rate swaps in connection with certain us dollar notes 
refer to disclosures contained in note within notes to consolidated financial statements 
the total notional amount of interest rate swaps at year end was million  representing a settlement receivable of million 
the total notional amount of interest rate swaps at year end was billion  representing a settlement receivable of million 
assuming average variable rate debt levels during the year  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense by approximately million at year end and million at year end price risk our company is exposed to price fluctuations primarily as a result of anticipated purchases of raw and packaging materials  fuel  and energy 
primary exposures include corn  wheat  soybean oil  sugar  cocoa  cartonboard  natural gas  and diesel fuel 
we have historically used the combination of long term contracts with suppliers  and exchange traded futures and option contracts to reduce price fluctuations in a desired percentage of forecasted raw material purchases over a duration of generally less than months 
during  we entered into two separate year over the counter commodity swap transactions to reduce fluctuations in the price of natural gas used principally in our manufacturing processes 
the notional amount of the swaps totaled million as of december  and equates to approximately of our north america manufacturing needs over the remaining hedge period 
at year end january  the notional amount was million 
the total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at year end  including the north america natural gas swaps  was million  representing a settlement obligation of approximately million 
the total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at year end  including the natural gas swaps  was million  representing a settlement obligation of approximately million 
assuming a decrease in year end commodity prices  the settlement obligation would have increased by approximately million at year end  and million at year end  generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases 
in some instances the company has reciprocal collateralization agreements with counterparties regarding fair value positions in excess of certain thresholds 
these agreements call for the posting of collateral in the form of cash  treasury securities or letters of credit if a net liability position to the company or our counterparties exceeds a certain amount 
as of december   we had posted collateral of million in the form of cash  which was reflected as an increase in accounts receivable  net on the consolidated balance sheet 
there was no collateral balance requirement at january  in addition to the commodity derivative instruments discussed above  we use long term contracts with suppliers to manage a portion of the price exposure associated with future purchases of certain raw materials  including rice  sugar  cartonboard  and corrugated boxes 
it should be noted the exclusion of these contracts from the analysis above could be a limitation in assessing the net market risk of our company
