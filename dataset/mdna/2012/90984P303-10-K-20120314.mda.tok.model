item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the following discussion is intended to provide insight into the financial condition and results of operations of united and its subsidiaries and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
operating loss and operating loss per diluted share are non gaap performance measures 
united s management believes that operating performance is useful in analyzing the company s financial performance trends since it excludes items that are non recurring in nature and therefore most of the discussion in this section will refer to operating performance measures 
a reconciliation of these operating performance measures to gaap performance measures is included in the table on pages and united continues to experience challenges in its loan portfolio caused by the weakened housing and commercial real estate markets 
the fragile economic conditions that spread beyond the housing market  causing prolonged levels of high unemployment  negatively impacted united s loan portfolio again in united reported a net loss of million in  which primarily reflects the credit losses taken in the first quarter associated with the execution of a plan to sell approximately million in substandard and nonperforming loans  and to accelerate the disposition of approximately million in foreclosed properties the problem asset disposition plan 
this compared to a net loss of million in  which included non cash charges of million for goodwill impairment  a tax charge of million to recognize a full valuation allowance on united s net deferred tax asset  a million partial fraud loss recovery  as well as a million loss from the transaction with fletcher  which is described on page diluted operating loss from continuing operations per common share was for the year ended december   compared with a diluted operating loss per common share of for the goodwill impairment charge represented of loss per share in and the partial fraud loss recovery resulted in an increase in earnings of 
per share  bringing the total loss in to per share 
united s approach to managing through the challenging economic cycle has been to aggressively deal with credit problems and dispose of troubled assets quickly  taking losses as necessary 
as a result  united s provision for loan losses was million in compared with million in the third quarter loan loss provision included a million loan loss provision related to united classifying its largest lending relationship 
net charge offs for were million compared with million in during the first quarter of  in conjunction with a bulk sale transaction the bulk loan sale  performing substandard loans with a carrying amount of million and nonperforming loans with a carrying amount of million were collectively written down to the expected sales proceeds of million 
as part of the bulk loan sale  united recognized net charge offs of million related to the transfer of loans to the held for sale classification in the first quarter 
the bulk loan sale was completed on april  and the proceeds from the sale were greater than originally estimated  resulting in a reduction of second quarter charge offs of million 
operating provision for loan losses and operating net charge offs for of million and million  respectively  excluded the partial recovery of million from a fraud loss incurred in related to two failed real estate developments in western north carolina 
as of december   united s allowance for loan losses was million  or of loans compared to million  or of loans at the end of nonperforming assets of million  which excludes assets that are covered by loss sharing agreements with the fdic  were of total assets at december   compared to as of december  the decrease in this ratio was due to the execution of the problem asset disposition plan  where united sold substandard and nonperforming loans  and accelerated the disposition of approximately million in foreclosed properties  as well as a general improving trend in credit quality indicators 
taxable equivalent net interest revenue was million for  compared to million for the same period in the million  or decrease in net interest revenue  was primarily due to lower average loan balances and a basis point decrease in the net interest margin 
average loans for declined million from the decrease in net interest revenue was substantially offset by lower deposit costs 
net interest margin decreased basis points from in to in interest reversals on performing loans that were moved to held for sale during the first quarter of account for three basis points of the basis point decrease 
over the past year  united has maintained above normal levels of liquidity 
the level of excess liquidity peaked in and lowered the margin by approximately basis points 
in order to reduce the amount of excess liquidity  united reduced the level of time deposits and brokered deposits by lowering rates on retail certificates of deposit and other deposit products and allowing the run off of maturing brokered deposits 

table of contents operating fee revenue of million was up million  or  from overdraft fees declined million  or  as a result of regulatory changes requiring customer consent before using overdraft services 
this decline was partially offset by a million increase in atm and debit card fee income 
mortgage loan and related fees decreased million compared to the prior year  due to lower origination volumes that were driven by the changing interest rate environment that in turn  affected refinancing activity 
the year over year increase in other fee revenue was attributable to the acceleration of deferred gains related to the ineffectiveness of terminated cash flow hedges  especially during the second quarter of hedge ineffectiveness gains recognized in were million compared with million in for  operating expenses of million  were up million  or  from the same period in the prior year 
this comparison excludes the million loss on the sale of nonperforming assets to fletcher in the second quarter of and the million goodwill impairment charge in the third quarter of the increase in operating expenses in was primarily due to an increase in foreclosed property costs in anticipation of the bulk loan sale and other accelerated asset dispositions 
for  foreclosed property costs of million were up million compared to at the end of  united held million in short term investments compared to million at the end of  as part of its continued emphasis on reducing excess liquidity 
loans at december  were billion  down million from the end of  due primarily to the bulk loan sale in the first quarter as well as a general weak loan demand 
totaling million  residential construction loans at december  represented of outstanding loans  down from at the end of  a decrease of million 
deposits were down million to billion  as united focused on reducing interest expense by allowing attrition in higher rate certificates of deposit by not aggressively competing with rates 
united s focus was to increase low cost core transaction deposits which grew million in  excluding public funds deposits 
at the end of  total equity capital was million  up million from december  reflecting the capital raise completed in the first quarter of  offset by the net loss of at december   all of united s regulatory capital ratios were above well capitalized levels 
critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of united and its subsidiaries are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
the more critical accounting and reporting policies include united s accounting for the allowance for loan losses  fair value measurements and income taxes 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates or judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes 
these estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates or judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates or judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon future events 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record the valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management primarily through the use of internal cash flow modeling techniques 
the most significant accounting policies for united are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this financial review  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
management views critical accounting policies to be those that are highly dependent on subjective or complex judgments  estimates and assumptions  and where changes in those estimates and assumptions could have a significant effect on the financial statements 
management considers the following accounting policies to be critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
estimating the amount of the allowance for loan losses requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on non impaired loans based on historical loss experience  management s evaluation of the current loan portfolio  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheet 
loan losses are charged against the allowance  while recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the allowance 
a provision for loan losses is charged to operations based on management s periodic evaluation of the factors previously mentioned  as well as other pertinent factors 

table of contents the allowance for loan losses consists of an allocated component and an unallocated component 
the components of the allowance for loan losses represent an estimate 
the allocated component of the allowance for loan losses reflects expected losses resulting from analyses developed through specific credit allocations for individual loans and historical loss experience for each loan category 
the specific credit allocations are based on impairment analyses of all nonaccrual loans over  accruing substandard loans in relationships over million and troubled debt restructured loans tdrs  which are all considered impaired loans 
these analyses involve judgment in estimating the amount of loss associated with specific loans  including estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and collateral values 
the historical loss element is determined using the weighted average of actual losses incurred over the prior eight quarters for each type of loan  updated quarterly 
the weighted average is weighted toward the most recent quarters loss experience 
the historical loss experience is adjusted for known changes in economic conditions and credit quality trends such as changes in the amount of past due and nonperforming loans 
the resulting loss allocation factors are applied to the balance of each type of loan after removing the balance of impaired loans and other specifically allocated loans from each category 
the loss allocation factors are updated quarterly 
the allocated component of the allowance for loan losses also includes consideration of concentrations of credit and changes in portfolio mix 
the unallocated portion of the allowance reflects management s estimate of probable inherent but undetectable losses within the portfolio due to uncertainties in economic conditions  delays in obtaining information  including unfavorable information about a borrower s financial condition  the difficulty in identifying triggering events that correlate to subsequent loss rates  and risk factors that have not yet manifested themselves in loss allocation factors 
in addition  the unallocated allowance includes a component that accounts for the inherent imprecision in loan loss estimation based on historical loss experience as a result of united s growth through acquisitions  which have expanded the geographic footprint in which it operates  and changed its portfolio mix in recent years 
also  loss data representing a complete economic cycle is not available for all sectors 
uncertainty surrounding the strength and timing of economic cycles also affects estimates of loss 
the historical losses used in developing loss allocation factors may not be representative of actual losses inherent in the portfolio 
there are many factors affecting the allowance for loan losses  some are quantitative while others require qualitative judgment 
although management believes its processes for determining the allowance adequately considers all the potential factors that could potentially result in credit losses  the process includes subjective elements and may be susceptible to significant change  including as a result of regulators disagreeing with our judgment 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provision for loan losses could be required that could adversely affect earnings or financial position in future periods 
additional information on united s loan portfolio and allowance for loan losses can be found in the sections of management s discussion and analysis titled asset quality and risk elements and nonperforming assets and in the sections of part i  item titled lending policy and loan review and nonperforming assets 
note to the consolidated financial statements includes additional information on united s accounting policies related to the allowance for loan losses 
fair value measurements united s impaired loans and foreclosed assets may be measured and carried at fair value  the determination of which requires management to make assumptions  estimates and judgments 
at december   the percentage of total assets measured at fair value was 
see note fair value in the consolidated financial statements herein for additional disclosures regarding the fair value of our assets and liabilities 
when a loan is considered impaired  a specific valuation allowance is allocated  if necessary  so that the loan is reported net  at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan s existing rate or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral 
in addition  foreclosed assets are carried at the lower of cost  fair value  less cost to sell  or listed selling price less cost to sell  following foreclosure 
fair value is defined by gaap as the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
gaap further defines an orderly transaction as a transaction that assumes exposure to the market for a period prior to the measurement date to allow for marketing activities that are usual and customary for transactions involving such assets it is not a forced transaction for example  a forced liquidation or distress sale 
recently in the bank s markets there have been very few transactions in the type of assets which represent the vast majority of the bank s impaired loans and foreclosed properties which reflect orderly transactions as so defined 
instead  most transactions in comparable assets have been distressed sales not indicative of fair value 
accordingly  the determination of fair value in the current environment is difficult and more subjective than it would be in a stable real estate environment 
although management believes its processes for determining the value of these assets are appropriate factors and allow united to arrive at a fair value  the processes require management judgment and assumptions and the value of such assets at the time they are revalued or divested may be significantly different from management s determination of fair value 
in addition  because of this increased subjectivity in fair value determinations  there is greater than usual grounds for differences in opinions  which may result in increased disagreements between management and the bank s regulators  disagreements which could cause the bank to change its judgments about fair value 

table of contents the fair values for available for sale securities are generally based upon quoted market prices or observable market prices for similar instruments 
united utilizes a third party pricing service in determining the fair value of its securities portfolio 
the pricing service uses observable inputs when available including benchmark yields  reported trades  broker dealer quotes  issuer spreads  benchmark securities  bids and offers 
these values take into account recent market activity as well as other market observable data such as interest rate  spread and prepayment information 
when market observable data is not available  which generally occurs due to the lack of liquidity for certain securities  the valuation of the security is subjective and may involve substantial judgment by management 
as of december   united had approximately  of available for sale securities valued using unobservable inputs 
this amount represents less than 
of total assets 
united periodically reviews available for sale securities that are in an unrealized loss position to determine whether other than temporary impairment exists 
an unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis 
the primary factors united considers in determining whether impairment is other than temporary are long term expectations and recent experience regarding principal and interest payments  and united s ability and intent to hold the security until the amortized cost basis is recovered 
united uses derivatives primarily to manage interest rate risk 
the fair values of derivative financial instruments are determined based on quoted market prices  dealer quotes and internal pricing models that are primarily sensitive to market observable data 
united mitigates the credit risk by subjecting counterparties to credit reviews and approvals similar to those used in making loans and other extensions of credit 
in addition  certain counterparties are required to provide collateral to united when their unsecured loss positions exceed certain negotiated limits 
income tax accounting income tax liabilities or assets are established for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year 
deferred tax liabilities and assets are also established for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns 
a deferred tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and deductions that can be carried forward used in future years 
the valuation of current and deferred tax liabilities and assets is considered critical as it requires management to make estimates based on provisions of the enacted tax laws 
the assessment of tax assets and liabilities involves the use of estimates  assumptions  interpretations  and judgments concerning certain accounting pronouncements and federal and state tax codes 
there can be no assurance that future events  such as court decisions or positions of regulatory agencies and federal and state taxing authorities  will not differ from management s current assessment  the impact of which could be significant to the consolidated results of operations and reported earnings 
at december   united reported no net deferred tax asset  due to a full valuation allowance of million 
accounting standards codification topic  income taxes  requires that companies assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against their deferred tax assets based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard 
united s management considers both positive and negative evidence 
in making such judgments  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
because of the significant weight given to recent losses  management determined that a full valuation allowance was necessary 
regulatory risk based capital rules limit the amount of deferred tax assets that a bank or bank holding company can include in tier capital 
generally  deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income are limited to the lesser of i the amount of such deferred tax assets that the bank expects to realize within one year of the calendar quarter end date  based on its projected future taxable income for that year or ii of the amount of the bank s tier capital 
therefore united s realization of its deferred tax assets is dependent upon future taxable income 
accordingly  united has excluded the entire balance of its net deferred tax asset from tier capital in calculating its risk based capital ratios 
mergers and acquisitions united selectively engages in the evaluation of strategic partnerships 
mergers and acquisitions present opportunities to enter new markets with an established presence and a capable management team already in place 
united employs certain criteria to ensure that any merger or acquisition candidate meets strategic growth and earnings objectives that will build future franchise value for shareholders 
additionally  the criteria include ensuring that management of a potential partner shares united s community banking philosophy of premium service quality and operates in attractive markets with excellent opportunities for further organic growth 

table of contents as part of this strategy  on june   ucb purchased substantially all the assets and assumed substantially all the liabilities of southern community bank scb from the federal deposit insurance corporation as receiver of scb 
scb operated five commercial banking branches on the south side of atlanta in fayetteville  peachtree city  locust grove and newnan  georgia 
the transaction resulted in a cash payment of million from the fdic to ucb 
further  ucb and the fdic entered into loss sharing agreements regarding future losses incurred on loans and foreclosed loan collateral existing at june  under the terms of the loss sharing agreements  the fdic will absorb percent of losses and share percent of loss recoveries on the first million of losses  and absorb percent of losses and share in percent of loss recoveries exceeding million 
the term for loss sharing on to family loans is ten years  while the term for loss sharing on all other loans is five years 
as a result of the acquisition  united recorded an million gain as a component of fee revenue in the consolidated statement of operations 
the amount of gain is equal to the amount by which the fair value of the assets purchased exceeded the fair value of liabilities assumed 
the results of operations of scb are included in the consolidated statement of operations from the acquisition date of june  united will continue to evaluate potential transactions as they are presented  including acquisitions of failed banks to the extent we are permitted to bid on them 
discontinued operations effective march   united sold its brintech subsidiary 
as a result  the operations of brintech are being accounted for as a discontinued operation 
all revenue  including the gain from the sale  expenses and income taxes relating to brintech have been deconsolidated from the consolidated statement of operations and are presented on one line titled loss income from discontinued operations for all periods presented 
because brintech s assets  liabilities and cash flows were not material to the consolidated balance sheet and statement of cash flows  no such adjustments have been made to those financial statements 
gaap reconciliation and explanation this form k contains non gaap financial measures determined by methods other than in accordance with gaap 
such non gaap financial measures include  among others  the following operating revenue  operating expense  operating loss income  operating earnings loss per share and operating earnings loss per diluted share 
management uses these non gaap financial measures because it believes it is useful for evaluating our operations and performance over periods of time  as well as in managing and evaluating our business and in discussions about our operations and performance 
management believes these non gaap financial measures provide users of our financial information with a meaningful measure for assessing our financial results and credit trends  as well as comparison to financial results for prior periods 
these non gaap financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with gaap and may not be comparable to other similarly titled financial measures used by other companies 
a reconciliation of these operating performance measures to gaap performance measures is included on the tables on pages and in  united recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million in the third quarter 
also in  united received a partial recovery of million  net of recovery costs  in the fourth quarter resulting from fraud losses incurred in relating to two failed real estate developments near spruce pine  north carolina 
in  united recorded non cash goodwill impairment charges of million and million during the third and first quarters  respectively 
in addition  united recorded severance costs of million during the first quarter of and a gain on the acquisition of scb in the amount of million during the second quarter of in  united recorded a special provision for loan losses and related charge offs of million as a result of fraud related loan losses associated with the two failed real estate developments near spruce pine  north carolina 
net operating loss excludes the effect of the goodwill impairment charge of million and the million fraud loss partial recovery in  the goodwill impairment charges of million  the million gain on acquisition  and the million in severance costs in  and the fraud related loan loss in  because management believes that the circumstances leading to those items were isolated  non recurring events and do not reflect overall trends in united s earnings and financial performance 
management believes this non gaap net operating loss provides users of united s financial information with a meaningful measure for assessing united s financial results and credit trends  as well as comparison to financial results for prior periods

table of contents transaction with fletcher international description of transaction on april   the bank entered into an asset purchase and sale agreement the asset purchase agreement with fletcher inc and five separate limited liability companies llcs affiliates of fletcher inc for the purpose of acquiring nonperforming assets under the asset purchase agreement 
united has no ownership interest in the llcs 
the asset sale transaction was completed on april  with the bank selling nonperforming commercial and residential construction loans and foreclosed properties having a carrying value of million in exchange for cash of million and notes receivable for million 
the loans made to the llcs in connection with their respective purchases have the same terms for all six loans 
the loans have an initial term of five years and principal and interest payments are based on a year amortization schedule 
the assets in the llcs are cross pledged as collateral on all six loans 
correspondingly  prepayments on the loans are required as properties are sold in order for the collateral to be released upon sale 
the interest rate during the loan term is fixed at for all loans and  accordingly  each loan was recorded at a discount as the interest rate was considered below market 
at the time the llcs were formed  they were capitalized with sufficient cash to make the required down payment on the purchase and of the purchase price in cash and securities to cover the first three years of required cash flows 
these funds are held in escrow as additional collateral on the loans and cannot be removed by fletcher without united s consent 
the securities that can be held by the llcs are marketable equity securities and funds managed by fletcher affiliates 
carrying costs include debt service payments  servicing fees and other direct costs associated with holding and managing the underlying properties 
cash flow from expected sales of underlying assets loans foreclosed real estate is expected to be sufficient to service the loans for another five to six quarters 
while recent news articles and other sources have questioned the financial health of fletcher and its affiliates  the loans to the llcs have performed according to their contractual terms since inception 
however  during the third quarter of  united determined that the ultimate repayment of the million loan relationship through the sale of the underlying collateral is unlikely due to the lack of sales activity and further decline in real estate values 
as a result  united recorded a loan loss provision of million during the third quarter of and recorded a partial charge off in the same amount during the fourth quarter 
also on april   united and fletcher international ltd 
fletcher ltd  together with fletcher inc and their affiliates  fletcher  entered into a securities purchase agreement the securities purchase agreement pursuant to which fletcher ltd 
agreed to purchase from united  and united agreed to issue and sell to fletcher ltd   shares of united s series c convertible preferred stock  par value per share the convertible preferred stock  at a purchase price of  per share  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the convertible preferred stock will bear interest at an annual rate equal to the lesser of or libor 
if all conditions precedent to fletcher ltd 
s obligations to purchase the convertible preferred stock have been satisfied and fletcher ltd 
had not purchased all of the convertible preferred stock by may   it was required to pay united of the commitment amount not purchased by that date  and it must pay united an additional of any commitment amount not purchased by july  fletcher has paid united million as it had not purchased the series c convertible preferred stock as of may  the penalty payment associated with fletcher s option to purchase preferred stock was considered an equity transaction and was therefore recorded as an increase to capital surplus in shareholders equity 
the convertible preferred stock is redeemable by fletcher ltd 
at any time into common stock or non voting common stock equivalent junior preferred stock junior preferred stock of united  at an equivalent price of per share of common stock equal to  shares of common stock  subject to certain adjustments 
after may   if the closing stock price for united s common stock is above  united has the right to require conversion and it is united s intent to convert all of the then outstanding convertible preferred stock into an equivalent amount of common stock or junior preferred stock 
concurrently with the payment of the million deposit under the asset purchase agreement by fletcher  united granted a warrant to fletcher to purchase junior preferred stock 
the warrant was initially equal to million and was increased to million upon the completion of the asset sale pursuant to the asset purchase agreement 
an additional million warrant will be issued on a dollar for dollar basis by the aggregate dollar amount of the convertible preferred stock purchased under the securities purchase agreement in excess of million 
the million warrant price is equivalent to per common share cash exercise equal to  shares of common stock 
the warrant has a nine year term and expires on may  to date  the warrant has not been exercised 
the million warrant price is equivalent to per common share cash exercise equal to  shares of common stock 
the warrants may only be exercised by net share settlement cashless exercise and are exercisable for nine years from may   subject to limited extension upon certain events specified in the warrant agreement 
all of the warrants settle on a cashless basis and the net shares to be issued to fletcher ltd 
upon exercise of the warrants will be less than the total shares that would have been issuable if the warrants had been exercised for cash payments 
also  as part of the transaction  united and fletcher entered into a servicing agreement whereby united will act as servicer of the nonperforming assets for fletcher in exchange for a servicing fee of basis points 
because the servicing arrangement is considered a normal servicing arrangement and the fee is appropriate for the services provided  united did not recognize a servicing asset or liability related to the servicing agreement 

table of contents accounting treatment although the asset purchase agreement and the securities purchase agreement are two separate agreements  they were accounted for as part of one transaction because they were entered into simultaneously and the securities purchase agreement was dependent upon the sale of nonperforming assets 
united evaluated this transaction to determine whether the transfer should be accounted for as a sale or a secured borrowing and whether the fletcher llcs should be consolidated with united 
when evaluating whether the transfer should be accounted for as a sale  united primarily evaluated whether control had been surrendered  the rights of fletcher to exchange and pledge the assets  and whether united retains effective control  which included evaluating any continuing involvement in the assets 
based on the evaluation  the transfer of assets under the asset purchase agreement meets the definition as a sale under current accounting standards and was accounted for as such 
united further evaluated whether the fletcher llcs should be consolidated which included evaluating whether united has a controlling financial interest and is therefore the primary beneficiary 
this evaluation principally included determining whether united directs the activities that have the most significant impact on the llcs economic performance and whether united has an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be significant to the llcs 
based on that evaluation  the llcs have not been included as part of the consolidated group of subsidiaries in united s consolidated financial statements 
in addition to evaluating the accounting for the transfer of assets  united considered whether the warrant and the option to purchase convertible preferred stock with an additional warrant should be accounted for as liabilities or equity instruments 
in making this evaluation  united considered whether fletcher or any subsequent holders of the instruments could require settlement of the instruments in cash or other assets rather than common or preferred stock 
because the transaction was structured so that the warrants and option to purchase convertible preferred stock and the additional warrant can only be settled through the issuance of common or preferred stock  united concluded that the warrant and option to purchase convertible preferred stock with an additional warrant should be accounted for as equity instruments 
all of the components of the transaction  including all equity instruments issued under the securities purchase agreement and the notes receivable received as consideration from the sale of nonperforming assets were recorded at fair value 
because the value of the equity instruments and assets exchanged in the transaction exceeded the value of the cash and notes receivable received  united recorded a loss of million on the transaction with fletcher 
the table below presents a summary of the assets and equity instruments transferred and received at their respective fair values in thousands  except per share amounts

table of contents notes the million value of the million warrant was determined as of april   the date the terms were agreed to and signed 
the following modeling assumptions were used dividend yield  risk free interest rate  current stock price  term years  and volatility 
although most of the modeling assumptions were based on observable data  because of the subjectivity involved in estimating expected volatility  the valuation is considered level the million value of the option to purchase convertible preferred stock and warrant was determined by an independent valuation firm using a monte carlo simulation method appropriate for valuing complex securities with derivatives 
the model uses  simulations of daily stock price paths using geometric brownian motion and incorporates in a unified way all conversion  exercise and contingency conditions 
because of the significant assumptions involved in the valuation process  not all of which were based on observable data  the valuation is considered to be level the million of nonperforming assets sold were transferred at united s carrying value which had been written down to appraised value 
because the appraisals were based on sales of similar assets observable data  the valuation is considered to be level the million of notes receivable were recorded at their estimated fair value of million  net of a million interest discount  which was determined based on discounted expected cash flows over the term at a rate commensurate with the credit risk inherent in the notes 
the contractual rate on the notes is fixed at for five years 
the discount rate used for purposes of determining the fair value of the notes was based on the terms  structure and risk profile of the notes 
note prepayments were estimated based on the expected marketing times for the underlying collateral since the notes require that principal be reduced as the underlying assets are sold 
the valuation is considered level due to estimated prepayments which have a significant impact on the value and are not based on observable data 
results of operations the remainder of this financial discussion focuses on operating earnings  which excludes the goodwill impairment charge and partial fraud loss recovery in  the goodwill impairment charges  gain on acquisition and severance costs in  and the fraud related provision in  except for the discussion of income taxes 
operating and gaap earnings were the same in and for additional information on operating earnings measures  refer to the preceding section on non gaap financial measures 
there are a few large items included in operating earnings that are generally nonrecurring in nature that affect comparability between periods 
although credit losses in all periods were elevated  reflecting the weak economic cycle of the past four years  in  united s credit losses reflected the problem asset disposition plan 
that plan included the bulk loan sale which removed united s most challenging problem assets and resulted in a significant decrease in the level of problem assets 
as a result  the problem asset disposition plan accelerated united s return to profitability following the first quarter capital transaction 
in addition  operating earnings in included a million charge to operating expense resulting from the fletcher transaction  which increased the net loss per share by  and the million income tax expense related to establishment of a full deferred tax valuation allowance

table of contents net interest revenue taxable equivalent net interest revenue the difference between the interest earned on assets and the interest paid on deposits and other liabilities is the single largest component of united s revenue 
united actively manages this revenue source to provide optimal levels of revenue while balancing interest rate  credit  and liquidity risks 
taxable equivalent net interest revenue totaled million in  a decrease of million  or  from the level recorded in taxable equivalent net interest revenue for decreased million  or less than  from the level 
the decreases in net interest revenue in compared to and in compared to were due primarily to lower levels of average loan balances which were substantially offset by lower rates on deposits and a more favorable deposit mix 
united continued its focus on loan and deposit pricing  in an effort to maintain a steady level of net interest revenue 
the average yield on loans decreased basis points reflecting the continuing effect of the low interest rate environment 
average loans decreased million in  or  from the decrease in the loan portfolio was primarily attributable to weak loan demand as well as the bulk loan sale completed in april loan charge offs  foreclosure activity and management s efforts to rebalance the loan portfolio by reducing the concentration of residential construction loans have also contributed to declining loan balances 
while loan balances have declined  united continues to make new loans 
during  united made million in new loans  primarily commercial and small business loans in north georgia  the atlanta msa and coastal georgia 
average interest earning assets for the year decreased million  or  from for the year ended december   average loans decreased million compared to  however this decrease was offset by a million increase in average investment securities 
the increase in the securities portfolio was due to purchases of floating rate mortgage backed securities in an effort to temporarily invest excess liquidity  including the proceeds from the new capital raised at the end of the first quarter of average interest bearing liabilities in decreased million  or  from the prior year due to the rolling off of higher cost brokered deposits and certificates of deposit as funding needs decreased 
the average yield on interest earning assets for was down basis points from in a significant contributing factor to the decrease in the yield on interest earning assets was due to the build up of excess liquidity resulting in a shift in earning asset mix from loans  which generally yield a higher rate than other asset classes  to temporary investments which have relatively low yields 
in light of the weak economic environment  in late  united sought to maintain above normal levels of liquidity by entering into brokered deposit arrangements and temporarily investing the proceeds in floating rate mortgage backed securities at a slightly negative spread 
liquidity levels increased further as a result of the first quarter capital transaction 
following the capital transaction  management has sought to reduce liquidity levels 
the average cost of interest bearing liabilities for the year ended december   was compared to for the same period in  reflecting united s concerted efforts to reduce deposit pricing 
also contributing to the overall lower rate on interest bearing liabilities was a shift in the mix of deposits away from more expensive time deposits toward lower rate transaction deposits 
united s shrinking balance sheet also permitted the reduction of more expensive wholesale borrowings 
the banking industry uses two key ratios to measure relative profitability of net interest revenue the net interest spread and the net interest margin 
the net interest spread measures the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the interest rate spread eliminates the effect of non interest bearing deposits and other non interest bearing funding sources and gives a direct perspective on the effect of market interest rate movements 
the net interest margin is an indication of the profitability of a company s overall balance sheet management activities and is defined as net interest revenue as a percentage of total average interest earning assets  which includes the positive effect of funding a portion of interest earning assets with customers non interest bearing deposits and with shareholders equity 
for  and  united s net interest spread was   and  respectively  while the net interest margin was   and  respectively 
interest reversals on performing loans classified as held for sale as part of the bulk loan sale reduced net interest margin by three basis points in the combined effect of the lower yield on earning assets caused mostly by the shift in earning asset mix from loans to investment securities  partially offset by the lower cost of interest bearing liabilities  resulted in the net interest margin decreasing basis points from to the buildup of excess liquidity also  which lowered the margin by basis points in compared to basis points in  contributed to the decrease in the net interest margin 
the improvement in net interest margin from to reflected management s efforts to maximize earnings by focusing on loan and deposit pricing 
united intensified its focus on loan pricing to ensure it was being adequately compensated for the credit risk it was taking

provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is based on management s evaluation of losses inherent in the loan portfolio and corresponding analysis of the allowance for loan losses at the end of each reporting period 
the operating provision for loan losses was million in  compared with million in  and million in the operating provision is million higher than the gaap provision for loan losses which includes the partial recovery of the fraud loss provision recorded in as an annualized percentage of average outstanding loans  the operating provision was  and  respectively  in  and the amount of provision recorded in each year was the amount required such that the total allowance for loan losses reflected the appropriate balance  in the estimation of management  and was sufficient to cover inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
during the third quarter of  united recorded an additional loan loss provision of million specifically related to the classification of its largest lending relationship 
in  the increase in the provision for loan losses compared to a year ago was primarily due to the increased level of charge offs in the first quarter of recorded in conjunction with the problem asset disposition plan and transfer of loans to the held for sale category in anticipation of the bulk loan sale 
the operating ratio of net loan charge offs to average outstanding loans for was  compared with for  excluding the million partial recovery  and for as the residential construction and housing markets have struggled  it has been difficult for many builders and developers to obtain cash flow needed to service debt from selling lots and houses 
this deterioration of the residential construction and housing market was the primary factor that resulted in higher credit losses and an increase in nonperforming assets over the last four years 
although a majority of the loan charge offs have been within the residential construction and development portion of the portfolio  credit quality deterioration has migrated to other loan categories as pressure resulting from economic conditions has persisted and unemployment levels have remained high throughout united s markets

the decrease in overdraft fees was partially offset by million in higher atm and debit card interchange revenue 
mortgage loan and related fees of million were down million  or  from in  united closed  mortgage loans totaling million compared with  loans totaling million in origination volumes were driven by the changing interest rate environment which had a significant impact on refinancing activity 
substantially all these originated residential mortgages were sold into the secondary market  including the right to service the loans 
brokerage fees of million increased  or  from the increase in brokerage fees was due to improving market conditions from those in additionally  a portion of united s brokerage fee revenue is derived from the value of assets under management which increased with the overall improvement in the market  further contributing to the increased revenue 
united recognized net securities gains of  and million during and  respectively 
the net gain was net of  in impairment charges in the first quarter of  on trust preferred securities of a bank whose financial condition had deteriorated 
the impairment charge was more than offset by realized gains from securities sales 
united also recognized losses from the prepayment of fhlb advances 
the losses were part of the same balance sheet management activities that resulted in the securities gains 
the securities gains and prepayment losses are mostly offsetting and had little net impact on financial results in the periods incurred

in  united recognized million in income from hedge ineffectiveness compared with million in income from hedge ineffectiveness in most of the hedge ineffectiveness in and related to terminated cash flow hedges where the gains realized on the terminated positions are being deferred over the original term of the derivative instrument 
the ineffectiveness  which is caused by a decrease in qualifying prime based loans  results in the accelerated recognition of the deferred gains

foreclosed property expenses related to foreclosure and carrying costs for was million  a decrease of million from while foreclosed property expenses have remained elevated throughout the weak economic cycle  the decrease from is due to the lower level of foreclosed properties 
the foreclosure and carrying costs category includes legal fees  property taxes  marketing costs  utility services  maintenance and repair charges

the tax benefit included the reversal of previously established reserves for uncertain tax positions of million as a result of the tax returns upon which the tax positions were claimed were no longer subject to audit as a result of statute expiration and due to the settlement of a state tax dispute 
because of the full valuation allowance on united s net deferred tax asset  united did not recognize a tax benefit on its pre tax loss in other than adjustments to its reserve for uncertain tax positions 
in the fourth quarter of  united resolved a tax dispute with a state taxing authority relative to an issue identified during a routine audit 
united had fully reserved for the issue as an uncertain tax position 
the resolution resulted in the release of the reserve which increased the fourth quarter tax benefit by approximately million 
at december   united had no net deferred tax assets due to a full valuation allowance of million 
accounting standards codification topic  income taxes  requires that companies assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against their deferred tax assets based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard 
management considers both positive and negative evidence and analyzes changes in near term market conditions as well as other factors which may impact future operating results 
in making such judgments  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
the deferred tax assets are analyzed quarterly for changes affecting realizabilty 
because management has determined that the objective negative evidence outweighs the positive evidence  management has established a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets 
management will continue to evaluate and weigh the positive and negative evidence going forward and  if the weight of evidence shifts such that the positive evidence outweighs the negative evidence  the valuation allowance will be adjusted or completely reversed as appropriate 
in february  united adopted a tax benefits preservation plan designed to protect its ability to utilize its substantial tax assets 
those tax assets include net operating losses that it could utilize in certain circumstances to offset taxable income and reduce its federal income tax liability and the future tax benefits from potential net unrealized built in losses 
united s ability to use its tax benefits would be substantially limited if it were to experience an ownership change as defined under section of the internal revenue code 
in general  an ownership change would occur if united s percent shareholders  as defined under section  collectively increase their ownership in united by more than over a rolling three year period 
the tax benefits preservation plan is designed to reduce the likelihood that united will experience an ownership change by discouraging any person or group from becoming a beneficial owner of or more of united s common stock then outstanding 
in connection with the tax benefits preservation plan in february  united entered into a share exchange agreement with the elm ridge parties to transfer to the company  shares of united s common stock in exchange for  shares of the company s series d preferred shares and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
prior to entering into the share exchange agreement  collectively  the elm ridge parties were united s largest shareholder 
by exchanging the elm ridge parties common stock for the series d preferred shares and warrants  united eliminated its only percent shareholder and  as a result  obtained further protection against an ownership change under section

total loans averaged billion in  compared with billion in  a decrease of 
the decrease primarily results from the problem asset disposition plan although weak loan demand within united s market and management s efforts to reduce united s residential construction concentration also contributed 
at december   total loans were billion  a decrease of million  or  from december  the rate of loan growth began to decline in the first quarter of  and the balances have continued to decline through the subsequent years 
the decrease in the loan portfolio began with deterioration in the residential construction and housing markets and continued through most of in the fourth quarter of  the loan portfolio began to stabilize indicating a possible inflection point upon which loan growth is expected to return 
the deterioration over the past five years resulted in part from an oversupply of lot inventory  houses and land within united s markets  which further slowed construction activities and acquisition and development projects 
the resulting recession that began in the housing market led to high rates of unemployment that resulted in stress in the other segments of united s loan portfolio

additional information on united s credit administration function is included in item under the heading loan review and nonperforming assets 
united classifies performing loans as substandard when there is a well defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the repayment by the borrower and there is a distinct possibility that united could sustain some loss if the deficiency is not corrected

reviews of substandard performing and non performing loans  troubled debt restructures  past due loans and larger credits  are conducted on a weekly  monthly or quarterly basis with management and are designed to identify risk migration and potential charges to the allowance for loan losses 
these reviews are performed by the lending officers and the loan review department  and also consider such factors as the financial strength of borrowers  the value of the applicable collateral  past loan loss experience  anticipated loan losses  changes in risk profile  prevailing economic conditions and other factors 
in addition to united s internal loan review  united also uses external loan review to ensure the independence of the loan review process 
the provision for loan losses charged to earnings was based upon management s judgment of the amount necessary to maintain the allowance at a level appropriate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
the amount each quarter is dependent upon many factors  including growth and changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  net charge offs  delinquencies  management s assessment of loan portfolio quality  the value of collateral  and other macro economic factors and trends 
the evaluation of these factors is performed quarterly by management through an analysis of the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses 
the decreases in the provision and the stabilization of the level of the allowance for loan losses compared to the previous periods reflects stabilizing trends in substandard loans  leading to an expectation that charge off levels will continue to decline 
in addition  the million partial recovery in the fourth quarter of of a previously charged off loan increased the total allowance for loan losses by that amount  thereby reducing the level of loan loss provision needed in the allocation of the allowance for loan losses is based on historical data  subjective judgment and estimates and  therefore  is not necessarily indicative of the specific amounts or loan categories in which charge offs may ultimately occur 
due to the imprecise nature of the loan loss estimation process and the effects of changing conditions  these risk attributes may not be adequately captured in the data related to the formula based loan loss components used to determine allocations in united s analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
consequently  management believes that the unallocated allowance appropriately reflects probable inherent but undetected losses in the loan portfolio

at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  or of total loans  compared with million  or of loans at december  the decrease in the allowance for loan losses is consistent with the decrease in classified loans resulting from the execution of the problem asset disposition plan  including the bulk loan sale which reduced the amount of loss remaining in the loan portfolio 
during the third quarter of  united recorded a provision for loan losses of million related to classifying its largest lending relationship to nonaccrual status and recorded a million partial charge off during the fourth quarter 

table of contents management believes that the allowance for loan losses at december  reflects the losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
this assessment involves uncertainty and judgment  therefore  the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses cannot be determined with precision and may be subject to change in future periods 
the amount of any change could be significant if management s assessment of loan quality or collateral values change substantially with respect to one or more loan relationships or portfolio categories 
in addition  bank regulatory authorities  as part of their periodic examination of the bank  may require adjustments to the provision for loan losses in future periods if  in their opinion  the results of their review warrant such additions

nonperforming assets  which include nonperforming loans and foreclosed real estate  totaled million at december   compared with million at december  united sold million and million respectively  of foreclosed properties during and both of these events helped lower the balance of foreclosed properties by in united s policy is to place loans on nonaccrual status when  in the opinion of management  the principal and interest on a loan is not likely to be repaid in accordance with the loan terms or when the loan becomes days past due and is not well secured and in the process of collection 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against current interest revenue 
interest payments received on nonaccrual loans are applied as a reduction of principal 
there were no commitments to lend additional funds to customers whose loans were on nonaccrual status at december   although in certain isolated cases  united executed forbearance agreements whereby united will continue to fund construction loans to completion as long as the borrower meets the conditions of the forbearance agreement 
the table below summarizes nonperforming assets at year end for the last five years 
it excludes assets acquired through the acquisition of scb in that are covered by the loss sharing agreement with the fdic 
these assets have been excluded from the review of nonperforming assets  as the loss sharing agreement with the fdic and purchase price adjustments to reflect credit losses  effectively eliminate the likelihood of recognizing losses on the covered assets

investment securities the composition of the investment securities portfolio reflects united s investment strategy of maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity while providing a relatively stable source of revenue 
the investment securities portfolio also provides a balance to interest rate risk and credit risk in other categories of the balance sheet  while providing a vehicle for the investment of available funds  furnishing liquidity  and supplying securities to pledge as required collateral for certain deposits and borrowings  including repurchase agreements 
total investment securities at december  increased million from a year ago 
the increase in the securities portfolio was a result of a buildup of liquidity resulting partially from strong core deposit growth with little loan demand to invest the proceeds and the proceeds from the capital transaction that closed in the first quarter and the bulk loan sale that closed in the second quarter 
in addition  united had sought to maintain above normal amounts of liquidity due to the uncertain economy 
united invested the proceeds from deposits in floating rate mortgage backed securities 
united chose floating rate securities because they have less market risk in the event rates begin to rise 
during the second quarter of  united transferred securities available for sale with a fair value of million to held to maturity 
the transferred securities are those that united has the ability and positive intent to hold until maturity 
generally  the transferred securities had longer durations and were more susceptible to market price volatility due to changes in interest rates 
at december  and december   united had securities held to maturity with a carrying value of million and million  respectively  and securities available for sale totaling billion and billion  respectively 
at december  and  the securities portfolio represented approximately and of total assets  respectively 
at december   the effective duration of the investment portfolio based on expected maturities was years compared with years at december

mortgage backed securities rely on the underlying pools of mortgage loans to provide a cash flow of principal and interest 
the actual maturities of these securities will differ from the contractual maturities because the loans underlying the security can prepay 
decreases in interest rates will generally cause an acceleration of prepayment levels 
in a declining interest rate environment  united may not be able to reinvest the proceeds from these prepayments in assets that have comparable yields 
in a rising rate environment  the opposite occurs and prepayments tend to slow and the weighted average life extends 
this is referred to as extension risk  which can lead to lower levels of liquidity due to the delay of cash receipts  and can result in the holding of a below market yielding asset for a longer period of time 
at december   united had of its total investment securities portfolio in mortgage backed securities  compared with at december  due to a lack of loan demand  united continued to purchase mortgage backed securities in order to obtain a favorable yield with low risk 
in  united reinvested the proceeds of maturing fixed rate mortgage backed securities in floating rate collateralized mortgage obligations in order to avoid exposure to significant extension risk 
united did not have securities of any issuer in excess of of equity at year end or  excluding us government issues

goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the premium paid for acquired companies above the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including separately identifiable intangible assets 
as a result of the significant drop in united s stock price during the third quarter of  united conducted an interim goodwill impairment test to determine if the stock price decline might indicate goodwill was impaired 
united s third quarter interim impairment test indicated that goodwill was in fact impaired and united recorded a charge to earnings for the entire remaining balance of million 
in performing the interim impairment test  united engaged the services of a national third party valuation expert who employed commonly used valuation techniques including an earnings approach that considered discounted future expected cash earnings and three market approaches 
the third quarter impairment charge followed two earlier impairment charges in the first and third quarters of

there were no events or circumstances that lead management to believe that any impairment exists in united s other intangible assets 
deposits united initiated several programs beginning in early to improve core earnings by growing customer transaction deposit accounts and lowering overall pricing on deposit balances to improve its net interest margin and to increase net interest revenue 
the programs were successful in increasing core transaction deposit accounts and reducing more costly time deposit balances  as united s funding needs decreased due to lower loan demand 
united has continued to pursue customer transaction deposits by stressing its high customer satisfaction scores 
total average deposits for were billion  a decrease of million  or  from average non interest bearing demand deposit accounts increased million  or  due to the success of core deposit programs 
also impacted by the programs were now  money market and savings accounts of billion on average for  which increased million  or  from at december   total deposits were billion compared with billion at the end of  a decrease of million  or 
average time deposits for  including brokered time deposits  were billion  down from billion in united continued to offer low rates on certificates of deposit  allowing the balances to decline as united s funding needs declined due to weak loan demand 
additional liquidity also allowed united to reduce brokered deposits  which totaled million at december   compared with million at december  the following table sets forth the scheduled maturities of time deposits of  and greater and brokered time deposits

fhlb advances outstanding at december  had fixed interest rates ranging up to

united will prepay advances from time to time as funding needs change 
additional information regarding fhlb advances  including scheduled maturities  is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   united had million in repurchase agreements reported as federal funds purchased  repurchase agreements  and other short term borrowings in the consolidated balance sheet  compared to million outstanding at december  united takes advantage of these additional sources of liquidity when rates are favorable compared to other forms of short term borrowings  such as fhlb advances and brokered deposits 

table of contents liquidity management the objective of liquidity management is to ensure that sufficient funding is available  at reasonable cost  to meet ongoing operational cash needs and to take advantage of revenue producing opportunities as they arise 
while the desired level of liquidity will vary depending on a number of factors  it is the primary goal of united to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity in all expected economic environments 
united s liquidity policy requires contingent liquidity reserves to cover expected funding needs for a period of twelve months 
liquidity is defined as the ability of a bank to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities 
liquidity management involves maintaining united s ability to meet the daily cash flow requirements of the bank s customers  both depositors and borrowers 
in addition  because united is a separate entity and apart from the bank  it must provide for its own liquidity 
united is responsible for the payment of dividends declared for its common and preferred shareholders  and interest and principal on any outstanding debt or trust preferred securities 
because substantially all of united s liquidity is obtained from subsidiary service fees and dividends from the bank  which are limited by applicable law and the bank mou  united currently has limited internal capital resources to meet these obligations 
united has not received a dividend from the bank since and does not anticipate receiving dividends from the bank until united deferred the payment of interest on our trust preferred securities and dividends on our preferred stock during the first quarter of as a result of such deferrals  united could not pay dividends on any of common or preferred stock or trust preferred securities until all accrued and unpaid amounts under the deferred securities had been paid 
effective april   united received approval to make payments for currently payable and previously deferred dividends and interest on its preferred stock and trust preferred securities 
since then  united has continued to receive quarterly approvals of all payments  including the fourth quarter of and first quarter of additionally  the holding company mou requires  among other things  that united ensures that the bank functions in a safe and sound manner 
united believes it is in compliance with all requirements of the holding company mou and the bank mou 
the primary objectives of asset liability management are to provide for adequate liquidity in order to meet the needs of customers and to maintain an optimal balance between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities  to optimize interest revenue 
daily monitoring of the sources and uses of funds is necessary to maintain a position that meets both requirements 
the asset portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity primarily through loan sales and repayments and the maturities and sales of securities  as well as the ability to use these as collateral for borrowings on a secured basis 
we also maintain excess funds in short term  interest bearing assets that provide additional liquidity 
mortgage loans held for sale totaled million at december   and typically turn over every days as closed loans are sold to investors in the secondary market 
in addition  at december   united held million in excess liquidity  including million in cash equivalent balances  primarily balances in excess of reserve requirements at the federal reserve bank and million in floating rate securities 
the liability section of the balance sheet provides liquidity primarily through interest bearing and noninterest bearing deposit accounts 
federal funds purchased  fhlb advances  brokered deposits  federal reserve short term borrowings and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are additional sources of liquidity and represent united s incremental borrowing capacity 
these sources of liquidity are generally short term in nature are used as necessary to fund asset growth and meet other short term liquidity needs

these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit  letters of credit and financial guarantees 
a commitment to extend credit is an agreement to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
letters of credit and financial guarantees are conditional commitments issued to guarantee a customer s performance to a third party and have essentially the same credit risk as extending loan facilities to customers 
those commitments are primarily issued to local businesses 
the exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the commitments to extend credit  letters of credit and financial guarantees is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments 
united uses the same credit underwriting procedures for making commitments  letters of credit and financial guarantees  as for underwriting on balance sheet instruments 
united evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis and the amount of the collateral  if deemed necessary  is based on the credit evaluation 
collateral held varies  but may include unimproved and improved real estate  certificates of deposit  personal property or other acceptable collateral 
all of these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
the total amount of these instruments does not necessarily represent future cash requirements because a significant portion of these instruments expire without being used 

table of contents united is not involved in off balance sheet contractual relationships  other than those disclosed in this report  that could result in liquidity needs or other commitments  or that could significantly affect earnings 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on off balance sheet arrangements 
at december   united had million in offsetting repurchase agreements reverse repurchase agreements that were netted in the consolidated balance sheet 
united enters into these collateral swap arrangements from time to time as a source of additional revenue 
capital resources and dividends shareholders equity at december  was million  an increase of million from december  accumulated other comprehensive income  which includes unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale and the unrealized gains and losses on derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges  is excluded in the calculation of regulatory capital adequacy ratios 
excluding the change in the accumulated other comprehensive income  shareholders equity increased million  or  from december  during the first quarter of  united closed the private placement 
pursuant to the private placement  the investors purchased and united issued million of the company s existing common stock  consisting of  shares  for per share and issued million in preferred stock consisting of million of series f preferred stock  and million of series g preferred stock 
under the terms of the private placement agreement and following receipt of required shareholder approvals  which were received on june  at united s annual shareholders meeting  the series f preferred stock converted into  shares of voting common stock and the series g preferred stock converted into  shares of non voting common stock 
following such conversion  the investors owned an aggregate of  shares of common stock and  shares of non voting common stock 
the private placement resulted in an increase to shareholders equity of million  net of transaction costs 
on february   united entered into the share exchange agreement with the elm ridge parties 
under the share exchange agreement  the elm ridge parties agreed to transfer to the company  shares of the company s common stock in exchange for  series d preferred shares and warrants to purchase  common shares 
united accrued million in dividends  including accretion of discounts  on series a  series b and series d preferred stock in united accrued million in dividends  including discount accretion  on series a and series b preferred stock  for the year ended december  during the second quarter of  united recorded a million increase to capital surplus as the result of the issuance of equity instruments to fletcher international in conjunction with the sale of nonperforming assets 
in november  united entered into an informal memorandum of understanding with the federal reserve bank of atlanta and the georgia department of banking and finance that superseded the board resolution previously requested by the federal reserve 
the holding company mou provides  similar to the superseded resolution  that united may not incur additional indebtedness  pay cash dividends  make payments on our trust preferred securities or subordinated indebtedness or repurchase outstanding stock without prior approval of the federal reserve 
we were not given permission to pay interest on our trust preferred securities and dividends on our preferred stock during the first quarter of effective april   united received approval to make payments for currently payable and previously deferred dividends and interest on its preferred stock and trust preferred securities 
since then  united has continued to receive quarterly approvals of all payments 
additionally  the holding company mou requires  among other things  that united ensures that the bank functions in a safe and sound manner 
united believes it is in compliance with all requirements of the holding company mou 
the bank is currently subject to an informal memorandum of understanding with the federal deposit insurance corporation and the georgia department of banking and finance 
the bank mou requires  among other things  that the bank maintain its tier leverage ratio at not less than and its total risk based capital ratio at not less than during the life of the bank mou 
additionally  the bank mou requires  among other things  that prior to declaring or paying any cash dividends to united  the bank must obtain the written consent of its regulators 
the bank believes it is in compliance with all requirements of the bank mou 
the board of governors of the federal reserve has issued guidelines for the implementation of risk based capital requirements by us banks and bank holding companies 
these risk based capital guidelines take into consideration risk factors  as defined by regulators  associated with various categories of assets  both on and off balance sheet 
under the guidelines  capital strength is measured in two tiers which are used in conjunction with risk weighted assets to determine the risk based capital ratios 
the guidelines require an total risk based capital ratio  of which must be tier capital 
however  to be considered well capitalized under the guidelines  a total risk based capital ratio is required  of which must be tier capital 
under the risk based capital guidelines  assets and credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and off balance sheet items are assigned to one of several broad risk categories according to the obligor  or  if relevant  the guarantor or the nature of the collateral 
the aggregate dollar amount in each risk category is then multiplied by the risk weight associated with the category 
the resulting weighted values from each of the risk categories are added together  and generally this sum is the company s total risk weighted assets 
risk weighted assets for purposes of united s capital ratios are calculated under these guidelines 

table of contents tier capital consists of shareholders equity  excluding accumulated other comprehensive income  intangible assets goodwill and deposit based intangibles  and disallowed deferred tax assets  plus qualifying capital securities 
united s tier capital totaled million at december  tier capital components include supplemental capital such as the qualifying portion of the allowance for loan losses and qualifying subordinated debt 
tier capital plus tier capital is referred to as total risk based capital and was million at december  the ratios  as calculated under the guidelines  were and for tier and total risk based capital  respectively  at december  a minimum leverage ratio is required in addition to the risk based capital standards and is defined as tier capital divided by average assets adjusted for goodwill and deposit based intangibles 
although a minimum leverage ratio of is required  the federal reserve board requires a bank holding company to maintain a leverage ratio of greater than if it is experiencing or anticipating significant growth or is operating with less than well diversified risks in the opinion of the federal reserve board 
the federal reserve board uses the leverage and risk based capital ratios to assess capital adequacy of banks and bank holding companies 
on december   united participated in treasury s cpp by selling  shares of series b preferred stock and a warrant to purchase  shares  shares  as adjusted for subsequent stock dividends and a reduction following united s stock offering of united s common stock to treasury 
the proceeds of million were allocated between the series b preferred stock and the warrant based on their relative fair values at the time of the sale 
of the million in proceeds  million was allocated to the series b preferred stock and million was allocated to the warrant 
the discount recorded on the series b preferred stock that resulted from allocating a portion of the proceeds to the warrant is being accreted directly to into retained earnings over a five year period applying a level yield 
the exercise price of the warrant is per share per share  as adjusted for subsequent stock dividends and is exercisable at any time on or before december  the series b preferred stock qualifies as tier capital under risk based capital guidelines and will pay cumulative dividends at a rate of per annum for the first five years and per annum thereafter 
the series b preferred stock may be redeemed after december  at the stated amount of  per share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends

table of contents effect of inflation and changing prices a bank s asset and liability structure is substantially different from that of an industrial firm in that primarily all assets and liabilities of a bank are monetary in nature  with relatively little investment in fixed assets or inventories 
inflation has an important effect on the growth of total assets and the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than nominal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
united s management believes the effect of inflation on financial results depends on united s ability to react to changes in interest rates and  by such reaction  reduce the inflationary effect on performance 
united has an asset liability management program to monitor and manage united s interest rate sensitivity position 
in addition  periodic reviews of banking services and products are conducted to adjust pricing in view of current and expected costs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity management the absolute level and volatility of interest rates can have a significant effect on united s profitability 
the objective of interest rate risk management is to identify and manage the sensitivity of net interest revenue to changing interest rates  in order to achieve united s overall financial goals 
based on economic conditions  asset quality and various other considerations  management establishes tolerance ranges for interest rate sensitivity and manages within these ranges 
united s net interest revenue  and the fair value of its financial instruments  are influenced by changes in the level of interest rates 
united manages its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through policies established by the alco 
alco meets monthly and has responsibility for approving asset liability management policies  formulating and implementing strategies to improve balance sheet positioning and or earnings and reviewing united s interest rate sensitivity 
one of the tools management uses to estimate the sensitivity of net interest revenue to changes in interest rates is an asset liability simulation model 
resulting estimates are based upon a number of assumptions for each scenario  including the level of balance sheet growth  loan and deposit repricing characteristics and the rate of prepayments 
alco regularly reviews the assumptions for accuracy based on historical data and future expectations  however  actual net interest revenue may differ from model results 
the primary objective of the simulation model is to measure the potential change in net interest revenue over time using multiple interest rate scenarios 
the base scenario assumes rates remain flat and is the scenario to which all others are compared to in order to measure the change in net interest revenue 
policy limits are based on gradually rising and falling rate scenarios  which are compared to this base scenario 
another commonly analyzed scenario is a most likely scenario that projects the most likely change in rates based on the slope of the yield curve 
other scenarios analyzed may include rate shocks  narrowing or widening spreads  and yield curve steepening or flattening 
while policy scenarios focus on a twelve month time frame  longer time horizons are also modeled 
united s policy is based on the month impact on net interest revenue of interest rate ramps that increase basis points and decrease basis points from the base scenario 
in the ramp scenarios  rates change basis points per month over the initial eight months 
the policy limits the change in net interest revenue over the next months to a decrease in either scenario 
the policy ramp and base scenarios assume a static balance sheet 
historically low rates on december  and made use of the down basis point scenario problematic 
at december  united s simulation model indicated that a basis point increase in rates would cause an approximate 
increase in net interest revenue over the next twelve months and a basis point decrease in rates would cause an approximate 
decrease in net interest revenue over the next twelve months 
at december   united s simulation model indicated that a basis point increase in rates over the next twelve months would cause an approximate 
increase in net interest revenue and a basis point decrease in rates over the next twelve months would cause an approximate 
increase in net interest revenue 
interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of the portfolio of assets and liabilities 
these repricing characteristics are the time frames within which the interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are subject to change in interest rates either at replacement  repricing or maturity during the life of the instruments 
interest rate sensitivity management focuses on the maturity structure of assets and liabilities and their repricing characteristics during periods of changes in market interest rates 
effective interest rate sensitivity management seeks to ensure that both assets and liabilities respond to changes in interest rates within an acceptable timeframe  thereby minimizing the effect of interest rate changes on net interest revenue 
united may have some discretion in the extent and timing of deposit repricing depending upon the competitive pressures in the markets in which it operates 
changes in the mix of earning assets or supporting liabilities can either increase or decrease the net interest margin without affecting interest rate sensitivity 
the interest rate spread between an asset and its supporting liability can vary significantly even when the timing of repricing for both the asset and the liability remains the same  due to the two instruments repricing according to different indices 

table of contents varying interest rate environments can create unexpected changes in prepayment levels of assets and liabilities that are not reflected in an interest rate sensitivity gap analysis 
these prepayments may have significant effect on the net interest margin 
because of these limitations  an interest sensitivity gap analysis alone generally does not provide an accurate assessment of exposure to changes in interest rates 
in order to manage its interest rate sensitivity  united periodically enters into off balance sheet contracts that are considered derivative financial instruments 
derivative financial instruments can be a cost effective and capital effective means of modifying the repricing characteristics of on balance sheet assets and liabilities 
these contracts generally consist of interest rate swaps under which united pays a variable rate and receives a fixed rate and interest rate floor contracts where united pays a premium up front to a counterparty to the right to be compensated if a specified rate index falls below a pre determined floor rate 
united s derivative financial instruments are classified as either cash flow or fair value hedges 
the change in fair value of cash flow hedges is recognized in other comprehensive income 
fair value hedges recognize currently in earnings both the effect of the change in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument and the offsetting effect of the change in fair value of the hedged asset or liability associated with the particular risk of that asset or liability being hedged 
the following table presents united s outstanding derivative positions at december  table derivative financial instruments as of december  dollars in thousands september  september  september  september  type maturity notional amount rate received floor rate rate paid fair value fair value hedges libor swaps brokered cds november  receive rate is fixed at to november   then year constant maturity swap rate year constant maturity swap rate basis points  capped at and floored at 
pay rate is day libor minus basis points which results in a negative pay rate when day libor falls below basis points 
swap is callable on november  and quarterly thereafter on the th with calendar days notice 
from time to time  united will terminate swap or floor positions when conditions change and the position is no longer necessary to manage united s overall sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
in those situations where the terminated swap or floor was in an effective hedging relationship at the time of termination and the hedging relationship is expected to remain effective throughout the original term of the swap or floor  the resulting gain or loss is amortized over the remaining life of the original contract 
for swap contracts  the gain or loss is amortized over the remaining original contract term using the straight line method of amortization 
for floor contracts  the gain or loss is amortized over the remaining original contract term based on the original floorlet schedule 
at december   united had million in gains from terminated derivative positions included in other comprehensive income that will be amortized into earnings over their remaining original contract terms 
approximately million is expected to be reclassified into interest revenue over the next twelve months 
united s policy requires all derivative financial instruments be used only for asset liability management through the hedging of specific transactions or positions  and not for trading or speculative purposes 
management believes that the risk associated with using derivative financial instruments to mitigate interest rate risk sensitivity is minimal and should not have any material unintended effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in order to mitigate potential credit risk  from time to time united may require the counterparties to derivative contracts to pledge securities as collateral to cover the net exposure
