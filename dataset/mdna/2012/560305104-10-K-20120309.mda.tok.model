trends in our business we operate in two segments  wholesale and retail 
our wholesale segment includes both our domestic and international wholesale markets 
our retail segment includes our company operated outlet stores and our websites 
we have identified near term opportunities for growth and operational improvements  as well as challenges  including general macro economic conditions that may affect our customers and our business 
in particular  management believes that there are many factors influencing the intimate apparel industry  including but not limited to consistent demand for foundation garments  consumer demand for innovative and leading brands  sourcing and supply chain efficiencies  continued growth of the mass merchant channel  pressure from i maidenform brands  inc item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued retailers brought about by the consolidation in the retail industry  increases in the cost of the raw materials used in intimate apparel products and uncertainty surrounding import restrictions 
we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on or address these trends by  among other things continuing to launch innovative products and new brands  increasing our presence in department stores and national chain stores through the use of maidenform  control it  flexees  lilyette  luleh and maidenform s charmed brands  expanding distribution of our donna karan and dkny licensed brands  expanding shapewear awareness  increasing our presence in the mass merchant channel through the use of bodymates  inspirations  self expressions and sweet nothings brands  expanding our international presence  increasing consumer identification with our brands through further marketing investments  marketing  rather than manufacturing our brands  making selective acquisitions  entering into license agreements  and developing and marketing new products that will complement our existing products or distribution channels  and merchandising  marketing and selling private brand products to selected retailers 
wholesale segment department stores and national chain stores 
the department stores and national chain stores are where we generally sell the maidenform  control it  flexees  lilyette  luleh and maidenform s charmed brands 
we plan to continue to invest in increasing our net sales with department store and national chain store customers  which we believe is important to our long term positioning in the channel 
while we have grown our sales meaningfully in the past several years with department stores and national chain stores  we expect the rate of our future net sales growth to be moderate 
we have customers located outside the united states that purchase our maidenform  control it  flexees  lilyette  luleh and maidenform s charmed brands 
the majority of these net sales are included in the department stores and national chain stores channel 
we also sell the donna karan and dkny brands in this channel  domestically and internationally  as a result of our license agreement 
this agreement grants us the rights to design  source and market a full collection of donna karan and dkny women s intimate apparel products 
mass merchants 
the mass merchant channel includes both mass merchants and warehouse clubs 
we intend to improve our penetration with mass merchants through the use of our brands bodymates  inspirations  self expressions and sweet nothings brands 
we have experienced meaningful growth in this channel over the past several years and expect to continue to achieve modest growth in the future as we are able to increase both the floor space and number of doors in which our products are sold  both domestically and internationally 
we expect that both our net sales to this channel and our net sales to this channel as a percentage of our total net sales are likely to increase over time 
the volume and mix of net sales of our brands in the mass merchant channel can vary from period to period based upon strategic changes that our form k i item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued customers may implement from time to time 
net sales to customers in the mass channel that are located outside the united states are included in this channel 
other 
net sales from this channel include sales to specialty retailers  off price retailers and royalty income from licensees 
we supply private brands to specialty retailers as opportunities present themselves and we continually evaluate this channel for opportunities 
the volume and mix of net sales of private label in the other channel can vary significantly from period to period based upon new product introductions 
we expect net sales growth to decline in this channel in the near future 
net sales to customers in the other channel that are located outside the united states are included in this channel 
we selectively target strategic acquisitions  licensing opportunities or brand start ups to grow our consumer base and would utilize any acquired companies and licenses to complement our current products  channels and geographic scope 
we believe that acquisitions and licenses can enhance our product offerings to retailers and provide growth opportunities 
we believe we can leverage our core competencies such as product development  brand management  logistics and marketing to create significant value from the acquired businesses and licenses as we did with the intimate apparel license agreement for the donna karan and dkny brands 
we also generate net sales from licensing our brand names to qualified partners for natural line extensions in the intimate apparel market such as girls bras  swimwear and bra accessories 
licensing royalties account for less than of our total net sales 
our licensed products are sold at department stores  at national chains and mass merchants  at our company operated outlet stores and through our websites 
we believe that we can potentially expand our licensing activities beyond our current offerings 
retail segment we believe our retail sales volume is driven by our ability to service our existing consumers and obtain new consumers  as well as overall general macro economic conditions that can affect our consumers and ultimately their levels of overall spending and choice of retail channel for their purchases 
additionally  identifying optimal retail outlet locations  favorable leasing arrangements  and improving our store productivity are factors important to growing our retail segment s net sales 
we also sell our products through our websites  www 
maidenform 
com and www 
maidenform 
co 
uk 
although we currently do not generate a significant amount of net sales through these sites  we do expect it to continue to grow 
our objectives in our retail segment are to continue to increase the productivity of our portfolio of stores through effective merchandising and focused advertising  as well as selectively closing less productive locations and potentially opening new stores in more productive locations 
even in those situations where we selectively close less productive outlet stores and do not open a new store in that region  we believe those consumers still purchase many of our maidenform brands from our other outlet stores  our websites or our wholesale segment customers that carry these brands 
our company operated outlet stores reduce our dependence on off price retailers and increase brand awareness through direct to consumer sale of our products 
i maidenform brands  inc item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued definitions in reviewing our operating performance  we evaluate both the wholesale and retail segments by focusing on each segment s operating income  cash flows from operations and inventory turns 
net sales 
our net sales are derived from two operating segments  wholesale and retail 
net sales from the wholesale segment are recognized when the customer takes possession and are recorded net of cooperative advertising allowances  sales returns  sales discounts  and markdown allowances provided to our customers 
net sales in our retail segment are recognized at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise at the point of sale in our stores  and for our internet sales  when the products are shipped and title passes to the customer 
cost of sales 
we outsource all manufacturing of the products we sell and  therefore  the principal elements of our cost of sales are for finished goods inventories purchased from our sourced vendors 
included in cost of sales and affecting our overall gross margins are freight expenses from the manufacturers to our distribution centers in situations where such expenses are charged separately 
also included in cost of sales is the cost of warehousing  labor and overhead related to receiving and warehousing at our distribution centers  and depreciation of assets related to our receiving and warehousing in our distribution centers 
direct labor  cost of fabrics  as well as raw materials for fabrics  are the primary components driving the overall cost of our sourced finished goods inventories from our sourcing vendors 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a 
our sg a includes all of our marketing  product development  selling  distribution and general and administrative expenses for both the wholesale and retail segments which include our retail outlet store payroll and related benefits 
general and administrative expenses include management payroll  benefits  travel  information systems  accounting  distribution  rent  insurance and legal costs 
additionally  depreciation related to the shipping function in our distribution centers and our corporate office assets such as furniture  fixtures  equipment and technology  as well as amortization of intellectual property  are included in sg a 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes using the liability method  which recognizes the amount of income tax payable or refundable for the current year and recognizes deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of the events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns 
for those uncertain tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  a tax benefit has been recorded 
for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit has been recognized 
where applicable  associated interest and penalties are recorded 
we routinely evaluate all deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of their realization and record a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
for more information  see the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
net operating loss nols carryforwards enable a company to apply nols incurred during a current period against a future period s profits in order to reduce cash tax liabilities in those future periods 
in periods when a company is generating operating losses  its nols will increase 
the tax effect of the nols is recorded as a deferred tax asset 
if the company does not believe that it is more likely than not that it will be able to utilize the nols  it records a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset 
additionally  section of the form k i item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued internal revenue code section imposes limitations on a corporation s ability to utilize its nols if it experiences an ownership change 
in general terms  an ownership change results from transactions increasing the ownership of certain existing stockholders and  or  new stockholders in the stock of a corporation by more than percentage points during a three year testing period 
any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years  and the amount of the limitation may  under certain circumstances  be increased to reflect both recognized and deemed recognized built in gains that occur during the sixty month period after the ownership change 
our nols are subject to section limitations 
at december   we had approximately million of federal and state nols available for utilization in the years from through results of operations included in this presentation are discussions and reconciliations of sg a  operating income and net income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap to sg a  operating income and net income excluding a litigation settlement  costs associated with a discontinuation of a product line and severance expense 
each of these adjustments was selected because our management uses these non gaap measures in discussing and analyzing our results of operations and because we believe the non gaap measures provide investors with greater transparency by helping to illustrate the underlying financial and business trends relating to our results of operations  financial condition and comparability between current and prior periods

contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet arrangements we have various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
other items  such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts  are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed 
for example  we are contractually committed to make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december  and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash 
in addition  the table reflects the timing of principal payments on outstanding borrowings

we also have pension and postretirement benefit obligations included in other non current liabilities  as further described in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and pension and postretirement benefit obligations have not been included in the schedule of cash contractual obligations above because we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments of these liabilities 
we expect to contribute approximately million to our pension and postretirement plans during off balance sheet arrangements 
our most significant off balance sheet financing arrangements as of december  are non cancelable operating lease agreements  primarily for our company operated outlet stores  our corporate headquarters and our leased distribution centers located in shannon  ireland and fayetteville  north carolina 
we do not participate in any off balance sheet arrangements involving unconsolidated subsidiaries that provide financing or potentially expose us to unrecorded financial obligations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in our notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies  which are those that require our most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
form k i management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued accounts receivable 
accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due from customers 
we provide reserves for accounts receivable that may not be realized as a result of uncollectibility  sales returns  markdowns  and other customer allowances 
reserves are determined based on historical experience  credit quality  age of accounts receivable balances  and economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
we believe that our reserves provide reasonable assurance that such balances are reflected at net realizable value 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
the cost of wholesale inventory is based on standard costs  which approximate first in  first out fifo  while the cost of product acquired from third parties for sale through our retail segment is based on the retail inventory method 
we provide reserves for slow moving inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we project  additional reserves may be required 
goodwill and intangible assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are evaluated by us for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances exist 
we evaluated goodwill and intangible assets during the fourth quarter of and determined that no impairment exists and no reporting unit was at risk 
we had zero cumulative impairment losses for and we allocate our goodwill to our reporting units 
in evaluating goodwill for impairment  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount 
if the fair value is less than the carrying amount  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying amount 
to determine the fair values  we use both a discounted cash flow approach and a market approach 
in reviewing intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment  we compare the carrying amount of such asset to its fair value 
we estimate the fair value using discounted cash flows expected from the use of the asset 
when the estimated fair value is less than its carrying amount  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the asset s fair value and its carrying amount 
in addition  intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events such as product discontinuance or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the performance of the goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests are subject to significant judgment in determining the estimation of future cash flows  discount rates  and other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair value and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
impairment of long lived assets 
long lived assets  primarily property and equipment  and intangible assets with finite lives  are periodically reviewed and evaluated by us when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
for long lived assets  this evaluation is based on the expected future undiscounted operating cash flows of the related assets 
should such evaluation result in us concluding that the carrying amount of long lived assets has been impaired  an appropriate write down to their fair value would be recorded 
at december  and january  we had million of cumulative impairment losses 
included in amortization expense is million related to the impairment of an intangible asset  which we determined had no future benefit

net sales from the wholesale segment are recognized when the customer takes possession  at which time title and the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer and persuasive evidence of a sale arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and payment is reasonably assured 
in the case of sales by our retail operations  net sales are recognized at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise at the point of sale in our stores  and for our internet sales  when the products are received by the customer 
reserves for sales returns  markdown allowances  cooperative advertising  discounts and other customer deductions are provided when sales are recorded or when the commitment is incurred 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes using the liability method which recognizes the amount of income tax payable or refundable for the current year and recognizes deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of the events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns 
for those uncertain tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  a tax benefit has been recorded 
for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit has been recognized 
where applicable  associated interest and penalties are recorded 
we routinely evaluate all deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of their realization and record a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
this assessment requires us to consider all available positive and negative evidence to determine whether  based on such evidence  it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets will be realized in future periods 
accrued expenses 
accrued expenses for health insurance  workers compensation insurance  incentive compensation  professional fees  and other outstanding obligations are based on actual commitments 
these estimates are updated periodically as additional information becomes available 
pension plan 
the long term rate of return for our pension plan is established via a building block approach with proper consideration of diversification and rebalancing 
historical markets are studied and long term historical relationships between equity and fixed income securities are preserved consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run 
current market factors  such as inflation and interest rates  are evaluated before long term capital market assumptions are determined 
we employ a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the long term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk 
risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities  plan funded status and corporate financial condition 
the assets of our pension plan are held in pooled separate accounts and are invested in mutual funds consisting of a diversified blend of equity and fixed income securities 
we use this investment approach in order to meet its diversification and asset allocation goals 
furthermore  equity investments are diversified across domestic and foreign stocks  as well as growth  value  and small and large capitalizations 
investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews  annual liability measurements and periodic asset liability studies 
we expect to contribute approximately million to our pension plan in at december   we used a discount rate assumption of based upon the index fund that closely matches our expected pension benefit payouts 
at december   we used a long term rate of return assumption of based on the investment return of our pension plan assets  which are primarily in equity securities

recently issued accounting standards in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance related to testing goodwill for impairment 
the guidance permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
if it is concluded that this is the case  it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test prescribed under current accounting rules 
otherwise  the two step goodwill impairment test is not required 
we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income 
this guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity 
the guidance allows two presentation alternatives present items of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement  referred to as the statement of comprehensive income  or in two separate  but consecutive  statements of net income and other comprehensive income 
in december  the fasb issued guidance to defer the effective date of the specific requirement to present items that are reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive to net income alongside their respective components of net income and other comprehensive income 
all other provisions of this update  which are to be applied retrospectively  are effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  early adoption is permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk 
we do not believe that we have significant foreign currency transactional exposures 
our net sales for the years ended  and in currencies other than us dollars were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
during and  our net sales were favorably impacted by million and million  respectively  due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
during  our net sales were unfavorably impacted by million due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
most of our purchases are denominated in us dollars 
the impact of a unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the prevailing market rates of the foreign currencies in which we have transactional exposures would be immaterial 
interest rate risk 
from time to time  we manage our interest rate risk through the use of interest rate swaps 
our last swap contract matured on december  at december   our debt portfolio was comprised of variable rate debt  with no portion hedged 
we estimate that a change in interest rates would have had a million impact on our interest expense for and  respectively  and a million impact on our interest expense for commodity price risk 
we are subject primarily to commodity price risk arising from fluctuations in the market prices of raw materials used in the garments purchased from our sourcing vendors if they pass along these increased costs 
during the past five years  there has been no significant impact from commodity price fluctuations  nor do we currently use derivative instruments in the management of these risks 
on a going forward basis  fluctuations in crude oil prices or petroleum based product prices may also influence the prices of the related items such as chemicals  dyestuffs  man made fibers and foam  and transportation costs 
any raw material price increase would increase our cost of sales and decrease our profitability unless we are able to pass our higher costs on to our customers 
inflation risk 
we are affected by inflation and changing prices from our suppliers primarily through the cost of raw materials  increased operating costs and expenses  and fluctuations in interest rates 
the effects of inflation on our net sales and operations have not been material in recent years 
we do not believe that inflation risk is material to our business or our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in the future  volatile crude oil and gasoline prices may impact our product and freight costs  consumer confidence and disposable income 
seasonality 
we have not experienced any significant seasonal fluctuations in our net sales or our profitability
