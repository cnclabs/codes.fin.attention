recent developments and significant events regulatory actions on march   banner bank entered into a memorandum of understanding bank mou with the fdic and washington dfi 
the company also entered into a similar mou with the federal reserve bank of san francisco federal reserve bank on march  frb mou 
under the bank mou  banner bank is required  among other things  to develop and implement plans to reduce commercial real estate concentrations  to improve asset quality and reduce classified assets  to improve profitability  and to increase tier leverage capital to equal or exceed of average assets 
in addition  banner bank is not permitted to pay cash dividends to banner corporation without prior approval from the fdic and dfi and the company and banner bank must obtain prior regulatory approval before adding any new director or senior executive officer or changing the responsibilities of any current senior executive officer 
further  the company may not pay any dividends on common or preferred stock  pay interest or principal on the balance of its junior subordinated debentures or repurchase its common stock without the prior written non objection of the federal reserve bank 
for additional information  see item a  risk factors risks associated with our business we are required to comply with the terms of memoranda of understanding that we have entered into with the fdic and dfi and the federal reserve bank and lack of compliance could result in additional regulatory actions 
income tax reporting and accounting amended federal income tax returns on october   the company filed amended federal income tax returns for tax years   and the amended tax returns  which are expected to be reviewed by the internal revenue service irs  would significantly affect the timing for recognition of credit losses within previously filed income tax returns and  if approved  would result in the refund of up to million of previously paid taxes from the utilization of net operating loss carryback claims into prior tax years 
the outcome of the anticipated irs review is inherently uncertain and since there can be no assurance of approval of some or all of the tax carryback claims  no asset has been recognized to reflect the possible results of these amendments as of december   because of this uncertainty 
accordingly  we do not anticipate recognizing any tax benefit until the results of the irs review have been determined 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance the company and the banks file consolidated us federal income tax returns  as well as state income tax returns in oregon and idaho 
income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method 
under this method a deferred tax asset or liability is determined based on the enacted tax rates which are expected to be in effect when the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax basis of existing assets and liabilities are expected to be reported in the company s income tax returns 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
under us generally acceptable accounting principles gaap  a valuation allowance is required to be recognized if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
while realization of the deferred tax asset is ultimately dependent on a return to sustained profitability  which management believes is more likely than not  the guidance reflected in the accounting standard is significantly influenced by consideration of recent historical operating results 
during the third quarter of  we evaluated our net deferred tax asset and determined it was prudent to establish a valuation allowance against the entire asset 
this action caused our income tax expense to be million for that period 
as a result  we recorded million income tax expense for the year ended december  no tax benefit or expense was recognized during see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information

t he additional capital enhances the company s capacity to support the communities it serves through expanded lending activities and economic development 
this capital also adds flexibility in considering strategic opportunities that may be available to it 
lending activities general all of our lending activities are conducted through banner bank  its subsidiary  community financial corporation  and islanders bank 
we offer a wide range of loan products to meet the demands of our customers and our loan portfolio is very diversified by product type  borrower and geographic location within our market area 
we originate loans for our own loan portfolio and for sale in the secondary market 
management s strategy has been to maintain a well diversified portfolio with a significant percentage of assets in the loan portfolio having more frequent interest rate repricing terms or shorter maturities than traditional long term fixed rate mortgage loans 
as part of this effort  we have developed a variety of floating or adjustable interest rate products that correlate more closely with our cost of funds  particularly loans for commercial business and real estate  agricultural business  and construction and development purposes 
however  in response to customer demand  we continue to originate fixed rate loans  including fixed interest rate mortgage loans with terms of up to years 
the relative amount of fixed rate loans and adjustable rate loans that can be originated at any time is largely determined by the demand for each in a competitive environment 
historically  our lending activities have been primarily directed toward the origination of real estate and commercial loans 
until recent periods  real estate lending activities were significantly focused on residential construction and land development loans and first mortgages on owner occupied  one to four family residential properties  however  over the past four years our origination of construction and land development loans has declined substantially and the proportion of the portfolio invested in these types of loans has materially declined 
our residential mortgage loan originations also decreased during this four year cycle  although less significantly than the decline in construction and land development lending  as exceptionally low interest rates supported demand for loans to refinance existing debt as well as loans to finance home purchases 
despite modest demand  our residential mortgage loan portfolio has increased in amount and as a proportion of our total loan portfolio during this cycle  although residential mortgage loan balances have declined for each of the past two years 
our real estate lending activities have also included the origination of multifamily and commercial real estate loans 
our commercial business lending has been directed toward meeting the credit and related deposit needs of various small to medium sized business and agri business borrowers operating in our primary market areas 
reflecting the weak economy  in recent periods demand for these types of commercial business loans has been modest and total outstanding balances have declined from peak balances at june   however  originations of commercial business loans were substantially higher in than in the previous three years 
our consumer loan activity is primarily directed at meeting demand from our existing deposit customers and  while we have increased our emphasis on consumer lending in recent years  demand for consumer loans also has been modest during this period of economic weakness as many consumers have been focused on reducing their personal debt 
while continuing our commitment to residential lending  including our mortgage banking activities  we expect commercial lending including owner occupied commercial real estate  commercial business and agricultural loans and consumer lending to become increasingly more important activities for us 
by contrast  we anticipate residential construction and related land development lending  which at december  represented of the loan portfolio  compared to a year earlier and more than at its peak during the second quarter of  will continue to be restrained by market conditions for the foreseeable future  as well as by our efforts to manage our concentration in this type of lending 
at december   our net loan portfolio totaled billion 
for additional information concerning our loan portfolio  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition comparison of financial condition at december  and loans and lending 
see also tables and contained therein  which sets forth the composition and geographic concentration of our loan portfolio  and tables and  which contain information regarding the loans maturing in our portfolio 
one to four family residential real estate lending at both banner bank and islanders bank  we originate loans secured by first mortgages on one to four family residences in the northwest communities where we have offices 
while we offer a wide range of products  we have not engaged in any sub prime lending programs  which we define as loans to borrowers with poor credit histories or undocumented repayment capabilities and with excessive reliance on the collateral as the source of repayment 
however  we have experienced a modest increase in delinquencies on our residential loans in response to the weakened housing market conditions 
at december   million  or of our loan portfolio  consisted of permanent loans on one to four family residences 
we offer fixed and adjustable rate mortgages arms at rates and terms competitive with market conditions  primarily with the intent of selling these loans into the secondary market 
fixed rate loans generally are offered on a fully amortizing basis for terms ranging from to years at interest rates and fees that reflect current secondary market pricing 
most arm products offered adjust annually after an initial period ranging from one to five years  subject to a limitation on the annual change of to and a lifetime limitation of to 
for a small portion of the portfolio  where the initial period exceeds one year  the first rate change may exceed the annual limitation on subsequent rate changes 
our arm products most frequently adjust based upon the average yield on us treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year or certain libor indices plus a margin or spread above the index 
arm loans held in our portfolio may allow for interest only payments for an initial period up to five years but do not provide for negative amortization of principal and carry no prepayment restrictions 
the retention of arm loans in our loan portfolio can help reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates 
however  borrower demand for arm loans versus fixed rate mortgage loans is a function of the level of interest rates  the expectations of changes in the level of interest rates and the difference between the initial interest rates and fees charged for each type of loan 
in recent years  borrower demand for arm loans has been limited and we have chosen not to aggressively pursue arm loans by offering minimally profitable  deeply discounted teaser rates or option payment arm products 
as a result  arm loans have represented only a small portion of our loans originated during this period and of our portfolio 
our residential loans are generally underwritten and documented in accordance with the guidelines established by the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac or fhlmc and the federal national mortgage association fannie mae or fnma 
government insured loans are underwritten and documented in accordance with the guidelines established by the department of housing and urban development hud and the veterans administration va 
in the loan approval process  we assess the borrower s ability to repay the loan  the adequacy of the proposed security  the employment stability of the borrower and the creditworthiness of the borrower 
for arm loans  our standard practice provides for underwriting based upon fully indexed interest rates and payments 
generally  we will lend up to of the lesser of the appraised value or purchase price of the property on conventional loans  although higher loan to value ratios are available on certain government insured programs 
we require private mortgage insurance on conventional residential loans with a loan to value ratio at origination exceeding 
for the past three years  particularly in and  a number of exceptions to these general underwriting guidelines were granted in connection with the sale or refinance of properties  particularly new construction  for which we were already providing financing 
these exceptions most commonly relate to loan to value and mortgage insurance requirements and not to credit underwriting or loan documentation standards 
such exceptions  while less frequent in recent periods  will likely continue in the near term to facilitate troubled loan resolution in the current distressed housing market  and may result in loans having performance characteristics different from the rest of our one to four family loan portfolio 
through our mortgage banking activities  we sell residential loans on either a servicing retained or servicing released basis 
during the past three years  we have sold a significant portion of our conventional residential mortgage originations and nearly all of our government insured loans in the secondary market 
construction and land lending historically  we have invested a significant portion of our loan portfolio in residential construction and land loans to professional home builders and developers  however  the amount of this investment has been substantially reduced in recent years 
to a lesser extent  we also originate construction loans for commercial and multifamily real estate 
in years prior to  residential construction and land development lending was an area of major emphasis at banner bank and the primary focus of its subsidiary  cfc 
our largest concentrations of construction and land development loans are in the greater puget sound region of washington state and the portland  oregon market area 
we also have construction and land loans for properties to a much smaller extent in the greater boise  idaho area and certain eastern washington and eastern oregon markets 
at december   construction and land loans totaled million  or of total loans of the company  consisting of million of one to four family construction loans  million of residential land or land development loans  million of commercial and multifamily real estate construction loans and million of commercial land or land development loans 
construction and land lending affords us the opportunity to achieve higher interest rates and fees with shorter terms to maturity than are usually available on other types of lending 
construction and land lending  however  involves a higher degree of risk than other lending opportunities because of the inherent difficulty in estimating both a property s value at completion of the project and the estimated cost of the project 
if the estimate of construction cost proves to be inaccurate  we may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the project 
if the estimate of value upon completion proves to be inaccurate  we may be confronted at  or prior to  the maturity of the loan with a project the value of which is insufficient to assure full repayment 
disagreements between borrowers and builders and the failure of builders to pay subcontractors may also jeopardize projects 
loans to builders to construct homes for which no purchaser has been identified carry additional risk because the payoff for the loan is dependent on the builder s ability to sell the property before the construction loan is due 
we attempt to address these risks by adhering to strict underwriting policies  disbursement procedures and monitoring practices 
construction loans made by us include those with a sales contract or permanent loan in place for the finished homes and those for which purchasers for the finished homes may be identified either during or following the construction period 
we actively monitor the number of unsold homes in our construction loan portfolio and local housing markets to attempt to maintain an appropriate balance between home sales and new loan originations 
the maximum number of speculative loans loans that are not presold approved for each builder is based on a combination of factors  including the financial capacity of the builder  the market demand for the finished product and the ratio of sold to unsold inventory the builder maintains 
we have attempted to diversify the risk associated with speculative construction lending by doing business with a large number of small and mid sized builders spread over a relatively large geographic region with numerous sub markets within our three state service area 
loans for the construction of one to four family residences are generally made for a term of twelve to eighteen months 
our loan policies include maximum loan to value ratios of up to for speculative loans 
individual speculative loan requests are supported by an independent appraisal of the property  a set of plans  a cost breakdown and a completed specifications form 
underwriting is focused on the borrowers financial strength  credit history and demonstrated ability to produce a quality product and effectively market and manage their operations 
all speculative construction loans must be approved by senior loan officers 
historically  we have also made land loans to developers  builders and individuals to finance the acquisition and or development of improved lots or unimproved land  although over the past four years we generally have not originated this type of loan 
in making land loans  we follow underwriting policies and disbursement and monitoring procedures similar to those for construction loans 
the initial term on land loans is typically one to three years with interest only payments  payable monthly  and provisions for principal reduction as lots are sold and released from the lien of the mortgage 
we regularly monitor the construction and land loan portfolios and the economic conditions and housing inventory in each of our markets and decrease this type of lending if we perceive unfavorable market conditions such as the existing economic environment 
housing markets in most areas of the pacific northwest significantly deteriorated beginning in and our origination of new construction loans declined sharply as a result 
we believe that the underwriting policies and internal monitoring systems we have in place have helped to mitigate some of the risks inherent in construction and land lending  however  weak housing market conditions nonetheless resulted in material delinquencies and charge offs in our construction and land loan portfolios in recent years 
while construction and land loans  including residential  commercial and multifamily  have been meaningfully reduced  they still represent of our portfolio and are responsible for approximately of our non performing loans 
although well diversified with respect to sub markets  price ranges and borrowers  our construction and land loans are significantly concentrated in the greater puget sound region of washington state and the portland  oregon market area 
reducing the amount of non performing construction and land development loans and related real estate acquired through foreclosure has been the most critical issue that we have needed to resolve to return to acceptable levels of profitability and we have made substantial progress during the past two years in this regard 
the most significant risk in this portfolio relates to the land development loans as demand for building lots is currently weak 
see asset quality below and item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations asset quality 
commercial and multifamily real estate lending we originate loans secured by multifamily and commercial real estate including  as noted above  loans for construction of multifamily and commercial real estate projects 
commercial real estate loans are made for both owner occupied and investor properties 
at december   our loan portfolio included million in multifamily and billion in commercial real estate loans  including million in owner occupied commercial real estate loans and million in non owner occupied commercial real estate loans  which in aggregate comprised of our total loans 
multifamily and commercial real estate lending affords us an opportunity to receive interest at rates higher than those generally available from one to four family residential lending 
however  loans secured by multifamily and commercial properties are generally greater in amount  more difficult to evaluate and monitor and  therefore  potentially riskier than one to four family residential mortgage loans 
because payments on loans secured by multifamily and commercial properties are often dependent on the successful operation and management of the properties  repayment of these loans may be affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy 
in originating multifamily and commercial real estate loans  we consider the location  marketability and overall attractiveness of the properties 
our underwriting guidelines for multifamily and commercial real estate loans require an appraisal from a qualified independent appraiser and an economic analysis of each property with regard to the annual revenue and expenses  debt service coverage and fair value to determine the maximum loan amount 
in the approval process we assess the borrowers willingness and ability to manage the property and repay the loan and the adequacy of the collateral in relation to the loan amount 
multifamily and commercial real estate loans originated by us are both fixed and adjustable rate loans generally with intermediate terms of five to ten years 
most multifamily and commercial real estate loans originated in the past five years are linked to various federal home loan bank fhlb advance rates  certain prime rates or other market rate indices 
rates on these adjustable rate loans generally adjust with a frequency of one to five years after an initial fixed rate period ranging from one to ten years 
our commercial real estate portfolio consists of loans on a variety of property types with no large concentrations by property type  location or borrower 
at december   the average size of our commercial real estate loans was  and the largest commercial real estate loan in our portfolio was approximately million 
commercial business lending we are active in small to medium sized business lending and are engaged to a lesser extent in agricultural lending primarily by providing crop production loans 
our officers devote a great deal of effort to developing customer relationships and the ability to serve these types of borrowers 
while also strengthening our commitment to small business lending  in recent years we have added experienced officers and staff focused on corporate lending opportunities for borrowers with credit needs generally in a million to million range 
in addition to providing earning assets  this type of lending has helped us increase our deposit base 
expanding commercial lending and related commercial banking services is currently an area of significant focus  including recent reorganization and additions to staffing in the areas of credit administration  small business administration sba lending  business development  and loan and deposit operations 
commercial business loans may entail greater risk than other types of loans 
commercial business loans may be unsecured or secured by special purpose or rapidly depreciating assets  such as equipment  inventory and receivables  which may not provide an adequate source of repayment on defaulted loans 
in addition  commercial business loans are dependent on the borrower s continuing financial strength and management ability  as well as market conditions for various products  services and commodities 
for these reasons  commercial business loans generally provide higher yields or related revenue opportunities than many other types of loans but also require more administrative and management attention 
loan terms  including the fixed or adjustable interest rate  the loan maturity and the collateral considerations  vary significantly and are negotiated on an individual loan basis 
we underwrite our commercial business loans on the basis of the borrower s cash flow and ability to service the debt from earnings rather than on the basis of the underlying collateral value 
we seek to structure these loans so that they have more than one source of repayment 
the borrower is required to provide us with sufficient information to allow us to make a prudent lending determination 
in most instances  this information consists of at least three years of financial statements  tax returns  a statement of projected cash flows  current financial information on any guarantor and information about the collateral 
loans to closely held businesses typically require personal guarantees by the principals 
our commercial loan portfolio is geographically dispersed across the market areas serviced by our branch network and there are no significant concentrations by industry or products 
our commercial business loans may be structured as term loans or as lines of credit 
commercial business term loans are generally made to finance the purchase of fixed assets and have maturities of five years or less 
commercial business lines of credit are typically made for the purpose of providing working capital and are usually approved with a term of one year 
adjustable or floating rate loans are primarily tied to various prime rate or libor indices 
at december   commercial business loans totaled million  or of our total loans 
agricultural lending agriculture is a major industry in many parts of our service areas 
while agricultural loans are not a large part of our portfolio  we intend to continue to make agricultural loans to borrowers with a strong capital base  sufficient management depth  proven ability to operate through agricultural cycles  reliable cash flows and adequate financial reporting 
payments on agricultural loans depend  to a large degree  on the results of operations of the related farm entity 
the repayment is also subject to other economic and weather conditions as well as market prices for agricultural products  which can be highly volatile 
at december   agricultural business loans  including collateral secured loans to purchase farm land and equipment  totaled million  or of our loan portfolio 
agricultural operating loans generally are made as a percentage of the borrower s anticipated income to support budgeted operating expenses 
these loans are secured by a blanket lien on all crops  livestock  equipment  accounts and products and proceeds thereof 
in the case of crops  consideration is given to projected yields and prices from each commodity 
the interest rate is normally floating based on the prime rate or a libor index plus a negotiated margin 
because these loans are made to finance a farm or ranch s annual operations  they are usually written on a one year review and renewable basis 
the renewal is dependent upon the prior year s performance and the forthcoming year s projections as well as the overall financial strength of the borrower 
we carefully monitor these loans and related variance reports on income and expenses compared to budget estimates 
to meet the seasonal operating needs of a farm  borrowers may qualify for single payment notes  revolving lines of credit and or non revolving lines of credit 
in underwriting agricultural operating loans  we consider the cash flow of the borrower based upon the expected operating results as well as the value of collateral used to secure the loans 
collateral generally consists of cash crops produced by the farm  such as milk  grains  fruit  grass seed  peas  sugar beets  mint  onions  potatoes  corn and alfalfa or livestock 
in addition to considering cash flow and obtaining a blanket security interest in the farm s cash crop  we may also collateralize an operating loan with the farm s operating equipment  breeding stock  real estate and federal agricultural program payments to the borrower 
we also originate loans to finance the purchase of farm equipment 
loans to purchase farm equipment are made for terms of up to seven years 
on occasion  we also originate agricultural real estate loans secured primarily by first liens on farmland and improvements thereon located in our market areas  although generally only to service the needs of our existing customers 
loans are written in amounts ranging from to of the tax assessed or appraised value of the property for terms of five to years 
these loans generally have interest rates that adjust at least every five years based upon a us treasury index or fhlb advance rate plus a negotiated margin 
fixed rate loans are granted on terms usually not to exceed five years 
in originating agricultural real estate loans  we consider the debt service coverage of the borrower s cash flow  the appraised value of the underlying property  the experience and knowledge of the borrower  and the borrower s past performance with us and or the market area 
these loans normally are not made to start up businesses and are reserved for existing customers with substantial equity and a proven history 
among the more common risks to agricultural lending can be weather conditions and disease 
these risks may be mitigated through multi peril crop insurance 
commodity prices also present a risk  which may be reduced by the use of set price contracts 
normally  required beginning and projected operating margins provide for reasonable reserves to offset unexpected yield and price deficiencies 
in addition to these risks  we also consider management succession  life insurance and business continuation plans when evaluating agricultural loans 
consumer and other lending we originate a variety of consumer loans  including home equity lines of credit  automobile loans and loans secured by deposit accounts 
while consumer lending has traditionally been a small part of our business  with loans made primarily to accommodate our existing customer base  it has received consistent emphasis in recent years 
part of this emphasis has been the reintroduction of a banner bank funded credit card program which we began marketing in the fourth quarter of similar to other consumer loan programs  we focus this credit card program on our existing customer base to add to the depth of our customer relationships 
our underwriting of consumer loans is focused on the borrower s credit history and ability to repay the debt as evidenced by documented sources of income 
at december   we had million  or of our loans receivable  in consumer related loans 
similar to commercial business loans  consumer loans often entail greater risk than residential mortgage loans  particularly in the case of consumer loans which are unsecured or secured by rapidly depreciating assets such as automobiles 
in such cases  any repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance as a result of the greater likelihood of damage  loss or depreciation 
the remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower 
in addition  consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower s continuing financial stability  and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss  divorce  illness or personal bankruptcy 
furthermore  the application of various federal and state laws  including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws  may limit the amount which can be recovered on such loans 
these loans may also give rise to claims and defenses by a consumer loan borrower against an assignee of such loans such as us  and a borrower may be able to assert against the assignee claims and defenses that it has against the seller of the underlying collateral 
loan solicitation and processing we originate real estate loans in our market areas by direct solicitation of real estate brokers  builders  depositors  walk in customers and visitors to our internet website 
loan applications are taken by our loan officers or through our internet website and are processed in branch or regional locations 
most underwriting and loan administration functions for our real estate loans are performed by loan personnel at central locations 
we do not make loans originated by independent third party loan brokers or any similar wholesale loan origination channels 
our commercial loan officers solicit commercial and agricultural business loans through call programs focused on local businesses and farmers 
while commercial loan officers are delegated reasonable commitment authority based upon their qualifications  credit decisions on significant commercial and agricultural loans are made by senior loan officers or in certain instances by the board of directors of banner bank and islanders bank 
we originate consumer loans through various marketing efforts directed primarily toward our existing deposit and loan customers 
consumer loan applications are primarily underwritten and documented by centralized administrative personnel 
loan originations  sales and purchases while we originate a variety of loans  our ability to originate each type of loan is dependent upon the relative customer demand and competition in each market we serve 
for the years ended december   and  we originated loans  net of repayments and charge offs  of million  million  and million  respectively 
the increase in net originations for reflects an increase in production of new commercial business and agricultural business loans and commercial real estate loans  as well as a reduction in charge offs 
the decreased level of originations  net of repayments and charge offs  during was significantly impacted by reduced demand from creditworthy borrowers due to weak economic conditions  a substantial amount of loan repayments  and significant charge offs 
we sell many of our newly originated one to four family residential mortgage loans to secondary market purchasers as part of our interest rate risk management strategy 
proceeds from sales of loans for the years ended december   and  totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
sales of loans generally are beneficial to us because these sales may generate income at the time of sale  provide funds for additional lending and other investments  increase liquidity or reduce interest rate risk 
we sell loans on both a servicing retained and a servicing released basis 
all loans are sold without recourse 
the decision to hold or sell loans is based on asset liability management goals  strategies and policies and on market conditions 
see loan servicing 
at december   we had million in loans held for sale 
we periodically purchase whole loans and loan participation interests primarily during periods of reduced loan demand in our primary market area and at times to support our community reinvestment act lending activities 
any such purchases are made generally consistent with our underwriting standards  however  the loans may be located outside of our normal lending area 
during the years ended december  and  we purchased million and  respectively  of loans and loan participation interests 
loan servicing we receive fees from a variety of institutional owners in return for performing the traditional services of collecting individual payments and managing portfolios of sold loans 
at december   we were servicing million of loans for others 
loan servicing includes processing payments  accounting for loan funds and collecting and paying real estate taxes  hazard insurance and other loan related items such as private mortgage insurance 
in addition to earning fee income  we retain certain amounts in escrow for the benefit of the lender for which we incur no interest expense but are able to invest the funds into earning assets 
at december   we held million in escrow for our portfolio of loans serviced for others 
the loan servicing portfolio at december  was composed of million of freddie mac residential mortgage loans  million of fannie mae residential mortgage loans and million of both residential and non residential mortgage loans serviced for a variety of private investors 
the portfolio included loans secured by property located primarily in the states of washington and oregon 
for the year ended december   we recognized million of loan servicing fees in our results of operations  which was net of million of servicing rights amortization 
mortgage servicing rights we record mortgage servicing rights msrs with respect to loans we originate and sell in the secondary market on a servicing retained basis 
the value of msrs is capitalized and amortized in proportion to  and over the period of  the estimated future net servicing income 
for the years ended december   and  we capitalized million  million  and million  respectively  of msrs relating to loans sold with servicing retained 
no msrs were purchased in those periods 
amortization of msrs for the years ended december   and  was million  million  and million  respectively 
management periodically evaluates the estimates and assumptions used to determine the carrying values of msrs and the amortization of msrs 
these carrying values are adjusted when the valuation indicates the carrying value is impaired 
msrs generally are adversely affected by higher levels of current or anticipated prepayments resulting from decreasing interest rates 
at december   our msrs were carried at a value of million  net of amortization 
asset quality classified assets state and federal regulations require that the banks review and classify their problem assets on a regular basis 
in addition  in connection with examinations of insured institutions  state and federal examiners have authority to identify problem assets and  if appropriate  require them to be classified 
historically  we have not had any meaningful differences of opinion with the examiners with respect to asset classification 
banner bank s credit policy division reviews detailed information with respect to the composition and performance of the loan portfolios  including information on risk concentrations  delinquencies and classified assets for both banner bank and islanders bank 
the credit policy division approves all recommendations for new classified loans or  in the case of smaller balance homogeneous loans including residential real estate and consumer loans  it has approved policies governing such classifications  or changes in classifications  and develops and monitors action plans to resolve the problems associated with the assets 
the credit policy division also approves recommendations for establishing the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses 
significant problem loans are transferred to banner bank s special assets department for resolution or collection activities 
the banks and banner corporation s boards of directors are given a detailed report on classified assets and asset quality at least quarterly 
for additional information regarding asset quality and non performing loans  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition comparison of financial condition at december  and asset quality  and tables  and contained therein 
allowance for loan losses in originating loans  we recognize that losses will be experienced and that the risk of loss will vary with  among other things  the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan  general economic conditions and  in the case of a secured loan  the quality of the security for the loan 
as a result  we maintain an allowance for loan losses consistent with gaap guidelines 
we increase our allowance for loan losses by charging provisions for possible loan losses against our income 
the allowance for losses on loans is maintained at a level which  in management s judgment  is sufficient to provide for probable losses based on evaluating known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio and upon continuing analysis of the factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio 
at december   we had an allowance for loan losses of million  which represented of net loans and of non performing loans compared to and  respectively  at december  for additional information concerning our allowance for loan losses  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and provision and allowance for loan losses  and tables and contained therein 
real estate owned real estate owned reo is property acquired by foreclosure or receiving a deed in lieu of foreclosure  and is recorded at the lower of the estimated fair value of the property  less expected selling costs  or the carrying value of the defaulted loan 
development and improvement costs relating to the property are capitalized 
the carrying value of the property is periodically evaluated by management and  if necessary  allowances are established to reduce the carrying value to net realizable value 
gains or losses at the time the property is sold are charged or credited to operations in the period in which they are realized 
the amounts the banks will ultimately recover from real estate may differ substantially from the carrying value of the assets because of market factors beyond the banks control or because of changes in the banks strategies for recovering the investment 
if the book value of the reo is determined to be in excess of the fair market value  a valuation allowance is recognized against earnings 
at december   we had reo of million  compared to million at december  valuation allowances recognized during both and totaled million  compared with million during for additional information on reo  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition comparison of financial condition at december  and asset quality and table contained therein and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
investment activities under washington state law  banks are permitted to invest in various types of marketable securities 
authorized securities include but are not limited to us treasury obligations  securities of various federal agencies including government sponsored enterprises  mortgage backed securities  certain certificates of deposit of insured banks and savings institutions  bankers acceptances  repurchase agreements  federal funds  commercial paper  corporate debt and equity securities and obligations of states and their political subdivisions 
our investment policies are designed to provide and maintain adequate liquidity and to generate favorable rates of return without incurring undue interest rate or credit risk 
our policies generally limit investments to us government and agency including government sponsored entities securities  municipal bonds  certificates of deposit  corporate debt obligations and mortgage backed securities 
investment in mortgage backed securities may include those issued or guaranteed by freddie mac  fannie mae  government national mortgage association ginnie mae or gnma and privately issued mortgage backed securities that have an aa credit rating or higher at the time of purchase  as well as collateralized mortgage obligations cmos 
a high credit rating indicates only that the rating agency believes there is a low risk of loss or default 
to the best of our knowledge  we do not have any investments in mortgage backed securities  collateralized debt obligations or structured investment vehicles that have a material exposure to sub prime mortgages 
however  we do have investments in single issuer and collateralized debt obligations secured by pooled trust preferred securities that have been materially adversely impacted by concerns related to the banking and insurance industries as well as payment deferrals and defaults by certain issuers 
further  all of our investment securities  including those that have high credit ratings  are subject to market risk in so far as a change in market rates of interest or other conditions may cause a change in an investment s earnings performance and or market value 
at december   our consolidated investment portfolio totaled million and consisted principally of us government agency obligations  mortgage backed securities  municipal bonds and corporate debt obligations 
from time to time  investment levels may be increased or decreased depending upon yields available on investment alternatives and management s projections as to the demand for funds to be used in loan originations  deposits and other activities 
during the year ended december   holdings of mortgage backed securities increased million to million  while us treasury and agency obligations increased million to million  corporate securities including equities decreased million to million  and municipal bonds increased million to million

off balance sheet derivatives derivatives include off balance sheet financial products whose value is dependent on the value of an underlying financial asset  such as a stock  bond  foreign currency  or a reference rate or index 
such derivatives include forwards  futures  options or swaps 
through our acquisition of f m bank in  we became a party to approximately million million as of december  in notional amounts of interest rate swaps 
these swaps serve as hedges to an equal amount of fixed rate loans which include market value prepayment penalties that mirror the provision of the specifically matched interest rate swaps 
in addition  in we began actively marketing interest rate swaps to certain loan customers in connection with longer term floating rate loans  allowing them to effectively fix their loan interest rates 
these customer swaps are matched with third party swaps with qualified broker dealers or banks to offset the risk 
as of december   we had million in notional amounts of these customer interest rate swaps outstanding  with an equal amount of offsetting third party swaps also in place 
the fair value adjustments for these swaps and  where appropriate  the related loans are reflected in other assets or other liabilities as appropriate  and in the carrying value of the hedged loans if appropriate 
also  as a part of mortgage banking activities  we issue rate lock commitments to borrowers and obtain offsetting best efforts delivery commitments from purchasers of loans 
while not providing any trading or net settlement mechanisms  these off balance sheet commitments do have many of the prescribed characteristics of derivatives and as a result are accounted for as such 
accordingly  on december   we recorded an asset of  and a liability of  representing the estimated market value of those commitments 
on december   we had no other investment related off balance sheet derivatives 
deposit activities and other sources of funds general deposits  fhlb advances or other borrowings and loan repayments are our major sources of funds for lending and other investment purposes 
scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds  while deposit inflows and outflows and loan prepayments are influenced by general economic  interest rate and money market conditions and may vary significantly 
borrowings may be used on a short term basis to compensate for reductions in the availability of funds from other sources 
borrowings may also be used on a longer term basis for general business purposes  including funding loans and investments 
we compete with other financial institutions and financial intermediaries in attracting deposits 
there is strong competition for transaction balances and savings deposits from commercial banks  credit unions and nonbank corporations  such as securities brokerage companies  mutual funds and other diversified companies  some of which have nationwide networks of offices 
much of the focus of our branch expansion  relocations and renovation has been directed toward attracting additional deposit customer relationships and balances 
in addition  our electronic banking activities including debit card and automated teller machine atm programs  online internet banking services and  most recently  customer remote deposit and mobile banking capabilities are all directed at providing products and services that enhance customer relationships and result in growing deposit balances 
growing core deposits transaction and savings accounts is a fundamental element of our business strategy 
deposit accounts we generally attract deposits from within our primary market areas by offering a broad selection of deposit instruments  including demand checking accounts  negotiable order of withdrawal now accounts  money market deposit accounts  regular savings accounts  certificates of deposit  cash management services and retirement savings plans 
deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required  the time periods the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate  among other factors 
in determining the terms of deposit accounts  we consider current market interest rates  profitability to us  matching deposit and loan products and customer preferences and concerns 
at december   we had billion of deposits  including billion of transaction and savings accounts and billion in time deposits 
for additional information concerning our deposit accounts  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition comparison of financial condition at december  and deposit accounts 
see also table contained therein  which sets forth the balances of deposits in the various types of accounts  and table  which sets forth the amount of our certificates of deposit greater than  by time remaining until maturity as of december  in addition  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
borrowings while deposits are the primary source of funds for our lending and investment activities and for general business purposes  we also use borrowings to supplement our supply of lendable funds  to meet deposit withdrawal requirements and to more efficiently leverage our capital position 
the fhlb seattle serves as our primary borrowing source  although in recent years we have significantly reduced our use of fhlb advances 
the fhlb seattle provides credit for member financial institutions such as banner bank and islanders bank 
as members  the banks are required to own capital stock in the fhlb seattle and are authorized to apply for advances on the security of that stock and certain of their mortgage loans and securities provided certain credit worthiness standards have been met 
limitations on the amount of advances are based on the financial condition of the member institution  the adequacy of collateral pledged to secure the credit  and fhlb stock ownership requirements 
at december   we had million of borrowings from the fhlb seattle 
at that date  banner bank had been authorized by the fhlb seattle to borrow up to million under a blanket floating lien security agreement  while islanders bank was approved to borrow up to million under a similar agreement 
more recently  the federal reserve bank has also served as an important source of borrowings 
the federal reserve bank provides credit based upon acceptable loan collateral  which includes certain loan types not eligible for pledging to the fhlb seattle 
at december   based upon our available unencumbered collateral  banner bank was eligible to borrow million from the federal reserve bank  although at that date we had no funds borrowed under this arrangement 
although eligible to participate  islanders bank has not applied for approval to borrow from the federal reserve bank 
for additional information concerning our borrowings  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition comparison of financial condition at december  and borrowings  table contained therein  and notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we issue retail repurchase agreements  generally due within days  as an additional source of funds  primarily in connection with cash management services provided to our larger deposit customers 
at december   we had issued retail repurchase agreements totaling million  which were secured by a pledge of certain us government and agency notes and mortgage backed securities with a market value of million 
on march   banner bank completed an offering of million of qualifying senior bank notes that are guaranteed by the fdic under the temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp 
these notes require interest only payments for a term of three years with principal payable in full at maturity 
these notes provided supplemental funding which strengthened the liquidity position of the bank  however  going forward we do not anticipate any additional borrowings under the tlgp 
we also may borrow funds through the use of secured wholesale repurchase agreements with securities brokers 
during the three years ended december   we did not have any wholesale repurchase borrowings 
we have also issued million of junior subordinated debentures in connection with the sale of trust preferred securities tps 
the tps were issued from through by special purpose business trusts formed by banner corporation and were sold in private offerings to pooled investment vehicles 
the junior subordinated debentures associated with the tps have been recorded as liabilities and are reported at fair value on our consolidated statements of financial condition  however  at december   all of the million fair value of the debentures qualifies as tier capital for regulatory capital purposes 
we have invested a significant portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the tps as additional paid in capital at banner bank 
for additional information about deposits and other sources of funds  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources  and notes   and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
personnel as of december   we had  full time and part time employees 
banner corporation has no employees except for those who are also employees of banner bank  its subsidiaries  and islanders bank 
the employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit 
we believe our relationship with our employees is good 
taxation federal taxation general for tax reporting purposes  we report our income on a calendar year basis using the accrual method of accounting on a consolidated basis 
we are subject to federal income taxation in the same manner as other corporations with some exceptions  including particularly the reserve for bad debts 
reference is made to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this form k for additional information concerning the income taxes payable by us 
state taxation washington taxation we are subject to a business and occupation b o tax which is imposed under washington law at the rate of of gross receipts 
for many years  this rate had been 
however  on april   the washington state legislature passed a law that temporarily increased this rate to 
this new higher rate will be in effect for the period may  through june  interest received on loans secured by mortgages or deeds of trust on residential properties  residential mortgage backed securities  and certain us government and agency securities is not subject to this tax 
our b o tax expense was million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
oregon and idaho taxation corporations with nexus in the states of oregon and idaho are subject to a corporate level income tax 
our operations in those states resulted in corporate income taxes of approximately   and  net of federal tax benefit for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as our operations in these states increase  the state income tax provision will have an increasing effect on our effective tax rate and results of operations 
competition we encounter significant competition both in attracting deposits and in originating loans 
our most direct competition for deposits comes from other commercial and savings banks  savings associations and credit unions with offices in our market areas 
we also experience competition from securities firms  insurance companies  money market and mutual funds  and other investment vehicles 
we expect continued strong competition from such financial institutions and investment vehicles in the foreseeable future  including competition from on line internet banking competitors 
our ability to attract and retain deposits depends on our ability to provide transaction services and investment opportunities that satisfy the requirements of depositors 
we compete for deposits by offering a variety of accounts and financial services  including robust electronic banking capabilities  with competitive rates and terms  at convenient locations and business hours  and delivered with a high level of personal service and expertise 
competition for loans comes principally from other commercial banks  loan brokers  mortgage banking companies  savings banks and credit unions and for agricultural loans from the farm credit administration 
the competition for loans is intense as a result of the large number of institutions competing in our market areas 
we compete for loans primarily by offering competitive rates and fees and providing timely decisions and excellent service to borrowers 
regulation banner bank and islanders bank general as state chartered  federally insured commercial banks  banner bank and islanders bank the banks are subject to extensive regulation and must comply with various statutory and regulatory requirements  including prescribed minimum capital standards 
the banks are regularly examined by the fdic and state banking regulators and file periodic reports concerning their activities and financial condition with these banking regulators 
the banks relationship with depositors and borrowers also is regulated to a great extent by both federal and state law  especially in such matters as the ownership of deposit accounts and the form and content of mortgage and other loan documents 
federal and state banking laws and regulations govern all areas of the operation of the banks  including reserves  loans  investments  deposits  capital  issuance of securities  payment of dividends and establishment of branches 
federal and state bank regulatory agencies also have the general authority to limit the dividends paid by insured banks and bank holding companies if such payments should be deemed to constitute an unsafe and unsound practice 
under the bank mou  banner bank is not able to pay cash dividends to banner corporation without the prior approval of the washington dfi and the fdic 
the respective primary federal regulators of banner corporation  banner bank and islanders bank have authority to impose penalties  initiate civil and administrative actions and take other steps intended to prevent banks from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices 
state regulation and supervision as a washington state chartered commercial bank with branches in the states of washington  oregon and idaho  banner bank is subject to the applicable provisions of washington  oregon and idaho law and regulations 
state law and regulations govern banner bank s ability to take deposits and pay interest thereon  to make loans on or invest in residential and other real estate  to make consumer loans  to invest in securities  to offer various banking services to its customers and to establish branch offices 
in a similar fashion  washington state laws and regulations for state chartered commercial banks also apply to islanders bank 
deposit insurance the deposits of the banks are insured up to applicable limits by the deposit insurance fund dif  which is administered by the fdic 
the fdic is an independent federal agency that insures the deposits  up to applicable limits  of depository institutions and this insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the united states government 
as insurer of the banks deposits  the fdic has supervisory and enforcement authority over banner bank and islanders bank 
the fdic imposes deposit insurance premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by institutions insured by the fdic 
it also may prohibit any institution insured by the fdic from engaging in any activity determined by regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the institution and the dif 
the fdic also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions and may terminate the deposit insurance if it determines that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or is in an unsafe or unsound condition 
as required by the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank act  the fdic has adopted rules effective april   under which insurance premium assessments are based on an institution s total assets minus its tangible equity defined as tier capital instead of its deposits 
under these rules  an institution with total assets of less than billion will be assigned to one of four risk categories based on its capital  supervisory ratings and other factors 
well capitalized institutions that are financially sound with only a few minor weaknesses are assigned to risk category i 
risk categories ii  iii  and iv present progressively greater risks to the dif 
a range of initial base assessment rates apply to each category  subject to adjustment downward based on unsecured debt issued by the institution and  except for an institution in risk category i  adjustment upward if the institution s brokered deposits exceed of its domestic deposits  to produce total base assessment rates 
total base assessment rates range from to basis points for risk category i  to basis points for risk category ii  to basis points for risk category iii  and to basis points for risk category iv  all subject to further adjustment upward if the institution holds more than a de minimis amount of unsecured debt issued by another fdic insured institution 
the fdic may increase or decrease its rates by basis points without further rulemaking 
as a result of a decline in the reserve ratio the ratio of the net worth of the dif to estimated insured deposits and concerns about expected failure costs and available liquid assets in the dif  the fdic adopted a rule requiring each insured institution to prepay on december  the estimated amount of its quarterly assessments for the fourth quarter of and all quarters through the end of in addition to the regular quarterly assessment for the third quarter which was due on december  
the prepaid amount is recorded as an asset with a zero risk weight and the institution will continue to record quarterly expenses for deposit insurance 
for purposes of calculating the prepaid amount  assessments were measured at the institution s assessment rate as of september   with a uniform increase of three basis points effective january   and were based on the institution s assessment base for the third quarter of  with growth assumed quarterly at annual rate of 
if events cause actual assessments during the prepayment period to vary from the prepaid amount  institutions will pay excess assessments in cash or receive a rebate of prepaid amounts not exhausted after collection of assessments due on june   as applicable 
collection of the prepayment does not preclude the fdic from changing assessment rates or revising the risk based assessment system in the future 
the rule includes a process for exemption from the prepayment for institutions whose safety and soundness would be affected adversely 
we prepaid million in fdic assessments during the fourth quarter of and the balance of the prepaid assessment was million at december  the dodd frank act establishes as the minimum reserve ratio 
the fdic has adopted a plan under which it will meet this ratio by september   the deadline imposed by the dodd frank act 
the dodd frank act requires the fdic to offset the effect on institutions with assets less than billion of the increase in the statutory minimum reserve ratio to from the former statutory minimum of 
the fdic has not yet announced how it will implement this offset 
in addition to the statutory minimum ratio  the fdic must designate a reserve ratio  known as the designated reserve ratio or drr  which may exceed the statutory minimum 
the fdic has established as the drr 
in addition  all institutions with deposits insured by the fdic are required to pay assessments to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the financing corporation  an agency of the federal government established to fund the costs of failed thrifts in the s 
for the quarterly period ended december   the financing corporation assessment equaled basis points for each in domestic deposits 
these assessments  which may be revised based upon the level of dif deposits  will continue until the bonds mature in the years through for  the banks incurred  in fico assessments 
under the dodd frank act  beginning on january   all non interest bearing transaction accounts and interest on lawyers trust accounts iolta qualify for unlimited deposit insurance by the fdic through december  now accounts  which were previously fully insured under the transaction account guarantee program tagp  are no longer eligible for an unlimited guarantee due to the expiration of this program on december  now accounts  along with all other deposits maintained at the banks  are now insured by the fdic up to  per account owner 
the fdic may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution if it determines after a hearing that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations  or has violated any applicable law  regulation  order or any condition imposed by an agreement with the fdic 
it also may suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for the permanent termination of insurance if the institution meets certain criteria 
if insurance of accounts is terminated  the accounts at the institution at the time of the termination  less subsequent withdrawals  shall continue to be insured for a period of six months to two years  as determined by the fdic 
management is not aware of any existing circumstances which would result in termination of the deposit insurance of either banner bank or islanders bank 
prompt corrective action federal statutes establish a supervisory framework based on five capital categories well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
an institution s category depends upon where its capital levels are in relation to relevant capital measures  which include a risk based capital measure  a leverage ratio capital measure and certain other factors 
the federal banking agencies have adopted regulations that implement this statutory framework 
under these regulations  an institution is treated as well capitalized if its ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets is or more  its ratio of core capital to risk weighted assets is or more  its ratio of core capital to adjusted total assets leverage ratio is or more  and it is not subject to any federal supervisory order or directive to meet a specific capital level 
in order to be adequately capitalized  an institution must have a total risk based capital ratio of not less than  a core capital to risk weighted assets ratio of not less than  and a leverage ratio of not less than 
an institution that is not well capitalized is subject to certain restrictions on brokered deposits  including restrictions on the rates it can offer on its deposits generally 
any institution which is neither well capitalized nor adequately capitalized is considered undercapitalized 
undercapitalized institutions are subject to certain prompt corrective action requirements  regulatory controls and restrictions which become more extensive as an institution becomes more severely undercapitalized 
failure by either banner bank and islanders bank to comply with applicable capital requirements would  if unremedied  result in progressively more severe restrictions on its activities and lead to enforcement actions  including  but not limited to  the issuance of a capital directive to ensure the maintenance of required capital levels and  ultimately  the appointment of the fdic as receiver or conservator 
banking regulators will take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements 
additionally  approval of any regulatory application filed for their review may be dependent on compliance with capital requirements 
at december   both banner bank and islanders bank were categorized as well capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations of the fdic 
for additional information  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
standards for safety and soundness the federal banking regulatory agencies have prescribed  by regulation  guidelines for all insured depository institutions relating to internal controls  information systems and internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate risk exposure  asset growth  asset quality  earnings  and compensation  fees and benefits 
the guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired 
each insured depository institution must implement a comprehensive written information security program that includes administrative  technical  and physical safeguards appropriate to the institution s size and complexity and the nature and scope of its activities 
the information security program must be designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information  protect against any unanticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information  protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer  and ensure the proper disposal of customer and consumer information 
each insured depository institution must also develop and implement a risk based response program to address incidents of unauthorized access to customer information in customer information systems 
if the fdic determines that an institution fails to meet any of these guidelines  it may require an institution to submit to the fdic an acceptable plan to achieve compliance 
capital requirements federally insured financial institutions  such as banner bank and islanders bank  are required to maintain a minimum level of regulatory capital 
fdic regulations recognize two types  or tiers  of capital core tier capital and supplementary tier capital 
tier capital generally includes common stockholders equity and qualifying noncumulative perpetual preferred stock  less most intangible assets 
tier capital  which is recognized up to of tier capital for risk based capital purposes after any deductions for disallowed intangibles and disallowed deferred tax assets  includes such items as qualifying general loan loss reserves up to of risk weighted assets  cumulative perpetual preferred stock  long term preferred stock  certain perpetual preferred stock  hybrid capital instruments including mandatory convertible debt  term subordinated debt  intermediate term preferred stock original average maturity of at least five years  and net unrealized holding gains on equity securities subject to certain limitations  provided  however  the amount of term subordinated debt and intermediate term preferred stock that may be included in tier capital for risk based capital purposes is limited to of tier capital 
the fdic currently measures an institution s capital using a leverage limit together with certain risk based ratios 
the fdic s minimum leverage capital requirement specifies a minimum ratio of tier capital to average total assets 
most banks are required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of at least to of total assets 
at december   banner bank and islanders bank had tier leverage capital ratios of and  respectively 
the fdic retains the right to require an institution to maintain a higher capital level based on an institution s particular risk profile 
under the bank mou  we are required to maintain banner bank s leverage ratio at a minimum of 
fdic regulations also establish a measure of capital adequacy based on ratios of qualifying capital to risk weighted assets 
assets are placed in one of four categories and given a percentage weight based on the relative risk of the category 
in addition  certain off balance sheet items are converted to balance sheet credit equivalent amounts  and each amount is then assigned to one of the four categories 
under the guidelines  the ratio of total capital tier capital plus tier capital to risk weighted assets must be at least  and the ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets must be at least 
in evaluating the adequacy of a bank s capital  the fdic may also consider other factors that may affect the bank s financial condition 
such factors may include interest rate risk exposure  liquidity  funding and market risks  the quality and level of earnings  concentration of credit risk  risks arising from nontraditional activities  loan and investment quality  the effectiveness of loan and investment policies  and management s ability to monitor and control financial operating risks 
at december   banner bank and islanders bank had tier risk based capital ratios of and  respectively  and total risk based capital ratios of and  respectively 
fdic capital requirements are designated as the minimum acceptable standards for banks whose overall financial condition is fundamentally sound  which are well managed and have no material or significant financial weaknesses 
the fdic capital regulations state that  where the fdic determines that the financial history or condition  including off balance sheet risk  managerial resources and or the future earnings prospects of a bank are not adequate and or a bank has a significant volume of assets classified substandard  doubtful or loss or otherwise criticized  the fdic may determine that the minimum adequate amount of capital for the bank is greater than the minimum standards established in the regulation 
we believe that  under the current regulations  banner bank and islanders bank exceed their minimum capital requirements 
however  events beyond the control of the banks  such as weak or depressed economic conditions in areas where they have most of their loans  could adversely affect future earnings and  consequently  the ability of the banks to meet their capital requirements 
for additional information concerning banner bank s and islanders bank s capital  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the dodd frank act contains a number of provisions that will affect the capital requirements applicable to the company and the banks 
in addition  on september   the basel committee on banking supervision adopted the basel iii capital rules 
these rules  which will be phased in over a period of years  set new standards for common equity  tier and total capital  determined on a risk weighted basis 
although basel iii is intended to be implemented by participating countries for large  internationally active banks  its provisions are likely to be considered by united states banking regulators in developing new regulations applicable to other banks in the united states  including the banks 
for banks in the united states  among the most significant provisions of basel iii concerning capital are the following a minimum ratio of common equity to risk weighted assets reaching  plus an additional as a capital conservation buffer  by after a phase in period 
a minimum ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets reaching by after a phase in period 
a minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets  plus the additional capital conservation buffer  reaching by after a phase in period 
an additional countercyclical capital buffer to be imposed by applicable national banking regulators periodically at their discretion  with advance notice 
restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses applicable when capital ratios fall within the buffer zone 
deduction from common equity of deferred tax assets that depend on future profitability to be realized 
increased capital requirements for counterparty credit risk relating to otc derivatives  repos and securities financing activities 
for capital instruments issued on or after january  other than common equity  a loss absorbency requirement such that the instrument must be written off or converted to common equity if a trigger event occurs  either pursuant to applicable law or at the direction of the banking regulator 
a trigger event is an event under which the banking entity would become nonviable without the write off or conversion  or without an injection of capital from the public sector 
the issuer must maintain authorization to issue the requisite shares of common equity if conversion were required 
the basel iii provisions on liquidity include complex criteria establishing a liquidity coverage ratio lcr and net stable funding ratio nsfr 
the purpose of the lcr is to ensure that a bank maintains adequate unencumbered  high quality liquid assets to meet its liquidity needs for days under a severe liquidity stress scenario 
the purpose of the nsfr is to promote more medium and long term funding of assets and activities  using a one year horizon 
although basel iii is described as a final text  it is subject to the resolution of certain issues and to further guidance and modification  as well as to adoption by united states banking regulators  including decisions as to whether and to what extent it will apply to united states banks that are not large  internationally active banks 
emergency economic stabilization act of eesa in october  the eesa was enacted 
the eesa authorizes the us treasury department to purchase from financial institutions and their holding companies up to billion in mortgage loans  mortgage related securities and certain other financial instruments  including debt and equity securities issued by financial institutions and their holding companies in a troubled asset relief program  or tarp 
the purpose of tarp is to restore confidence and stability to the us banking system and to encourage financial institutions to increase their lending to customers and to each other 
under the tarp capital purchase program  or cpp  the treasury may purchase debt or equity securities from participating institutions 
the tarp also allows direct purchases or guarantees of troubled assets of financial institutions 
participants in the cpp are subject to executive compensation limits and are encouraged to expand their lending and mortgage loan modifications 
banner completed its tarp cpp transaction on november  and received million in funding from the us treasury department 
the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra on february   president obama signed arra into law 
the arra amends the provisions of the eesa that are applicable to tarp recipients  such as banner corporation 
accordingly  banner corporation is now subject to additional limitations on executive compensation  including a provision for recovery of bonus  retention awards  or incentive compensation paid based on earnings  revenue  gains or other criteria later found to be materially inaccurate  a prohibition on making golden parachute payments including payments on account of termination of employment  a prohibition on paying or accruing any bonus  retention award or incentive compensation except for certain grants of long term restricted stock  and providing tax gross ups 
these restrictions and prohibitions apply to various banner corporation officers  since banner corporation is a participant in tarp cpp 
for additional information regarding the tarp cpp  see item a  risk factors because of our participation in the tarp capital purchase program  we are subject to several restrictions including restrictions on compensation paid to our executives 
temporary liquidity guarantee program following a systemic risk determination  the fdic established a temporary liquidity guarantee program  or tlgp  on october  there are two parts to the program the debt guarantee program  or the dgp  and the transaction account guarantee program  or the tagp  which ended on december  eligible entities generally are participants unless they exercised opt out rights in timely fashion 
banner bank and islanders bank did not opt out of these programs 
for the dgp  eligible entities are generally us bank holding companies  savings and loan holding companies  and fdic insured institutions 
under the dgp  the fdic guarantees certain senior unsecured debt of an eligible entity that was issued not later than october  the guarantee is effective through the earlier of the maturity date or june  for debt issued before april  or december  for debt issued on or after april  
the dgp coverage limit is generally of the eligible entity s eligible debt outstanding on september  and scheduled to mature on or before june   or for certain institutions  of liabilities as of september  the nonrefundable dgp fee ranges from to basis points annualized  depending on maturity  for covered debt outstanding during the period until the earlier of maturity or june   with various surcharges of to basis points applicable to debt with a maturity of one year or more issued on or after april  generally  eligible debt of a participating entity becomes covered when and as issued until the coverage limit is reached  except that under some circumstances  participating entities can issue certain nonguaranteed debt 
various features of the dgp require applications  additional fees  and approvals 
on march   banner bank completed an offering of million of qualifying senior bank notes that are guaranteed by the fdic under the dgp 
these notes require interest only payments for a term of three years with principal payable in full at maturity 
banner bank is required to pay a fee annualized on this debt  which will result in a total fee of million over three years 
none of the senior notes are redeemable prior to maturity 
we do not anticipate any additional borrowing under the tlgp 
for the tagp  eligible entities were fdic insured institutions 
under the tagp  the fdic provided unlimited deposit insurance coverage for non interest bearing transaction accounts typically business checking accounts  now accounts bearing interest at or less  and certain funds swept into non interest bearing savings accounts 
other now accounts and money market deposit accounts were not covered 
on september   the fdic announced that it would not continue the tagp beyond december  as previously indicated  however  under the dodd frank act and the fdic rules  separate temporary coverage for non interest bearing transaction accounts and iolta accounts became effective on december   terminating on december   so that all funds held in such accounts are fully insured  without limit 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of on july   the dodd frank act was signed into law 
the dodd frank act implements far reaching changes across the financial regulatory landscape  including provisions that  among other things  has or will centralize responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating a new agency within the federal reserve board  the bureau of consumer financial protection  with broad rulemaking  supervision and enforcement authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that would apply to all banks and thrifts 
smaller financial institutions  including the banks  will be subject to the supervision and enforcement of their primary federal banking regulator with respect to the federal consumer financial protection laws 
require the federal banking regulators to promulgate new capital regulations and seek to make their capital requirements countercyclical  so that capital requirements increase in times of economic expansion and decrease in times of economic contraction 
provide for new disclosure and other requirements relating to executive compensation and corporate governance 
made permanent the  limit for federal deposit insurance and provide unlimited federal deposit insurance until january  for non interest bearing demand transaction accounts at all insured depository institutions 
effective july   repealed the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits  thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts 
required all depository institution holding companies to serve as a source of financial strength to their depository institution subsidiaries in the event such subsidiaries suffer from financial distress 
many aspects of the dodd frank act are subject to rulemaking and will take effect over several years  making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on banner corporation and the financial services industry more generally 
the elimination of the prohibition on the payment of interest on demand deposits could materially increase our interest expense  depending on our competitors responses 
provisions in the legislation that require revisions to the capital requirements of banner corporation and the banks could require banner corporation and the banks to seek additional sources of capital in the future 
commercial real estate lending concentrations the federal banking agencies have issued guidance on sound risk management practices for concentrations in commercial real estate lending 
the particular focus is on exposure to commercial real estate loans that are dependent on the cash flow from the real estate held as collateral and that are likely to be sensitive to conditions in the commercial real estate market as opposed to real estate collateral held as a secondary source of repayment or as an abundance of caution 
the purpose of the guidance is not to limit a bank s commercial real estate lending but to guide banks in developing risk management practices and capital levels commensurate with the level and nature of real estate concentrations 
the guidance directs the fdic and other bank regulatory agencies to focus their supervisory resources on institutions that may have significant commercial real estate loan concentration risk 
a bank that has experienced rapid growth in commercial real estate lending  has notable exposure to a specific type of commercial real estate loan  or is approaching or exceeding the following supervisory criteria may be identified for further supervisory analysis with respect to real estate concentration risk total reported loans for construction  land development and other land represent or more of the bank s capital  or total commercial real estate loans as defined in the guidance represent or more of the bank s total capital or the outstanding balance of the bank s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased or more during the prior months 
the guidance provides that the strength of an institution s lending and risk management practices with respect to such concentrations will be taken into account in supervisory guidance on evaluation of capital adequacy 
as of december   banner bank s and islanders bank s aggregate loans for construction  land development and land loans were and of total capital  respectively 
in addition  at december  banner bank s and islanders bank s loans on commercial real estate were and of total capital  respectively 
as part of the bank mou  banner bank was required to develop and implement a plan to reduce its commercial real estate concentration 
banner bank has reduced its commercial real estate concentration from at march  to at december  activities and investments of insured state chartered financial institutions federal law generally limits the activities and equity investments of fdic insured  state chartered banks to those that are permissible for national banks 
an insured state bank is not prohibited from  among other things  acquiring or retaining a majority interest in a subsidiary  investing as a limited partner in a partnership the sole purpose of which is direct or indirect investment in the acquisition  rehabilitation or new construction of a qualified housing project  provided that such limited partnership investments may not exceed of the bank s total assets  acquiring up to of the voting stock of a company that solely provides or reinsures directors  trustees and officers liability insurance coverage or bankers blanket bond group insurance coverage for insured depository institutions  and acquiring or retaining the voting shares of a depository institution if certain requirements are met

environmental issues associated with real estate lending the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla is a federal statute that generally imposes strict liability on all prior and present owners and operators of sites containing hazardous waste 
however  congress asked to protect secured creditors by providing that the term owner and operator excludes a person whose ownership is limited to protecting its security interest in the site 
since the enactment of the cercla  this secured creditor exemption has been the subject of judicial interpretations which have left open the possibility that lenders could be liable for cleanup costs on contaminated property that they hold as collateral for a loan 
to the extent that legal uncertainty exists in this area  all creditors  including banner bank and islanders bank  that have made loans secured by properties with potential hazardous waste contamination such as petroleum contamination could be subject to liability for cleanup costs  which costs often substantially exceed the value of the collateral property 
federal reserve system the federal reserve board requires that all depository institutions maintain reserves on transaction accounts or nonpersonal time deposits 
these reserves may be in the form of cash or non interest bearing deposits with the regional federal reserve bank

nor may the federal reserve approve an application if the applicant and its depository institution affiliates controls or would control more than of the insured deposits in the united states or or more of the deposits in the target bank s home state or in any state in which the target bank maintains a branch 
federal law does not affect the authority of states to limit the percentage of total insured deposits in the state which may be held or controlled by a bank holding company to the extent such limitation does not discriminate against out of state banks or bank holding companies 
individual states may also waive the state wide concentration limit contained in the federal law 
the federal banking agencies are authorized to approve interstate merger transactions without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited by the law of any state  unless the home state of one of the banks adopted a law prior to june  which applies equally to all out of state banks and expressly prohibits merger transactions involving out of state banks

dividends the federal reserve has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies  which expresses its view that although there are no specific regulations restricting dividend payments by bank holding companies other than state corporate laws  a bank holding company must maintain an adequate capital position and generally should not pay cash dividends unless the company s net income for the past year is sufficient to fully fund the cash dividends and that the prospective rate of earnings appears consistent with the company s capital needs  asset quality  and overall financial condition 
the federal reserve policy statement also indicates that it would be inappropriate for a company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends 
as part of the frb mou  the company may not declare or pay any dividends on its common or preferred stock without the prior written non objection of the federal reserve 
capital requirements the federal reserve has established capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies that generally parallel the capital requirements of the fdic for the banks  although the federal reserve regulations provide for the inclusion of certain trust preferred securities for up to of tier capital in determining compliance with the guidelines 
the federal reserve regulations provide that capital standards will be applied on a consolidated basis in the case of a bank holding company with million or more in total consolidated assets 
the guidelines require that a company s total risk based capital must equal of risk weighted assets and one half of the must consist of tier core capital 
as of december   banner corporation s total risk based capital was of risk weighted assets and its tier core capital was of risk weighted assets 
the dodd frank act requires new capital regulations to be adopted in final form months after the july  enactment date of the dodd frank act 
many of the dodd frank act s implementing rules and regulations have been delayed and proposed capital regulations were issued by the federal reserve in december  which are subject to a comment period ending in march stock repurchases a bank holding company  except for certain well capitalized and highly rated bank holding companies  is required to give the federal reserve prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption  when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding twelve months  is equal to or more of its consolidated net worth 
the federal reserve may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law  regulation  federal reserve order or any condition imposed by  or written agreement with  the federal reserve 
the company has been informed that it may not repurchase its common stock without the prior written non objection of the federal reserve bank 
we did not repurchase any shares of common stock during the fiscal year

item a risk factors an investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent in our business 
before making an investment decision  you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included in this report 
in addition to the risks and uncertainties described below  other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
the value or market price of our common stock could decline due to any of these identified or other risks  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
the risks discussed below also include forward looking statements  and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
this report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors 
risks associated with our business our business may continue to be adversely affected by downturns in the national economy and the regional economies on which we depend 
our operations are significantly affected by national and regional economic conditions 
weakness in the national economy or the economies of the markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
substantially all of our loans are to businesses and individuals in the states of washington  oregon and idaho 
all of our branches and most of our deposit customers are also located in these three states 
beginning in  washington  oregon and idaho have experienced significant home price declines  increased foreclosures and high unemployment rates  and each state continues to face fiscal challenges  which may have adverse long term effects on economic conditions 
as a result of the high concentration of our customer base in the puget sound area of washington state  the deterioration of businesses in the puget sound area  or one or more businesses with a large employee base in that area  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  liquidity  results of operations and prospects 
in addition  weakness in the global economy has adversely affected many businesses operating in our markets that are dependent upon international trade 
a further deterioration in economic conditions or a prolonged delay in economic recovery in the market areas we serve  in particular the puget sound area of washington state  the portland  oregon metropolitan area  boise  idaho and the agricultural regions of the columbia basin  could result in the following consequences  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations demand for our products and services may decline  loan delinquencies  problem assets and foreclosures may increase  collateral for loans  especially real estate  may decline further in value  in turn reducing customers borrowing power  reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with existing loans  and the amount of our low cost or non interest bearing deposits may decrease 
declining property values have increased the loan to value ratios on a significant portion of our residential mortgage loan portfolio  which exposes us to greater risk of loss 
many of our residential mortgage loans are secured by liens on mortgage properties in which the borrowers have little or no equity because either we originated the loan with a relatively high combined loan to value ratio or because of the decline in home values in our market areas 
residential loans with high combined loan to value ratios will be more sensitive to declining property values than those with lower combined loan to value ratios and therefore may experience a higher incidence of default and severity of losses 
in addition  if the borrowers sell their homes  such borrowers may be unable to repay their loans in full from the sale proceeds 
as a result  these loans may experience higher rates of delinquencies  defaults and losses 
our loan portfolio includes loans with a higher risk of loss 
we originate construction and land loans  commercial and multifamily mortgage loans  commercial business loans  consumer loans  agricultural mortgage loans and agricultural loans primarily within our market areas 
we had approximately billion outstanding in these types of higher risk loans at december  compared to approximately billion at december  these loans typically present different risks to us for a number of reasons  including those discussed below construction and land loans 
at december   construction and land loans were million or of our total loan portfolio 
this type of lending contains the inherent difficulty in estimating both a property s value at completion of the project and the estimated cost including interest of the project 
if the estimate of construction cost proves to be inaccurate  we may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the project 
if the estimate of value upon completion proves to be inaccurate  we may be confronted at  or prior to  the maturity of the loan with a project the value of which is insufficient to assure full repayment 
in addition  speculative construction loans to a builder are often associated with homes that are not pre sold  and thus pose a greater potential risk to us than construction loans to individuals on their personal residences 
loans on land under development or held for future construction also poses additional risk because of the lack of income being produced by the property and the potential illiquid nature of the collateral 
these risks can be significantly impacted by supply and demand conditions 
as a result  this type of lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent on the success of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell the property  rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to independently repay principal and interest 
while our origination of these types of loans has decreased significantly in the last four years  we continue to have significant levels of construction and land loan balances 
most of our construction loans are for the construction of single family residences 
reflecting the current slowdown in the residential market  the secondary market for construction and land loans is not readily liquid  so we have less opportunity to mitigate our credit risk by selling part or all of our interest in these loans 
if we foreclose on a construction or land loan  our holding period for the collateral typically may be longer than we have historically experienced because there are fewer potential purchasers of the collateral 
the decline in the number of potential purchasers has contributed to the decline in the value of these loans 
accordingly  charge offs on construction and land loans may be larger than those incurred by other segments of our loan portfolio 
at december   construction and land loans that were non performing were million or of our total non performing loans 
commercial and multifamily real estate loans 
at december   commercial and multifamily real estate loans were billion or of our total loan portfolio 
these loans typically involve higher principal amounts than other types of loans 
repayment is dependent upon income being generated from the property securing the loan in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service  which may be adversely affected by changes in the economy or local market conditions 
in addition  many of our commercial and multifamily real estate loans are not fully amortizing and contain large balloon payments upon maturity 
such balloon payments may require the borrower to either sell or refinance the underlying property in order to make the payment  which may increase the risk of default or non payment 
this risk is exacerbated in the current economic environment 
at december   commercial and multifamily real estate loans that were non performing were million or of our total non performing loans 
commercial business loans 
at december   commercial business loans were million or of our total loan portfolio 
our commercial loans are primarily made based on the cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower 
the borrowers cash flow may be unpredictable  and collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value 
most often  this collateral is accounts receivable  inventory  equipment or real estate 
in the case of loans secured by accounts receivable  the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers 
other collateral securing loans may depreciate over time  may be difficult to appraise  may be illiquid and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business 
at december   commercial business loans that were non performing were million or of our total non performing loans 
agricultural loans 
at december   agricultural loans were million or of our total loan portfolio 
repayment is dependent upon the successful operation of the business  which is greatly dependent on many things outside the control of either us or the borrowers 
these factors include weather  commodity prices  and interest rates among others 
collateral securing these loans may be difficult to evaluate  manage or liquidate and may not provide an adequate source of repayment 
at december   agricultural loans that were non performing were million or of our total non performing loans 
consumer loans 
at december   consumer loans were million or of our total loan portfolio 
consumer loans such as personal lines of credit are collateralized  if at all  with assets that may not provide an adequate source of payment of the loan due to depreciation  damage  or loss 
in addition  consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower s continuing financial stability  and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss  divorce  illness or personal bankruptcy 
furthermore  the application of various federal and state laws  including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws  may limit the amount that can be recovered on these loans 
at december   consumer loans that were non performing were million  or of our total non performing loans 
if our allowance for loan losses is not adequate  we may be required to make further increases in our provisions for loan losses and to charge off additional loans in the future  which could adversely affect our financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
for the year ended december   we recorded a provision for loan losses of million  compared to million for the year ended december  we also recorded net loan charge offs of million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  despite the decrease from the prior year  we are still experiencing elevated levels of loan delinquencies and credit losses by historical standards 
slow sales and excess inventory in most housing markets  along with declines in property values  have been the primary cause of the elevated levels of delinquencies and foreclosures for residential construction and land development loans  which  including related real estate owned  represent of our non performing assets at december  at december   our total non performing assets had decreased to million compared to million at december  further  our portfolio is concentrated in construction and land loans  commercial business and commercial real estate loans  all of which generally have a higher risk of loss than residential mortgage loans 
if current weak conditions in the housing and real estate markets continue  we expect that we will continue to experience higher than normal delinquencies and credit losses 
moreover  if weak economic conditions in our market areas persist  we could experience significantly higher delinquencies and credit losses 
as a result  we may be required to make further increases in our provision for loan losses and to charge off additional loans in the future  which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio which would cause our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition to be adversely affected 
lending money is a substantial part of our business and each loan carries a certain risk that it will not be repaid in accordance with its terms or that any underlying collateral will not be sufficient to assure repayment 
this risk is affected by  among other things cash flow of the borrower and or the project being financed  in the case of a collateralized loan  the changes and uncertainties as to the future value of the collateral  the duration of the loan  the character and creditworthiness of a particular borrower  and changes in economic and industry conditions 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses  which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense  which we believe is appropriate to provide for probable losses in our loan portfolio 
the amount of this allowance is determined by our management through periodic reviews and consideration of several factors  including  but not limited to our general reserve  based on our historical default and loss experience  certain macroeconomic factors  and management s expectations of future events  our specific reserve  based on our evaluation of non performing loans and their underlying collateral  and an unallocated reserve to provide for other credit losses inherent in our portfolio that may not have been contemplated in the other loss factors 
the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio  including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans 
in determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses  we review our loans and loss and delinquency experience  and evaluate economic conditions and make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends  all of which may undergo material changes 
if our estimates are incorrect  the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio  resulting in the need for additions to our allowance through an increase in the provision for loan losses 
continuing deterioration in economic conditions affecting borrowers  new information regarding existing loans  identification of additional problem loans and other factors  both within and outside of our control  may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses 
our allowance for loan losses was of total loans outstanding and of non performing loans at december  in addition  bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for possible loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge offs  based on judgments different than those of management 
in addition  if charge offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses  we will need additional provisions to increase the allowance for loan losses 
any increases in the provision for loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and capital 
if our non performing assets increase  our earnings will be adversely affected 
at december  and  our non performing assets which consist of nonaccruing loans  accruing loans days or more past due  non performing investment securities  and other real estate owned were million and million  respectively  or and of total assets  respectively 
our non performing assets adversely affect our net income in various ways we do not record interest income on nonaccrual loans  non performing investment securities  or real estate owned 
we must provide for probable loan losses through a current period charge to the provision for loan losses 
non interest expense increases when we must write down the value of properties in our other real estate owned portfolio to reflect changing market values or recognize other than temporary impairment on non performing investment securities 
there are legal fees associated with the resolution of problem assets  as well as carrying costs  such as taxes  insurance  and maintenance fees related to our other real estate owned 
the resolution of non performing assets requires the active involvement of management  which can distract them from more profitable activity 
if additional borrowers become delinquent and do not pay their loans and we are unable to successfully manage our non performing assets  our losses and troubled assets could increase significantly  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
we are required to comply with the terms of memoranda of understanding that we have entered into with the fdic and dfi and the federal reserve and lack of compliance could result in additional regulatory actions 
on march   the fdic and the dfi entered into an agreement on a memorandum of understanding  or bank mou  with banner bank 
under the terms of the bank mou  banner bank may not appoint any new director or senior executive officer or change the responsibilities of any current senior executive officers without the prior written non objection of the fdic and or the dfi  and pay cash dividends to its holding company  banner corporation  without the prior written consent of the fdic and the dfi 
other material provisions of the bank mou require banner bank to maintain tier capital of not less than of banner bank s adjusted total assets pursuant to part of the fdic rules and regulations by july   and maintain capital ratios above well capitalized thresholds as defined under section of the fdic rules and regulations  utilize a comprehensive policy for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan loss  formulate and implement a written plan addressing retention of profits  reduction of overhead expenses and a budget through acceptable to the fdic and the dfi  eliminate from its books all assets classified loss that have not been previously collected or charged off  by june   reduce all assets classified substandard in the report of examination to not more than of tier capital plus the allowance for loan losses  develop a written plan for reducing adversely classified assets  develop a written plan for reducing the aggregate amount of its commercial real estate concentration  and revise  adopt and fully implement a written liquidity and funds management policy 
banner bank is required to provide the fdic and dfi with progress reports regarding its compliance with the provisions of the bank mou 
in addition  on march   the federal reserve bank of san francisco entered into a memorandum of understanding with banner corporation the frb mou 
under the terms of the frb mou  banner corporation  without prior written approval  or non objection  of the federal reserve bank of san francisco  may not appoint any new director or senior executive officer or change the responsibilities of any current senior executive officers  receive dividends or any other form of payment or distribution representing a reduction in capital from banner bank  declare or pay any dividends  or make any other capital distributions including payments on our junior subordinated debentures underlying our trust preferred securities  incur  renew  increase  or guarantee any debt  issue any trust preferred securities  and purchase or redeem any of our stock 
under the frb mou  we also agreed to take any required action to ensure compliance by banner bank with the bank mou and to submit to the federal reserve bank of san francisco for review and approval a plan to maintain minimum levels of capital at banner bank  as well as cash flow projections for banner corporation through and annually thereafter 
we are also limited and or prohibited  in certain circumstances  in our ability to enter into contracts to pay and to make golden parachute severance and indemnification payments 
under the frb mou  the company is required to provide the federal reserve bank of san francisco with quarterly progress reports regarding its compliance with the provisions of the frb mou and banner corporation financial statements 
at december   banner corporation and the banks each exceeded all current regulatory capital requirements including the requirements included in both the bank mou and frb mou 
see item  business regulation  and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding regulatory capital requirements for banner and the banks 
the bank mou and the frb mou will remain in effect until stayed  modified  terminated or suspended by the fdic and the dfi or the federal reserve bank of san francisco  as the case may be 
if either banner corporation or banner bank were found not in compliance with its respective mou  it could be subject to various remedies  including among others  the power to enjoin unsafe or unsound practices  to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice  to direct an increase in capital  to restrict growth  to remove officers and or directors  and to assess civil monetary penalties 
management of banner corporation and banner bank have been taking action and implementing programs to comply with the requirements of the frb mou and the bank mou  respectively 
although compliance will be determined by the fdic  dfi and the federal reserve bank of san francisco  management believes that banner corporation and banner bank have complied and will continue to comply in all material respects with the provisions of each respective mou 
any of these regulators may determine in their sole discretion that the matters covered by the frb mou or the bank mou have not been addressed satisfactorily  or that any current or past actions  violations or deficiencies could be the subject of further regulatory enforcement actions 
such enforcement actions could involve penalties or limitations on our business and negatively affect our ability to implement our business plan  pay dividends on our common stock or the value of our common stock  as well as our financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
our growth or future losses may require us to raise additional capital in the future  but that capital may not be available when it is needed or the cost of that capital may be very high 
we are required by federal regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations 
we may at some point  however  need to raise additional capital to support continued growth or be required by our regulators to increase our capital resources 
our ability to raise additional capital  if needed  will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time  which are outside our control  and on our financial condition and performance 
accordingly  we cannot make assurances that we will be able to raise additional capital if needed on terms that are acceptable to us  or at all 
if we cannot raise additional capital when needed  our ability to further expand our operations could be materially impaired and our financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  if we are unable to raise additional capital when required by our bank regulators  we may be subject to adverse regulatory action 
see we are required to comply with the terms of memoranda of understanding that we have entered into with the fdic and dfi and the federal reserve and lack of compliance could result in additional regulatory actions 
we may have continuing losses and significant variation in our quarterly results 
we reported a net loss of million available to common shareholders during the year ended december  compared to a net loss of million during the year ended december  while significantly improved from last year  our operating results for the year ended december  continued to reflect our high  although declining  levels of delinquencies  non performing loans  net of charge offs and charges related to foreclosed real estate 
in addition  several other factors affecting our business can cause significant variations in our quarterly results of operations 
in particular  variations in the volume of our loan originations and sales  the differences between our cost of funds and the average interest rate earned on investments  special fdic insurance charges  significant changes in real estate valuations and the fair valuation of our junior subordinated debentures or our investment securities portfolio could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
if our investments in real estate are not properly valued or sufficiently reserved to cover actual losses  or if we are required to increase our valuation reserves  our earnings could be reduced 
we obtain updated valuations in the form of appraisals and broker price opinions when a loan has been foreclosed and the property taken in as real estate owned reo and at certain other times during the assets holding period 
our net book value nbv in the loan at the time of foreclosure and thereafter is compared to the updated market value of the foreclosed property less estimated selling costs fair value 
a charge off is recorded for any excess in the asset s nbv over its fair value 
if our valuation process is incorrect  or if property values decline  the fair value of the investments in real estate may not be sufficient to recover our carrying value in such assets  resulting in the need for additional charge offs 
significant charge offs to our investments in real estate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
in addition  bank regulators periodically review our reo and may require us to recognize further charge offs 
any increase in our charge offs  as required by the bank regulators  may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
the value of securities in our investment securities portfolio may be negatively affected by disruptions in securities markets 
the market for some of the investment securities held in our portfolio has become increasingly volatile in recent years 
these market conditions have affected and may further detrimentally affect the value of these securities  such as through reduced valuations because of the perception of heightened credit and liquidity risks 
there can be no assurance that the declines in market value associated with this volatility will not result in other than temporary impairments of these assets  which would lead to accounting charges that could have a material adverse effect on our net income and capital levels 
decreased volumes and lower gains on sales of mortgage loans could adversely impact our non interest income 
our mortgage banking operations provide a significant portion of our non interest income 
we generate mortgage revenues primarily from gains on the sale of single family mortgage loans pursuant to programs currently offered by fannie mae  freddie mac and non gse investors 
these entities account for a substantial portion of the secondary market in residential mortgage loans 
any future changes in these programs  our eligibility to participate in such programs  the criteria for loans to be accepted or laws that significantly affect the activity of such entities could  in turn  materially adversely affect our results of operations 
further  in a rising or higher interest rate environment  our originations of mortgage loans may decrease  resulting in fewer loans that are available to be sold to investors 
this would result in a decrease in mortgage banking revenues and a corresponding decrease in non interest income 
in addition  our results of operations are affected by the amount of non interest expense associated with mortgage banking activities  such as salaries and employee benefits  occupancy  equipment and data processing expense and other operating costs 
during periods of reduced loan demand  our results of operations may be adversely affected to the extent that we are unable to reduce expenses commensurate with the decline in loan originations 
our results of operations  liquidity and cash flows are subject to interest rate risk 
our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control  including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and  in particular  the federal reserve 
changes in monetary policy  including changes in interest rates  could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and investments and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings  but these changes could also affect i our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits  ii the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities and iii the average duration of our mortgage backed securities portfolio and other interest earning assets 
if the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments  our net interest income  and therefore earnings  could be adversely affected 
earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings 
in addition  a substantial amount of our loans have adjustable interest rates 
as a result  these loans may experience a higher rate of default in a rising interest rate environment 
further  a significant portion of our adjustable rate loans have interest rate floors below which the loan s contractual interest rate may not adjust 
approximately of our loan portfolio was comprised of adjustable or floating rate oans at december   and approximately billion  or  of those loans contained interest rate floors  below which the loans contractual interest rate may not adjust 
at december   the weighted average floor interest rate of these loans was 
at that date  approximately billion  or  of these loans were at their floor interest rate 
the inability of our loans to adjust downward can contribute to increased income in periods of declining interest rates  although this result is subject to the risks that borrowers may refinance these loans during periods of declining interest rates 
also  when loans are at their floors  there is a further risk that our interest income may not increase as rapidly as our cost of funds during periods of increasing interest rates which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
any substantial  unexpected  prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
further  a prolonged period of exceptionally low market interest rates  such as we are currently experiencing  could have an adverse effect on our results of operations as a result of substantially reduced asset yields 
also  our interest rate risk modeling techniques and assumptions likely may not fully predict or capture the impact of actual interest rate changes on our balance sheet or projected operating results 
further deterioration in the financial position of the federal home loan bank of seattle may result in future impairment losses on our investment in federal home loan bank stock 
at december   we owned million of stock of the federal home loan bank of seattle  or fhlb 
as a condition of membership at the fhlb  we are required to purchase and hold a certain amount of fhlb stock 
our stock purchase requirement is based  in part  upon the outstanding principal balance of advances from the fhlb and is calculated in accordance with the capital plan of the fhlb 
our fhlb stock has a par value of  is carried at cost  and is subject to recoverability testing 
the fhlb announced that it had a risk based capital deficiency under the regulations of the federal housing finance agency fhfa  its primary regulator  as of december   and that it would suspend future dividends and the repurchase and redemption of outstanding common stock 
as a result  the fhlb has not paid a dividend since the fourth quarter of in august  under the fhfa s prompt corrective action regulations  the fhlb received a capital classification of undercapitalized and has subsequently remained so classified  due to  among other things  risk based capital deficiencies as of march  and june   the deterioration in the value of its private label mortgage backed securities and the amount of accumulated unrealized losses stemming from that deterioration  and the amount of its retained earnings 
on october   the fhlb entered into a consent order with the fhfa 
the consent order required  among other matters  the fhlb meet and maintains certain minimum financial requirements 
the fhlb has communicated that with the exception of a retained earnings requirement  it is in compliance with the minimum financial requirements and has continued taking the specified actions and is working toward meeting the agreed upon milestones and timelines for completing capital management  asset composition  and other operational and risk management improvements as indicated in the consent order 
as a result  we have not recorded an impairment on our investment in fhlb stock 
however  further deterioration in the fhlb s financial position may result in future impairment in the value of those securities 
we will continue to monitor the financial condition of the fhlb and its compliance with the consent order as it relates to  among other things  the recoverability of our investment 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act will  among other things  tighten capital standards  create a new consumer financial protection bureau and result in new laws and regulations that are expected to increase our costs of operations 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank act has had a significant impact on the bank regulatory structure for financial institutions  as well as the lending  deposit  investment  trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies 
the dodd frank act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations  and to prepare numerous studies and reports for congress 
much of the impact of the dodd frank act still remains to be seen in the coming months or years  as the effective dates of the many implementing regulations of the dodd frank act are gradually phased in 
among the many requirements in the dodd frank act for new banking regulations is a requirement for new capital regulations to be adopted within months after the date of enactment of the dodd frank act 
these regulations must be at least as stringent as  and may call for higher levels of capital than  current regulations 
generally  trust preferred securities will no longer be eligible as tier capital  but the company s currently outstanding trust preferred securities will be grandfathered and its currently outstanding tarp preferred securities will continue to qualify as tier capital 
in addition  the banking regulators are required to seek to make capital requirements for banks and bank holding companies countercyclical so that capital requirements increase in times of economic expansion and decrease in times of economic contraction 
certain provisions of the dodd frank act are expected to have a near term impact on banner 
for example  effective july   a federal prohibition on the payment of interest on demand deposits was eliminated  thus allowing businesses to have interest bearing checking accounts 
depending on competitive responses  this significant change to existing law could have an adverse impact on the company s interest expense 
in addition  the dodd frank act created a new consumer financial protection bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws 
the consumer financial protection bureau has broad rule making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions  including the authority to prohibit unfair  deceptive or abusive acts and practices 
the consumer financial protection bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than billion in assets 
financial institutions  such as the banks with billion or less in assets  will continue to be examined for compliance with the consumer laws by their primary bank regulators 
as the company and banks continue to monitor developments under the dodd frank act and to assess the ultimate impact of the legislation and yet to be written implementing rules and regulations on community banks  at a minimum we expect to experience an increase in our operating and compliance costs 
any additional changes in our regulation and oversight  in the form of new laws  rules and regulations  could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or prospects 
increases in deposit insurance premiums and special fdic assessments will negatively impact our earnings 
the dodd frank act established of total insured deposits as the minimum reserve ratio 
the fdic has adopted a plan under which it will meet this ratio by the statutory deadline of september  the dodd frank act requires the fdic to offset the effect on institutions with assets less than billion of the increase in the minimum reserve ratio to from the former minimum of 
the fdic has not announced how it will implement this offset 
in addition to the statutory minimum ratio  the fdic must set a designated reserve ratio or drr  which may exceed the statutory minimum 
the fdic has set as the drr 
as required by the dodd frank act  the fdic has adopted final regulations under which insurance premiums are based on an institution s total assets minus its tangible equity instead of its deposits 
while our fdic insurance premiums initially will be reduced by these regulations  it is possible that our future insurance premiums will increase under the final regulations 
failure to manage our growth may adversely affect our performance 
our financial performance and profitability depend on our ability to manage past and possible future growth 
future acquisitions and growth may present operating  integration and other issues that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition 
liquidity is essential to our business and the inability to obtain adequate funding may negatively affect growth and  consequently  our earnings capability and capital levels 
an inability to raise funds through deposits  borrowings  the sale of loans or investment securities and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity 
our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities on terms which are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general 
factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the washington  oregon or idaho markets in which our loans are concentrated  negative operating results or adverse regulatory action against us 
our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us  such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry in light of the recent turmoil faced by banking organizations and the continued uncertainty in credit markets 
in particular  our liquidity position could be significantly constrained if we are unable to access funds from the federal home loan bank of seattle  the federal reserve bank of san francisco or other wholesale funding sources or if adequate financing is not available at acceptable interest rates 
finally  if we are required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources  our revenues may not increase proportionately to cover our costs 
in this case  our results of operations and financial condition would be negatively affected 
in addition  changes in recent years in the collateralization requirements and other provisions of the washington and oregon public funds deposit programs have changed the economic benefit associated with accepting public funds deposits  which may affect our need to utilize alternative sources of liquidity 
we may engage in fdic assisted transactions  which could present additional risks to our business 
we may have opportunities to acquire the assets and liabilities of failed banks in fdic assisted transactions  including transactions in the states of washington  oregon and idaho 
although these fdic assisted transactions typically provide for fdic assistance to an acquirer to mitigate certain risks  such as sharing exposure to loan losses and providing indemnification against certain liabilities of the failed institution  we are and would be in future transactions subject to many of the same risks we would face in acquiring another bank in a negotiated transaction  including risks associated with maintaining customer relationships and failure to realize the anticipated acquisition benefits in the amounts and within the timeframes we expect 
in addition  because these acquisitions are structured in a manner that would not allow us the time and access to information normally associated with preparing for and evaluating a negotiated acquisition  we may face additional risks in fdic assisted transactions  including additional strain on management resources  management of problem loans  problems related to integration of personnel and operating systems and impact to our capital resources requiring us to raise additional capital 
we cannot provide assurance that we would be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with fdic assisted transactions 
our inability to overcome these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
new or changing tax  accounting  and regulatory rules and interpretations could significantly impact strategic initiatives  results of operations  cash flows  and financial condition 
the financial services industry is extensively regulated 
federal and state banking regulations are designed primarily to protect the deposit insurance funds and consumers  not to benefit a company s stockholders 
these regulations may sometimes impose significant limitations on operations 
the significant federal and state banking regulations that affect us are described in this report under the heading item business regulation 
these regulations  along with the currently existing tax  accounting  securities  insurance  and monetary laws  regulations  rules  standards  policies  and interpretations control the methods by which financial institutions conduct business  implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance  and govern financial reporting and disclosures 
these laws  regulations  rules  standards  policies  and interpretations are constantly evolving and may change significantly over time 
such changes could subject us to additional costs  limit the types of financial services and products we may offer  restrict mergers and acquisitions  investments  access to capital  the location of banking offices  and or increase the ability of non banks to offer competing financial services and products  among other things 
further  regulatory changes to the rules for overdraft fees for debit transactions and interchange fees have the potential to reduce our fee income which would result in a reduction of our non interest income 
our failure to comply with laws  regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies  civil money penalties and or reputational damage  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations  there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur 
our litigation related costs might continue to increase 
the banks are subject to a variety of legal proceedings that have arisen in the ordinary course of the banks business 
in the current economic environment  the banks involvement in litigation has increased significantly  primarily as a result of defaulted borrowers asserting claims to defeat or delay foreclosure proceedings 
there can be no assurance that our loan workout and other activities will not expose us to additional legal actions  including lender liability or environmental claims 
the banks believe that they have meritorious defenses in legal actions where they have been named as defendants and are vigorously defending these suits 
although management  based on discussion with litigation counsel  believes that such proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition  liquidity or operations of the banks  there can be no assurance that a resolution of any pending or future legal matter will not result in significant liability to the banks nor have a material adverse impact on their financial condition  liquidity and results of operations or the banks ability to meet applicable regulatory requirements 
moreover  the expenses of any legal proceedings will adversely affect the banks results of operations until they are resolved 
because of our participation in the tarp capital purchase program  we are subject to several restrictions including restrictions on compensation paid to our executives 
our ability to attract and retain key officers and employees may be impacted by legislation and regulation affecting the financial services industry 
in  the american recovery and reinvestment act arra became law 
the arra  through the implementing regulations of the us treasury  significantly expanded the executive compensation restrictions originally imposed on tarp participants  including us 
among other things  these restrictions limit our ability to pay bonuses and other incentive compensation and make severance payments 
these restrictions will continue to apply to us for as long as the preferred stock we issued pursuant to the tarp capital purchase program remains outstanding 
these restrictions may negatively affect our ability to compete with financial institutions that are not subject to the same limitations 
we are dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel may materially and adversely affect our prospects 
competition for qualified employees and personnel in the banking industry is intense and there are a limited number of qualified persons with knowledge of  and experience in  the community banking industry where the banks conduct their business 
the process of recruiting personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to carry out our strategies is often lengthy 
in addition  the american recovery and reinvestment act has imposed significant limitations on executive compensation for recipients  such as us  of funds under the tarp capital purchase program  which may make it more difficult for us to retain and recruit key personnel 
our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management  loan origination  finance  administrative  marketing and technical personnel and upon the continued contributions of our management and personnel 
in particular  our success has been and continues to be highly dependent upon the abilities of key executives  including our president  and certain other employees 
in addition  our success has been and continues to be highly dependent upon the services of our directors  many of whom are at or nearing retirement age  and we may not be able to identify and attract suitable candidates to replace such directors 
our business may be adversely affected by an increasing prevalence of fraud and other financial crimes 
our loans to businesses and individuals and our deposit relationships and related transactions are subject to exposure to the risk of loss due to fraud and other financial crimes 
nationally  reported incidents of fraud and other financial crimes have increased 
we have also experienced losses due to apparent fraud and other financial crimes 
while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent such losses  there can be no assurance that such losses will not occur 
managing reputational risk is important to attracting and maintaining customers  investors and employees 
threats to our reputation can come from many sources  including adverse sentiment about financial institutions generally  unethical practices  employee misconduct  failure to deliver minimum standards of service or quality  compliance deficiencies  and questionable or fraudulent activities of our customers 
we have policies and procedures in place to protect our reputation and promote ethical conduct  but these policies and procedures may not be fully effective 
negative publicity regarding our business  employees  or customers  with or without merit  may result in the loss of customers  investors and employees  costly litigation  a decline in revenues and increased governmental regulation 
we operate in a highly competitive industry and market areas 
the banks face substantial competition in all phases of their operations from a variety of different competitors 
our future growth and success will depend on our ability to compete effectively in this highly competitive environment 
to date  the banks have been competitive by focusing on their business lines in their market areas and emphasizing the high level of service and responsiveness desired by their customers 
we compete for loans  deposits and other financial services with other commercial banks  thrifts  credit unions  brokerage houses  mutual funds  insurance companies and specialized finance companies 
many of our competitors offer products and services which we do not offer  and many have substantially greater resources and lending limits  name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting business 
in addition  larger competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than the banks do  and newer competitors may also be more aggressive in terms of pricing loan and deposit products than we are in order to obtain a share of the market 
some of the financial institutions and financial services organizations with which we compete are not subject to the same degree of regulation as is imposed on bank holding companies  federally insured state chartered banks and national banks and federal savings banks 
as a result  these nonbank competitors have certain advantages over us in accessing funding and in providing various services 
our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including the following the ability to develop  maintain and build upon long term customer relationships based on top quality service  high ethical standards and safe  sound assets  the ability to expand our market position  the scope  relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands  the rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors  customer satisfaction with our level of service  and industry and general economic trends 
failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position  which could adversely affect our growth and profitability  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
we rely on communications  information  operating and financial control systems technology from third party service providers  and we may suffer an interruption in those systems 
we rely heavily on third party service providers for much of our communications  information  operating and financial control systems technology  including our internet banking services and data processing systems 
any failure or interruption of these services or systems or breaches in security of these systems could result in failures or interruptions in our customer relationship management  general ledger  deposit  servicing and or loan origination systems 
the occurrence of any failures or interruptions may require us to identify alternative sources of such services  and we cannot assure you that we could negotiate terms that are as favorable to us  or could obtain services with similar functionality as found in our existing systems without the need to expend substantial resources  if at all 
if we defer payments of interest on our outstanding junior subordinated debentures or if certain defaults relating to those debentures occur  we will be prohibited from declaring or paying dividends or distributions on  and from making liquidation payments with respect to  our common stock 
as of december   we had outstanding million aggregate principal amount million at fair value of junior subordinated debentures issued in connection with the sale of trust preferred securities through statutory business trusts 
we have also guaranteed these trust preferred securities 
there are currently six separate series of these junior subordinated debentures outstanding  each series having been issued under a separate indenture and with a separate guarantee 
each of these indentures  together with the related guarantee  prohibits us  subject to limited exceptions  from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on  or redeeming  repurchasing  acquiring or making any liquidation payments with respect to  any of our capital stock at any time when i there shall have occurred and be continuing an event of default under such indenture or any event  act or condition that with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute an event of default under such indenture  ii we are in default with respect to payment of any obligations under such guarantee  or iii we have deferred payment of interest on the junior subordinated debentures outstanding under that indenture 
in that regard  we are entitled  at our option but subject to certain conditions  to defer payments of interest on the junior subordinated debentures of each series from time to time for up to five years 
events of default under the indenture generally consist of our failure to pay interest on the junior subordinated debt securities under certain circumstances  our failure to pay any principal of or premium on such junior subordinated debt securities when due  our failure to comply with certain covenants under the indenture  and certain events of bankruptcy  insolvency or liquidation relating to us or the banks 
as a result of these provisions  if we were to elect to defer payments of interest on any series of junior subordinated debentures  or if any of the other events described in clause i or ii of the first paragraph of this risk factor were to occur  we would be prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends on our capital stock  from repurchasing or otherwise acquiring any such capital stock  and from making any payments to holders of capital stock in the event of our liquidation  which would likely have a material adverse effect on the market value of our capital stock 
moreover  without notice to or consent from the holders of our capital stock  we may issue additional series of junior subordinated debentures in the future with terms similar to those of our existing junior subordinated debentures or enter into other financing agreements that limit our ability to purchase or to pay dividends or distributions on our capital stock  including our common stock 
also  banner corporation may not pay interest on the junior subordinated debentures without the prior written non objection of the federal reserve 
there can be no assurance that the federal reserve will continue to allow us to make payments on our junior subordinated debentures 
if we are unable to redeem our series a preferred stock by february  the cost of this capital to us will increase substantially 
the frb mou prohibits us from redeeming our outstanding capital stock without the prior written approval of the federal reserve bank of san francisco 
if we are unable to redeem our series a preferred stock prior to february   the cost of this capital to us will increase substantially on that date  from per annum approximately million annually to per annum approximately million annually

of those offices  approximately half are owned and the other half are leased facilities 
we also have seven leased locations for loan production offices spread throughout the same three state area 
the lease terms for our branch and loan production offices are not individually material 
lease expirations range from one to years 
administrative support offices are primarily in washington  where we have eight facilities  of which we own four and lease four

item legal proceedings in the normal course of business  we have various legal proceedings and other contingent matters outstanding 
these proceedings and the associated legal claims are often contested and the outcome of individual matters is not always predictable 
these claims and counter claims typically arise during the course of collection efforts on problem loans or with respect to action to enforce liens on properties in which we hold a security interest 
we are not a party to any pending legal proceedings that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operations

after consideration of these factors  beginning in the third quarter of  we reduced our dividend payout to preserve our capital and further reduced our dividend in the first quarter of our aggregate dividend payments were also reduced by our one for seven reverse stock split effective june  there can be no assurance that we will pay dividends on our common stock in the future 
under the frb mou  we may not declare or pay any dividends on common or preferred stock or pay interest or principal on the balance of our junior subordinated debentures without the federal reserve bank s prior written non objection 
our ability to pay dividends on our common stock depends primarily on dividends we receive from banner bank and islanders bank 
under federal regulations  the dollar amount of dividends the banks may pay depends upon their capital position and recent net income 
generally  if a bank satisfies its regulatory capital requirements  it may make dividend payments up to the limits prescribed under state law and fdic regulations  however  under the bank mou  banner bank is unable to pay dividends to banner corporation without the prior consent of the fdic and dfi 
in addition  an institution that has converted to a stock form of ownership may not declare or pay a dividend on  or repurchase any of  its common stock if the effect thereof would cause the regulatory capital of the institution to be reduced below the amount required for the liquidation account which was established in connection with the conversion 
banner bank  our primary subsidiary  converted to a stock form of ownership and is therefore subject to the limitation described in the preceding sentence 
in addition  under washington law  no bank may declare or pay any dividend in an amount greater than its retained earnings 
the washington dfi has the power to require any bank to suspend the payment of any and all dividends 
further  under washington law  banner corporation is prohibited from paying a dividend if  after making such dividend payment  it would be unable to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business  or if its total liabilities  plus the amount that would be needed  in the event banner corporation were to be dissolved at the time of the dividend payment  to satisfy preferential rights on dissolution of holders of preferred stock ranking senior in right of payment to the capital stock on which the applicable distribution is to be made  exceed our total assets 
in addition to the foregoing regulatory considerations  there are numerous governmental requirements and regulations that affect our business activities 
a change in applicable statutes  regulations or regulatory policy may have a material effect on our business and on our ability to pay dividends on our common stock 
in addition to the legal and regulatory restrictions described above  certain contractual provisions limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock 
under the securities purchase agreement between us and the treasury  pursuant to which we issued our series a preferred stock and warrant as part of the tarp capital purchase program  prior to november  we could not  without the consent of the treasury  a pay a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock of more than per share or b subject to limited exceptions  redeem  repurchase or otherwise acquire shares of our common stock or preferred stock  other than the series a preferred stock  or any trust preferred securities then outstanding 
in addition  under the terms of the series a preferred stock  we may not pay dividends on our common stock unless we are current in our dividend payments on the series a preferred stock 
dividends on the series a preferred stock are payable quarterly at a rate of per annum for the first five years and a rate of per annum thereafter if not redeemed prior to that time

executive overview we are a bank holding company incorporated in the state of washington and own two subsidiary banks  banner bank and islanders bank 
banner bank is a washington chartered commercial bank that conducts business from its main office in walla walla  washington and  as of december   its branch offices and seven loan production offices located in washington  oregon and idaho 
islanders bank is also a washington chartered commercial bank and conducts its business from three locations in san juan county  washington 
as of december   we had total consolidated assets of billion  total loans of billion  total deposits of billion and total stockholders equity of million 
banner bank is a regional bank which offers a wide variety of commercial banking services and financial products to individuals  businesses and public sector entities in its primary market areas 
islanders bank is a community bank which offers similar banking services to individuals  businesses and public entities located in the san juan islands 
the banks primary business is that of traditional banking institutions  accepting deposits and originating loans in locations surrounding their offices in portions of washington  oregon and idaho 
banner bank is also an active participant in the secondary market  engaging in mortgage banking operations largely through the origination and sale of one to four family residential loans 
while banner corporation experienced marked improvement in  including a return to profitability  weak economic conditions and ongoing strains in the financial and housing markets which accelerated during and generally continued through have created an unusually challenging environment 
this has been particularly evident in our need to provide for credit losses during this period at significantly higher levels than our historical experience and has also adversely affected our net interest income and other operating revenues and expenses 
as a result of these factors  for much of this period we have reported net operating losses 
however  reflecting substantially reduced credit costs and significant improvement in our net interest margin  in we returned to profitability 
for the year ended december   we had net income of million which  after providing for the preferred stock dividend and related discount accretion  resulted in a net loss to common shareholders of million  or per diluted share  compared to a net loss to common shareholders of million  or per diluted share adjusted for the reverse stock split  for the year ended december  although there have been indications that economic conditions are improving  the pace of recovery has been modest and uneven and ongoing stress in the economy will likely continue to be challenging going forward 
as a result  our future operating results and financial performance will be significantly affected by the course of recovery from the recent recessionary downturn 
however  over the past two years we have significantly improved our risk profile by aggressively managing and reducing our problem assets which we believe will lead to further improved operating results in future periods 
our provision for loan losses was million for the year ended december   compared to million recorded in the prior year 
despite the substantial decrease in  the provision was significant in both years and reflects material levels of delinquencies  non performing loans and net charge offs  particularly for loans for the construction of one to four family homes and for acquisition and development of land for residential properties 
from through  higher than historical provision for loan losses has been the most significant factor affecting our operating results and  while we are encouraged by the continuing reduction in our exposure to residential construction loans as well as the significant decrease in non performing assets and the slowdown in the emergence of new problem assets  looking forward we anticipate our credit costs will remain elevated for a few more quarters 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  as well as asset quality below 
aside from the level of loan loss provision  our operating results depend primarily on our net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  consisting of loans and investment securities  and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  composed primarily of customer deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is primarily a function of our interest rate spread  which is the difference between the yield earned on interest earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  as well as a function of the average balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
as more fully explained below  our net interest income before provision for loan losses increased million  or  for the year ended december  to million  which followed an increase of million for the prior year  primarily as a result of an expansion of our net interest spread and net interest margin due to a lower cost of funds and a reduction in the adverse impact of non performing assets 
the trend to lower funding costs and the resulting increase in the net interest margin was driven by rapidly declining interest expense on deposits and represents an important improvement in our core operating fundamentals 
the increase in net interest income occurred despite a modest decline in average earning assets in  as we continued to make changes in our mix of assets and liabilities designed to reduce our risk profile and produce more sustainable earnings 
our net income also is affected by the level of our other operating income  including deposit fees and service charges  loan origination and servicing fees  and gains and losses on the sale of loans and securities  as well as our non interest operating expenses and income tax provisions 
in addition  our net income is affected by the net change in the value of certain financial instruments carried at fair value and in certain periods by other than temporary impairment otti charges or recoveries 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended december   we recorded a net loss of  in fair value adjustments compared to a net gain of million for the year ended december  also  for the year ended december   our net income included a million recovery as the result of the full cash repayment on a security that had been written off as an otti charge in by comparison  for the year ended december  we had net otti charges of million 
our other operating income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  other operating income  excluding fair value and otti adjustments  was million for the year ended december   essentially equal to the prior year 
our total revenues net interest income before the provision for loan losses plus other operating income for were million compared to million for revenues  excluding fair value and otti adjustments  increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this growth in core revenues was the result of the meaningful increase in our net interest income and deposit fees which was partially offset by reduced revenues from mortgage banking activities 
our other operating expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   largely as a result of decreased costs related to real estate owned and fdic deposit insurance which were partially offset by increased compensation expenses 
while lower in than in  both years expenses reflect significant costs associated with problem loan collection activities including professional services and valuation charges related to real estate owned  which should decline in future periods as a result of the continuing reduction in non performing assets 
in addition  in we recorded a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets  which resulted in an million provision for income taxes for the year ended december   despite a pre tax loss of million 
by contrast  for the year ended december   we had pre tax net income of million  with the resulting provision for income taxes offset by an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
as noted above  in the year ended december   our net income included a  net loss in the valuation of the selected financial assets and liabilities we record at fair value  as well as a million recovery of a prior period otti charge 
by comparison  in the year ended december   our net loss included million of net otti charges which were partially offset by million of net fair value gains 
revenues and other earnings information excluding the change in valuation of financial instruments carried at fair value and otti recoveries or losses represent non gaap financial measures 
management has presented these non gaap financial measures in this discussion and analysis because it believes that they provide useful and comparative information to assess trends in our core operations 
where applicable  we have also presented comparable earnings information using gaap financial measures 
for a reconciliation of these non gaap measures  see the tables below  as well as the discussion related to tangible common stockholders equity per share and the ratio of common stockholders tangible equity to tangible assets in footnote number to the key financial ratios tables on page these non gaap financial measures are supplemental and are not a substitute for any analysis based on gaap

our lending activities are primarily directed toward the origination of real estate and commercial loans 
until recent periods  real estate lending activities were significantly focused on residential construction and first mortgages on owner occupied  one to four family residential properties  however  over the past four years our origination of construction and land development loans has declined materially and the proportion of the portfolio invested in these types of loans has declined substantially 
our residential mortgage loan originations also decreased during this four year cycle  although less significantly than the decline in construction and land development lending as exceptionally low interest rates supported demand for loans to refinance existing debt as well as loans to finance home purchases 
despite modest demand  our residential mortgage loan portfolio has increased in amount and as a proportion of our total loan portfolio during this cycle  although residential mortgage loan balances have declined for each of the past two years 
our real estate lending activities have also included the origination of multifamily and commercial real estate loans  including owner occupied loans for our business customers as well as financing for investor owned properties 
our commercial business lending has been directed toward meeting the credit and related deposit needs of various small to medium sized business and agri business borrowers operating in our primary market areas 
reflecting the recessionary economy  in recent periods demand for these types of commercial business loans has been modest and total outstanding balances have declined from peak levels at june   however  originations of commercial loans were substantially higher in than in the previous three years and outstanding balances increased modestly for the year 
our consumer loan activity is primarily directed at meeting demand from our existing deposit customers and  while we have increased our emphasis on consumer lending in recent years  demand for consumer loans also has been modest during this period of economic weakness as many consumers have been focused on reducing their personal debt 
at december   our net loan portfolio totaled billion compared to billion at december  deposits  customer retail repurchase agreements and loan repayments are the major sources of our funds for lending and other investment purposes 
we compete with other financial institutions and financial intermediaries in attracting deposits and we generally attract deposits within our primary market areas 
much of the focus of our branch expansion and marketing efforts have been directed toward attracting additional deposit customer relationships and balances 
the long term success of our deposit gathering activities is reflected not only in the growth of deposit balances  but also in increases in the level of deposit fees  service charges and other payment processing revenues compared to periods prior to that expansion 
for the two years ended december   our total deposit balances decreased largely as a result of our decision to significantly reduce our exposure to brokered deposits and other high cost certificates of deposit 
over the same period we have had a meaningful increase of transaction and savings accounts checking  savings and money market accounts and related fees and payment processing revenues  as we have remained focused on growing these core deposits 
total deposits at december  decreased million to billion  compared to billion a year earlier 
however  over that period certificates of deposit decreased million  while core deposits increased million  with particularly strong growth in non interest bearing checking accounts 
critical accounting policies in the opinion of management  the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition and related consolidated statements of operations  comprehensive income  changes in stockholders equity and cash flows reflect all adjustments which include reclassification and normal recurring adjustments that are necessary for a fair presentation in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements 
various elements of our accounting policies  by their nature  are inherently subject to estimation techniques  valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments 
in particular  management has identified several accounting policies that  due to the judgments  estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies  are critical to an understanding of our financial statements 
these policies relate to i the methodology for the recognition of interest income  ii determination of the provision and allowance for loan and lease losses  iii the valuation of financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value  including otti losses  iv the valuation of intangibles  core deposit intangibles and mortgage servicing rights  v the valuation of real estate held for sale and vi the valuation of or recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
these policies and judgments  estimates and assumptions are described in greater detail below 
management believes that the judgments  estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements are appropriate based on the factual circumstances at the time 
however  given the sensitivity of the financial statements to these critical accounting policies  the use of other judgments  estimates and assumptions could result in material differences in our results of operations or financial condition 
further  subsequent changes in economic or market conditions could have a material impact on these estimates and our financial condition and operating results in future periods 
there have been no significant changes in our application of accounting policies since december  for additional information concerning critical accounting policies  see notes    and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements and the following interest income notes interest on loans and securities is accrued as earned unless management doubts the collectability of the asset or the unpaid interest 
interest accruals on loans are generally discontinued when loans become days past due for payment of interest and the loans are then placed on nonaccrual status 
all previously accrued but uncollected interest is deducted from interest income upon transfer to nonaccrual status 
for any future payments collected  interest income is recognized only upon management s assessment that there is a strong likelihood that the full amount of a loan will be repaid or recovered 
a loan may be put on nonaccrual status sooner than this policy would dictate if  in management s judgment  the interest may be uncollectable 
while less common  similar interest reversal and nonaccrual treatment is applied to investment securities if their ultimate collectability becomes questionable 
provision and allowance for loan losses notes the provision for loan losses reflects the amount required to maintain the allowance for losses at an appropriate level based upon management s evaluation of the adequacy of general and specific loss reserves 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses consistent in all material respects with the gaap guidelines outlined in asc  contingencies 
we have established systematic methodologies for the determination of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses 
the methodologies are set forth in a formal policy and take into consideration the need for an overall general valuation allowance as well as specific allowances that are tied to individual problem loans 
we increase our allowance for loan losses by charging provisions for probable loan losses against our income and value impaired loans consistent with the accounting guidelines outlined in asc  receivables 
the allowance for losses on loans is maintained at a level sufficient to provide for probable losses based on evaluating known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio and upon our continuing analysis of the factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio 
these factors include  among others  changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio  delinquency rates  actual loan loss experience  current and anticipated economic conditions  detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectability may not be assured  and determination of the existence and realizable value of the collateral and guarantees securing the loans 
realized losses related to specific assets are applied as a reduction of the carrying value of the assets and charged immediately against the allowance for loan loss reserve 
recoveries on previously charged off loans are credited to the allowance 
the reserve is based upon factors and trends identified by us at the time financial statements are prepared 
although we use the best information available  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary due to economic  operating  regulatory and other conditions beyond our control 
the adequacy of general and specific reserves is based on our continuing evaluation of the pertinent factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio  including changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio  delinquency rates  actual loan loss experience and current economic conditions  as well as individual review of certain large balance loans 
large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment 
loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment include residential real estate and consumer loans and  as appropriate  smaller balance non homogeneous loans 
larger balance non homogeneous residential construction and land  commercial real estate  commercial business loans and unsecured loans are individually evaluated for impairment 
loans are considered impaired when  based on current information and events  we determine that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
factors involved in determining impairment include  but are not limited to  the financial condition of the borrower  the value of the underlying collateral and the current status of the economy 
impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or  as a practical expedient  at the loan s observable market price or the fair value of collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
subsequent changes in the value of impaired loans are included within the provision for loan losses in the same manner in which impairment initially was recognized or as a reduction in the provision that would otherwise be reported 
our methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance consists of several key elements  which include specific allowances  an allocated formula allowance and an unallocated allowance 
losses on specific loans are provided for when the losses are probable and estimable 
general loan loss reserves are established to provide for inherent loan portfolio risks not specifically provided for 
the level of general reserves is based on analysis of potential exposures existing in our loan portfolio including evaluation of historical trends  current market conditions and other relevant factors identified by us at the time the financial statements are prepared 
the formula allowance is calculated by applying loss factors to outstanding loans  excluding those loans that are subject to individual analysis for specific allowances 
loss factors are based on our historical loss experience adjusted for significant environmental considerations  including the experience of other banking organizations  which in our judgment affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
the unallocated allowance is based upon our evaluation of various factors that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances 
this methodology may result in losses or recoveries differing significantly from those provided in the consolidated financial statements 
while we believe the estimates and assumptions used in our determination of the adequacy of the allowance are reasonable  there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will not be proven incorrect in the future  or that the actual amount of future provisions will not exceed the amount of past provisions or that any increased provisions that may be required will not adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the determination of the amount of the banks allowance for loan losses is subject to review by bank regulators as part of the routine examination process  which may result in the adjustment of reserves based upon their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination 
fair value accounting and measurement notes and we use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain financial assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures 
we include in the notes to the consolidated financial statements information about the extent to which fair value is used to measure financial assets and liabilities  the valuation methodologies used and the impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
additionally  for financial instruments not recorded at fair value we disclose  where appropriate  our estimate of their fair value 
for more information regarding fair value accounting  please refer to note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
other intangible assets notes and other intangible assets consists primarily of core deposit intangibles cdi  which are amounts recorded in business combinations or deposit purchase transactions related to the value of transaction related deposits and the value of the customer relationships associated with the deposits 
core deposit intangibles are being amortized on an accelerated basis over a weighted average estimated useful life of eight years 
these assets are reviewed at least annually for events or circumstances that could impact their recoverability 
these events could include loss of the underlying core deposits  increased competition or adverse changes in the economy 
to the extent other identifiable intangible assets are deemed unrecoverable  impairment losses are recorded in other non interest expense to reduce the carrying amount of the assets 
real estate held for sale notes and property acquired by foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure is recorded at the lower of the estimated fair value of the property  less expected selling costs  or the carrying value of the defaulted loan 
development and improvement costs relating to the property may be capitalized  while other holding costs are expensed 
the carrying value of the property is periodically evaluated by management and  if necessary  allowances are established to reduce the carrying value to net realizable value 
gains or losses at the time the property is sold are charged or credited to operations in the period in which they are realized 
the amounts the banks will ultimately recover from real estate held for sale may differ substantially from the carrying value of the assets because of market factors beyond the banks control or because of changes in the banks strategies for recovering the investment 
income taxes and deferred taxes note the company and its wholly owned subsidiaries file consolidated us federal income tax returns  as well as state income tax returns in oregon and idaho 
income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method 
under this method a deferred tax asset or liability is determined based on the enacted tax rates which are expected to be in effect when the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax basis of existing assets and liabilities are expected to be reported in the company s income tax returns 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
under gaap asc  a valuation allowance is required to be recognized if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized

additionally  the asu clarifies that a description of the valuation techniques s and inputs used to measure fair values is required for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements 
also  if a valuation technique has changed  entities should disclose that change and the reason for the change 
disclosures other than the gross presentation changes in the level reconciliation are effective for the first reporting period beginning after december  the requirement to present the level activity of purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the implementation of this asu did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
comparison of financial condition at december  and general 
total assets decreased million  or  to billion at december   from billion at december  net loans receivable gross loans less loans in process  deferred fees and discounts  and allowance for loan losses decreased million  or  to billion at december   from billion at december  the contraction in net loans was largely due to decreases of million in all categories of construction and land and land development loans and million in one to four family loans  which were partially offset by increases in commercial real estate and commercial and agricultural business loans as well as a decrease in the allowance for loan losses 
further  the decrease in aggregate loan balances for the year reflects our continued efforts to reduce our exposure to certain weaker credits as we aggressively manage problem assets 
importantly  the decrease in total assets also reflects a nearly million decrease in real estate owned 
we continue to maintain a significant  although meaningfully decreased  investment in construction and land loans  however  new originations of these types of loans during the past four years has been restrained by unfavorable market conditions 
as a result of the much slower pace of new originations and continuing payoffs on existing loans  transfers to reo and charge offs  loans to finance the construction of one to four family residential real estate  which totaled million at december   have decreased by million  or  since their peak quarter end balance of million at june  in addition  land and land development loans both residential and commercial have decreased by million  or  compared to their peak quarter end balances at march  given the current housing and economic environment  we anticipate that the aggregate total of construction and land loan balances will continue to decline for the foreseeable future  although the pace of decline will be more modest as originations of new construction loans likely will increase somewhat as inventories of completed homes have been reduced and the build out of existing development projects will be cautiously continued 
while demand for consumer loans remained weak and utilization of existing credit lines for consumer and commercial borrowers was low  our production of new commercial real estate and commercial and agricultural business loans was significantly increased in compared to recent years resulting in approximately million of growth in the balances for these loan categories 
securities increased to million from million at december   however  the aggregate total of securities and interest bearing deposits was nearly unchanged at million at december   compared to million a year earlier 
the increase in the securities holdings reflects a modest extension of the expected duration of this aggregate total investment position designed to increase the yield relative to the rate paid on interest bearing deposits 
during the years ended december  and  net fair value adjustments for trading and available for sale securities had only a modest effect on their carrying values as the investment market experienced reduced volatility as compared to and when relatively large fair value adjustments were recorded 
at december   the fair value of our trading securities was million less than their amortized cost 
the reduction reflected in the fair value of these securities compared to their amortized cost primarily was centered in single issuer trust preferred securities and collateralized debt obligations secured by pools of trust preferred securities issued by bank holding companies and insurance companies  as well as a difference of million in the value of fannie mae and freddie mac common and preferred equity securities  offset by small gains in all other trading securities 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
our available for sale portfolio grew significantly during the year  as purchases of primarily us government and agency obligations exceeded repayment  sales and maturities by million 
periodically  we also acquire securities primarily municipal bonds which are designated as held to maturity and this portfolio increased by million from the prior year end balances 
reo decreased million  to million at december  compared to million at december  the december  total included million in land or land development projects  million in commercial real estate and million in single family homes and related residential construction 
during the year ended december   we transferred million of loans into reo  capitalized additional investments of million in acquired properties  disposed of approximately million of properties and recognized million of charges against current earnings for valuation adjustments or losses related to sold or currently owned properties 
further declines in the value of residential real estate  including in particular building lots and land development projects for residential use  had a material adverse impact on the carrying value of reo and our results of operations for the year ended december  see asset quality discussion below 
deposits decreased million  or  to billion at december   from billion at december  however  non interest bearing deposits increased by million  or  to million from million  and interest bearing transaction and savings accounts increased by million  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  more than offsetting these increases  certificates of deposit decreased million  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  the growth in non interest bearing deposits and other transaction and savings accounts was particularly notable and significantly contributed to our improved net interest margin and deposit fee revenues 
a portion of the decrease in certificates of deposit was in brokered certificates and public funds  which decreased million and million  respectively  from the prior year end balances  however  much of the decrease reflects management s pricing decisions designed to allow maturing higher priced retail certificates to migrate off the balance sheet or into core deposits 
fhlb advances decreased million  to million at december  from million at december   while other borrowings decreased million to million at december  the decrease in fhlb advances reflects maturities of advances and no additional borrowing as a part of our short term cash management activities 
included in other borrowings were million of qualifying senior bank notes covered by the tlgp with a fixed interest rate of and a maturity date of march  this debt  which does not require any collateralization  was issued in march to strengthen our overall liquidity position as we adjusted to a lower level of public funds deposits 
other borrowings at december  also included million of retail repurchase agreements that are primarily related to customer cash management accounts 
retail repurchase agreement balances decreased during the year as many customers elected to keep more of their funds in the related non interest bearing transaction accounts to benefit from the unlimited fdic deposit insurance available to those types of accounts and to receive earnings credit to offset the service fees associated with those accounts 
no additional junior subordinated debentures were issued or matured during the year and the fair value of these instruments modestly increased to million 
for more information  see notes  and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
total stockholders equity increased million to million at december  compared to million at december   primarily due to stock issuances through our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase and sale plan drip in during the year ended december   we issued  additional shares of common stock for million at an average net per share price of through our drip 
the increase in paid in capital from stock issuances  as well as additions to retained earnings as a result of net income from operations and changes in accumulated other comprehensive income  were partially offset by the accrual and payment of preferred and common stock dividends  resulting in the net million increase in stockholders equity 
during the year ended december   we did not repurchase any shares of banner corporation common stock 
investments at december   our consolidated investment portfolio totaled million and consisted principally of us government and agency obligations  mortgage backed and mortgage related securities  municipal bonds  and corporate debt obligations 
from time to time  our investment levels may be increased or decreased depending upon yields available on investment alternatives and management s projections as to the demand for funds to be used in our loan origination  deposit and other activities 
during the year ended december   our aggregate investment in securities increased million 
holdings of us government and agency obligations increased million  mortgage backed securities increased million and municipal bonds increased million 
partially offsetting these increases was a net decrease in corporate bonds of million 
us government and agency obligations our portfolio of us government and agency obligations had a carrying value of million million at amortized cost  with a fair value adjustment of million at december   a weighted average contractual maturity of years and a weighted average coupon rate of 
most of the us government and agency obligations we own include call features which allow the issuing agency the right to call the securities at various dates prior to the final maturity 
certain agency obligations also include step up provisions which provide for periodic increases in the coupon rate if the call options are not exercised 
mortgage backed obligations at december   our mortgage backed and mortgage related securities had a carrying value of million million at amortized cost  with a fair value adjustment of million 
the weighted average coupon rate of these securities was and the weighted average contractual maturity was years  although we receive principal payments on these securities each period resulting in a much shorter expected average life 
as of december   of the mortgage backed and mortgage related securities pay interest at a fixed rate and pay at an adjustable interest rate 
we do not believe that any of our mortgage backed obligations had a meaningful exposure to sub prime mortgages 
municipal bonds the carrying value of our tax exempt bonds at december  was million also with an amortized cost of million  and was comprised of general obligation bonds ie  backed by the general credit of the issuer and revenue bonds ie  backed by revenues from the specific project being financed issued by cities and counties and various housing authorities  and hospital  school  water and sanitation districts located in the states of washington  oregon and idaho  our primary service area 
we also had taxable bonds in our municipal bond portfolio  which at december  had a carrying value of million also million at amortized cost 
many of our qualifying municipal bonds are not rated by a nationally recognized credit rating agency due to the smaller size of the total issuance and a portion of these bonds have been acquired through direct private placement by the issuers 
we have not experienced any defaults or payment deferrals on our municipal bonds 
at december   our municipal bond portfolio  including taxable and tax exempt  had a weighted average maturity of approximately years and an average coupon rate of 
corporate bonds our corporate bond portfolio  which had a carrying value of million million at amortized cost at december   was comprised principally of long term fixed and adjustable rate capital securities issued by financial institutions  including collateralized debt obligations secured by pooled trust preferred securities 
the market for the capital securities deteriorated significantly in and and in our opinion is not currently functioning in a meaningful manner 
as a result  the fair value estimates for many of these securities are more subjective than in periods before nonetheless  it is apparent that the values have declined appreciably  which is reflected in our financial statements and results of operations 
in addition to the disruption in the market for these securities  the decline in value also reflects deterioration in the financial condition of some of the issuing financial institutions and payment deferrals and defaults by certain institutions 
see critical accounting policies above and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   the portfolio had a weighted average maturity of years and a weighted average coupon rate of

loans and lending 
our loan portfolio decreased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to a decrease of million  or  during the year ended december  while we originate a variety of loans  our ability to originate each type of loan is dependent upon the relative customer demand and competition in each market we serve 
reflecting the recession in and and subsequent modest pace of recovery  loan demand has been weak for most of the past four years as consumers and businesses have been cautious in their use of credit 
in addition  in response to weak housing markets we significantly curtailed the origination of new residential construction and land development loans 
as a result  our loan portfolio balances have declined for three consecutive years 
although we are implementing strategies designed to capture more market share and achieved a meaningful increase in targeted loan originations in  looking forward  new loan originations and portfolio balances will continue to be significantly affected by the course of the recovery from the current economic environment 
for the years ended december   and  we originated loans  net of repayments and charge offs  of million  million and million  respectively 
the decreased level of net originations  during and  was significantly impacted by a substantial amount of loan repayments and charge offs 
we generally sell a significant portion of our newly originated one to four family residential mortgage loans to secondary market purchasers 
proceeds from sales of loans for the years ended december   and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
see loan servicing portfolio below 
loans held for sale decreased slightly to million at december   compared to million at december  at various times  we also purchase whole loans and participation interests in loans 
during the years ended december   and  we purchased million   and million  respectively  of loans and loan participation interests 
one to four family residential real estate lending at december   million  or of our loan portfolio  consisted of permanent loans on one to four family residences 
we are active originators of one to four family residential loans in communities where we have established offices in washington  oregon and idaho 
despite the slower economic activity  continued in migration and the unprecedented low mortgage interest rate environment from through has supported demand for residential loans 
in addition  in the spring of we instituted an aggressive advertising and mortgage financial campaign called the great northwest home rush designed to promote the sale of newly constructed homes that we had previously financed 
in working with the home builders and their realtors  the campaign included a significant commitment to advertising and marketing as well as attractive loan rates and terms  and resulted in a substantial amount of home sales and new loan originations 
the combined effects of these factors allowed us to originate a total of million of one to four family residential loans for the year ended december  and a significant portion of these loans were held in our portfolio 
however  our residential loan originations declined to million in  as we had a much reduced inventory of homes eligible for participation in the great northwest home rush program and as home sales slowed following the expiration of the federal government s home buyer tax credit programs 
although activity picked up in the second half of the year  residential loan originations declined further in to million and only a small portion of those loans were placed into the portfolio  as the majority of the new loans were sold in the secondary market 
as a result of that origination and sales activity as well as principal repayments on existing loans and to a lesser extent foreclosure actions  for we had a million decrease in the balance of loans on one to four family residences compared to the prior year 
construction and land lending historically we have invested a significant proportion of our loan portfolio in residential construction loans  as well as land loans and loans for the construction of commercial and multifamily real estate 
however  as noted above  as home housing markets weakened in recent years we significantly reduced our origination of new construction and land development loans 
the slower pace of originations coupled with repayments as a result of home sales and restructuring opportunities as well as charge off and foreclosure actions have allowed our portfolio of one to four family construction loans to decrease substantially over the past four years 
continuing this trend  during the year ended december   one to four family construction loans decreased by million to million and land development loans both residential and commercial decreased by million to million at december  however  a meaningful portion of the decline in land development loans resulted from transfers to reo and charge offs and we continue to believe that land and land development loans represent the most significant source of risk in our loan portfolio 
although significantly below our production levels prior to the beginning of the housing downturn  our construction loan originations have increased for each of the past two years as builders have adjusted to new price levels and certain markets have become more stable 
our construction and land development loan originations totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   and million in at december   construction and land loans totaled million including million of one to four family construction loans  million of residential land or land development loans  million of commercial and multifamily real estate construction loans and million of commercial land or land development loans  or of total loans  compared to million  or  at december  the geographic distribution of our construction and land development loans is approximately in the greater puget sound market and in the greater portland  oregon market  with the remaining in the various eastern washington  eastern oregon and western idaho markets we serve 
while delinquencies and defaults in residential construction and land development loans had a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the past three years  at december   construction  land and land development loans have been reduced to just of total loans and only million were classified as non performing loans 
commercial and multifamily real estate lending we also originate loans secured by multifamily and commercial real estate 
multifamily and commercial real estate loans originated by us are both fixed and adjustable rate loans generally with intermediate terms of five to ten years 
our commercial real estate portfolio consists of loans on a variety of property types with no significant concentrations by property type  borrowers or locations 
we experienced reasonable demand for both multifamily and commercial real estate loans in  and total balances in these categories increased million from the prior year end 
at december   our loan portfolio included billion of commercial real estate loans  or of the total loan portfolio 
our portfolio of multifamily loans was much smaller  at million  or of total loans 
commercial business lending we are active in small to medium sized business lending 
in addition to providing earning assets  this type of lending has helped increase our deposit base 
reflecting the economic environment  demand for new loans remained modest and line utilizations continued to be low in  however  our production levels for targeted loans were encouraging and resulted in a million  or  increase in commercial business loan balances for the year 
this growth occurred despite our successful efforts to reduce our exposure to certain weak or non performing borrowers as we aggressively managed problem assets 
at december   commercial business loans totaled million  or of total loans  compared to million  or  at december  agricultural lending agriculture is a major industry in many washington  oregon and idaho locations in our service area 
while agricultural loans are not a large part of our portfolio  we routinely make agricultural loans to borrowers with a strong capital base  sufficient management depth  proven ability to operate through agricultural cycles  reliable cash flows and adequate financial reporting 
payments on agricultural loans depend  to a large degree  on the results of operation of the related farm entity 
the repayment is also subject to other economic and weather conditions as well as market prices for agricultural products  which can be highly volatile at times 
generally  in recent years  weather conditions  production levels and market prices have been good for most of our agricultural borrowers 
our production levels for agricultural loans were consistent with recent years and at december   agricultural loans totaled million  or of the loan portfolio  compared to million  or  at december  consumer and other lending we originate a variety of consumer loans  including home equity lines of credit  automobile loans  credit cards and loans secured by deposit accounts 
consumer lending has traditionally been a modest part of our business with loans made primarily to accommodate our existing customer base 
in recent years  including  demand for consumer loans has been restrained and outstanding balances have decreased modestly 
at december   we had million  or of our loan portfolio  in consumer loans  compared to million  or  at december  as of december   of our consumer loans were secured by one to four family real estate  including home equity lines of credit 
credit card balances totaled million at december  compared to million a year earlier 
loan servicing portfolio at december   we were servicing million of loans for others and held million in escrow for our portfolio of loans serviced for others 
the loan servicing portfolio at december  was composed of million of freddie mac residential mortgage loans  million of fannie mae residential mortgage loans and million of both residential and non residential mortgage loans serviced for a variety of private investors 
the portfolio included loans secured by property located primarily in the states of washington and oregon 
for the year ended december   we recognized million of loan servicing fees  which was net of million of servicing rights amortization  in our results of operations 
mortgage servicing rights we record mortgage servicing rights msrs with respect to loans we originate and sell in the secondary market on a servicing retained basis 
the value of msrs is capitalized and amortized in proportion to  and over the period of  the estimated future net servicing income 
for the years ended december   and  we capitalized million  million and million  respectively  of msrs relating to loans sold with servicing retained 
no msrs were purchased in those periods 
amortization of msrs for the years ended december   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
management periodically evaluates the estimates and assumptions used to determine the carrying values of msrs and the amortization of msrs 
these carrying values are adjusted when the valuation indicates the carrying value is impaired 
at december   our msrs were carried at a value of million  net of amortization  compared to million at december  table loan portfolio analysis the following table sets forth the composition of the company s loan portfolio  including loans held for sale  by type of loan as of the dates indicated dollars in thousands december amount percent of total amount percent of total amount percent of total amount percent of total amount percent of total commercial real estate owner occupied investment properties multifamily real estate commercial construction multifamily construction one to four family construction land and land development residential commercial commercial business agricultural business  including secured by farmland one to four family real estate consumer consumer secured by one to four family real estate total consumer total loans outstanding less allowance for loan losses net loans table loans by geographic concentration the following table sets forth the company s loans by geographic concentration at december  dollars in thousands washington oregon idaho other total commercial real estate owner occupied investment properties multifamily real estate commercial construction multifamily construction one to four family construction land and land development residential commercial commercial business agricultural business  including secured by farmland one to four family real estate consumer consumer secured by one to four family real estate total consumer total loans outstanding percent of total loans the following table sets forth certain information at december  regarding the dollar amount of loans maturing in our portfolio based on their contractual terms to maturity  but does not include scheduled payments or potential prepayments

the average life of loans typically is substantially less than their contractual maturities because of principal repayments and prepayments 
in addition  due on sale clauses on certain mortgage loans generally give us the right to declare loans immediately due and payable in the event that the borrower sells the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid 
the average life of mortgage loans tends to increase  however  when current mortgage loan market rates are substantially higher than rates on existing mortgage loans and  conversely  decreases when rates on existing mortgage loans are substantially higher than current mortgage loan market rates

this strategy continues to improve our cost of funds and increase the opportunity for deposit fee revenues  while stabilizing our funding base 
although total deposits decreased million  to billion at december  from billion at december   non interest bearing deposits increased by million  or  to million at year end from million at december   and interest bearing transaction and savings accounts increased by million  or to billion at december  compared to billion a year earlier 
this core deposit growth augmented similarly strong results in and coupled with significantly better pricing was primarily responsible for the much improved net interest margin we experienced in more than offsetting these increases  certificates of deposit decreased million  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  following much larger declines in and  public fund deposits decreased million during  as we continued to manage the reduction of these deposits in response to increased collateralization requirements under the washington and oregon state public deposit protection regulations 
a portion of the decrease in certificates of deposit was in brokered certificates  which decreased million from the prior year end balances  however  much of the decrease reflects a reduction in retail certificates as a result of management s pricing decisions designed to allow maturing higher priced certificates to migrate off the balance sheet or into core deposit accounts 
deposits generally are attracted from within our primary market areas through the offering of a broad selection of deposit instruments  including demand checking accounts  now accounts  money market deposit accounts  regular savings accounts  certificates of deposit  cash management services and retirement savings plans 
deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required  the time periods the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate  among other factors

to access funds  we are required to own a sufficient level of capital stock in the fhlb seattle and may apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain of our mortgage loans and securities provided that certain creditworthiness standards have been met 
at december   we had million of borrowings from the fhlb seattle at fair value at a weighted average rate of  a decrease of million compared to a year earlier 
also at december   we had an investment of million in fhlb seattle capital stock

the federal reserve bank provides credit based upon acceptable loan collateral  which includes certain loan types not eligible for pledging to the fhlb seattle 
at december   based upon our available unencumbered collateral  banner bank was eligible to borrow million from the federal reserve bank  however  at that date we had no funds borrowed under this arrangement 
in march  we completed an offering of million of senior bank notes under the fdic temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp at a fixed rate of  although the actual expense  including the fdic guarantee fee and amortization of origination cost  is 
this debt  which does not require any collateralization  was issued in march to strengthen our overall liquidity position

we also issue retail repurchase agreements to customers that are primarily related to customer cash management accounts and in the past have borrowed funds through the use of secured wholesale repurchase agreements with securities brokers 
in each case  the repurchase agreements are generally due within days 
at december   retail repurchase agreements totaling million  with a weighted average rate of  were secured by a pledge of certain mortgage backed securities and agency securities with a market value of million

asset quality while non performing assets declined substantially in  over the past four years as housing markets deteriorated in many of our primary service areas we experienced significantly higher levels of delinquencies and non performing assets  primarily in our construction and land development loan portfolios 
beginning in the third quarter of and continuing throughout and  home and lot sales activity was exceptionally slow  causing stress on builders and developers cash flows and their ability to service debt  which was reflected in our increased non performing asset totals 
further  property values generally declined during this period  reducing the value of the collateral securing loans 
in addition  other non housing related segments of the loan portfolio developed signs of stress and increasing levels of non performing loans as the effects of the recessionary economy became more evident and the pace of the recovery remained slow 
as a result  for the years ended december   and  our provision for loan losses was significantly higher than historical levels and our normal expectations 
this higher than normal level of delinquencies and nonaccruals also had a material adverse effect on operating income as a result of foregone interest revenues  increased loan collection costs and carrying costs and valuation adjustments for real estate acquired through foreclosure 
while our non performing assets have been materially reduced and we are actively engaged with our borrowers in resolving remaining problem assets  our future results will continue to be meaningfully influenced by the course of recovery from the economic recession 
however  although property values continued to decline in most markets in  our reserve levels are substantial and  as a result of our impairment analysis and charge off actions  reflect current appraisals and valuation estimates as well as recent regulatory examination results 
non performing assets decreased to million  or of total assets  at december   from million  or of total assets  at december   and million  or of total assets  at december  construction and land development loans  including related reo  represented approximately of our non performing assets at december  reflecting lingering weakness in the economy and lower property values  during we continued to provide for loan losses at a relatively high level and maintained a substantial allowance for loan losses at year end even though non performing loans and total loans outstanding declined 
at december   our allowance for loan losses was million  or of total loans and of non performing loans  compared to million  or of total loans and of non performing loans at december  included in our allowance at december  was an unallocated portion of million  which is based upon our evaluation of various factors that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances 
we continue to believe our level of non performing loans and assets  which declined significantly during the year  is manageable and we believe that we have sufficient capital and human resources to manage the collection of our non performing assets in an orderly fashion 
however  our operating results will continue to be adversely impacted while we work to further reduce the level of our non performing assets 
while non performing assets are geographically distributed  they are concentrated largely in land and land development loans 
the primary components of the million in non performing assets are million in nonaccrual loans  including million of construction and land development loans  and million in reo and other repossessed assets 
the geographic distribution of the million of non performing construction  land and land development loans and related reo included approximately million  or  in the puget sound region  million  or  in the greater portland market area  million  or  in the greater boise market area  and million  or  in other areas of washington  oregon and idaho 
loans are reported as restructured when we grant concessions to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties that we would not otherwise consider 
as a result of these concessions  restructured loans are impaired as the banks will not collect all amounts due  both principal and interest  in accordance with the terms of the original loan agreement 
if any restructured loan becomes delinquent or other matters call into question the borrower s ability to repay full interest and principal in accordance with the restructured terms  the restructured loan s would be reclassified as nonaccrual 
at december   we had million of restructured loans currently performing under their restructured terms 
the following table sets forth information with respect to our non performing assets and restructured loans  at the dates indicated dollars in thousands table non performing assets december nonaccrual loans secured by real estate commercial multifamily construction land one to four family commercial business agricultural business  including secured by farmland consumer loans more than days delinquent  still on accrual secured by real estate commercial multifamily construction land one to four family commercial business agricultural business  including secured by farmland consumer total non performing loans securities on nonaccrual at fair value reo assets held for sale  net other repossessed assets held for sale  net total non performing assets total non performing loans to net loans before allowance for loan losses total non performing loans to total assets total non performing assets to total assets restructured loans loans days past due and on accrual for the year ended december   million in interest income would have been recorded had nonaccrual loans been current  and no interest income on these loans was included in net income for this period 
real estate acquired by us as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as real estate held for sale until it is sold 
when property is acquired  it is recorded at the lower of the estimated fair value of the property  less expected selling costs  or the carrying value of the defaulted loan 
subsequent to foreclosure  the property is carried at the lower of the foreclosed amount or net realizable value 
upon receipt of a new appraisal and market analysis  the carrying value is written down through the establishment of a specific reserve to the anticipated sales price  less selling and holding costs 
these loans are performing under their restructured terms 
in addition to the non performing loans noted in table  as of december   we had classified loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of million that are not on nonaccrual status  with respect to which known information concerning possible credit problems with the borrowers or the cash flows of the properties securing the respective loans has caused management to be concerned about the ability of the borrowers to comply with present loan repayment terms 
this may result in the future inclusion of such loans in the nonaccrual loan category

the decrease in credit costs reflects a substantially reduced level of non performing assets while the increase in revenues was driven by significant improvement in our net interest income and deposit fees and other service charges fueled by growth in core deposits 
for the year ended december   we had net income of million  which  after providing for the preferred stock dividend of million and related discount accretion of million  resulted in a net loss to common shareholders of million  or per diluted share 
this compares to a net loss to common shareholders of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  our provision for loan losses was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year 
our results for also included an million provision for income taxes  despite a pre tax loss  as we recorded a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets 
by contrast  for the year ended december   we had pre tax net income of million  with the resulting provision for income taxes offset by an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance 
aside from credit costs  our operating results depend largely on our net interest income which  as explained below  increased by million to million  primarily because of a significant reduction in deposit costs and a reduction in the adverse effect of non performing assets  and was the most important component of our growth in revenues from core operations 
our operating results for the year ended december  also included an increase in other operating income  which was particularly influenced by a million recovery of a previous otti charge which was partially offset by a net loss of  as a result of changes in the valuation of financial instruments carried at fair value 
by comparison  for the year ended december   we recorded million of otti charges  which were partially offset by million in net fair value gains 
excluding these fair value and otti adjustments  our other operating income was nearly unchanged at million for the year ended december  compared to the preceding year  as increased deposit fees and other service charges were generally offset by decreased gains on the sale of loans from mortgage banking operations 
other operating expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   a decrease of from the prior year  largely as a result of decreased costs related to reo and fdic deposit insurance 
net interest income 
net interest income before provision for loan losses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million one year earlier  primarily as a result of an increase in the net interest margin and despite a modest decrease in average interest earning assets 
the net interest margin of for the year ended december  increased basis points from the prior year  largely as a result of the effect of a much lower cost of deposits which more than offset a further decrease in asset yields 
while less severe than in the preceding year as a result of the significant reduction in problem assets  our net interest margin continued to be adversely affected by the high level of nonaccrual loans and other non performing assets 
however  nonaccruing loans reduced the margin by basis points during the year ended december   a meaningful improvement compared to a basis point reduction for the prior year 
in addition  the mix of earning assets changed to include fewer loans and more securities and interest bearing deposits as our on balance sheet liquidity remained high 
this continued shift in the mix in the very low interest rate environment had a further adverse effect on earning asset yields 
reflecting generally lower market interest rates as well as changes in asset mix  the yield on earning assets for the year ended december  decreased by basis points compared to the prior year 
more importantly  funding costs were also significantly lower  especially deposit costs which decreased basis points to from a year earlier  more than offsetting the decline in asset yields 
as a result  the net interest spread expanded to for the year ended december  compared to for the prior year and was only partially offset by the decline in average interest earning assets 
interest income 
interest income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the prior year  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in interest income occurred as a result of a million decrease in the average balance of interest earning assets  as well as a basis point decrease in the average yield on those assets 
the yield on average interest earning assets decreased to for the year ended december   compared to one year earlier  largely as a result of changes in the mix of assets and the impact of lower market rates on the securities portfolio 
the federal reserve continued monetary policy actions during the year designed to maintain short term market interest rates at the extremely low levels of the past three years and initiated further actions to move intermediate and longer term rates even lower in despite the pressure from lower market interest rates  our loan yields were only modestly lower at for the year ended december  compared to in the preceding year largely because of a decrease in the amount of non performing loans 
average loans receivable for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to billion  compared to billion for the prior year 
interest income on loans decreased by million  or  to million for the year from million for the year ended december   reflecting the decreased average balance and the lower average yield on loans 
the combined average balance of mortgage backed securities  investment securities  daily interest bearing deposits and fhlb stock increased by million excluding the effect of fair value adjustments for the year ended december   and the interest and dividend income from those investments increased by  compared to the prior year 
the effect of the increased average balance was nearly offset as the average yield on the securities portfolio and cash equivalents decreased to for the year ended december   from one year earlier 
the modest decrease in the combined yield on these investments despite declining market interest rates  reflects a change in the mix to include lower balances of daily interest bearing deposits and more investment securities  primarily us government agency securities  which helped to offset the adverse impact of lower market rates 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the prior year  a decrease of million  or 
the sharp decline in interest expense occurred as a result of a basis point decrease in the average cost of all interest bearing liabilities to for the year ended december   from one year earlier  and a million  or  decrease in average interest bearing liabilities 
the decrease in average interest bearing balances reflects a substantial decrease in the average balance of certificates of deposit  as well as a decrease in fhlb advances and other borrowings  which were only partially offset by increases in transaction and savings accounts 
deposit interest expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year as a result of a basis point decrease in the cost of deposits despite a million decrease in the average balance of deposits 
average deposit balances decreased to billion for the year ended december   from billion for the year ended december   while the average rate paid on deposit balances decreased to in the current year from for the prior year 
deposit costs are significantly affected by changes in the level of market interest rates  however  changes in the average rate paid for interest bearing deposits frequently tend to be less severe and to lag changes in market interest rates 
in addition  non interest bearing deposits dampen the effect of changes in market rates on our aggregate cost of deposits 
this lower degree of volatility and lag effect for deposit pricing have been evident in the continuing decrease in deposit costs as the federal reserve pursued policies beginning in first to aggressively lower short term interest rates and subsequently to maintain the very low level of interest rates 
furthermore  competitive pricing pressure for interest bearing deposits was quite intense for certain periods two to three years ago  as many financial institutions experienced increased liquidity concerns in the deteriorating economic conditions 
however  as market rates have remained low for an extended period  competitors liquidity strains have been generally mitigated and certificates of deposit issued at those times have reached maturity  we experienced significantly declining deposit costs during  and further  continued changes in our deposit mix  reflecting growth in lower cost transaction and savings accounts as a result of our branch network continuing to mature and the successful execution of targeted marketing strategies  have also meaningfully contributed to the decrease in our funding costs 
while we do not anticipate further significant reductions in market interest rates  we do expect some additional though more modest declines in deposit costs over the near term as certificate of deposit maturities will present further repricing opportunities and competitive pricing should remain restrained in response to modest loan demand in the current economic environment 
the growth in non interest bearing deposits and other transaction and savings accounts was particularly notable and significantly contributed to our improved net interest margin and deposit fee revenues 
average fhlb advances excluding the effect of fair value adjustments decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year 
the decline in outstanding fhlb advances was primarily responsible for a  decrease in the related interest expense as the average rate paid on fhlb advances remained nearly unchanged for the years ended december  and at and  respectively 
other borrowings consist of retail repurchase agreements with customers  secured by certain investment securities  the senior bank notes issued under the tlgp  and in some years  overnight federal funds borrowings from the federal reserve bank and correspondent banks 
the average balance for other borrowings  consisting of customer retail repurchase agreements and senior bank notes  was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million compared to the prior year  while the related interest expense for other borrowings decreased by  to million for the year ended december   from million one year earlier 
all of the decrease in average balance and interest expense was related to the retail repurchase agreements  as there was no change in the senior bank notes during the year 
as a result  the average rate paid on other borrowings increased eight basis points to for the year ended december   compared to one year earlier 
junior subordinated debentures which were issued in connection with trust preferred securities had an average balance excluding the effect of fair value adjustments of million for both the years ended december  and the average rate decreased slightly to for compared to for these junior subordinated debentures are adjustable rate instruments with repricing frequencies of three months based upon the three month libor index 
the slightly lower average cost of the junior subordinated debentures in the current year reflects the relatively minor difference in the average three month libor rate for the two year period

provision and allowance for loan losses 
during the year ended december   the provision for loan losses was million  compared to million for the year ended december  as discussed in the summary of critical accounting policies section above and in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the provision and allowance for loan losses is one of the most critical accounting estimates included in our consolidated financial statements 
the provision for loan losses reflects the amount required to maintain the allowance for losses at an appropriate level based upon management s evaluation of the adequacy of general and specific loss reserves  trends in delinquencies and net charge offs and current economic conditions 
while our provision for loan losses was substantially less in the year ended december  than in  it remained elevated in relation to historical loss rates prior to the economic downturn in response to still high levels of delinquencies  non performing assets and net charge offs as well as declining property values during the year 
however  all of these asset quality indicators improved significantly throughout the year  allowing us to decrease the level of provisioning as the year progressed and compared to the prior year 
although the provision for loan losses for the year ended december  continued to largely reflect material levels of delinquencies and net charge offs for construction  land and land development loans  our exposure to these types of loans was further reduced during the year as problem asset resolutions occurred 
the provision and allowance for loan losses also continue to reflect our concerns that the significant number of distressed sellers in the market and additional expected lender foreclosures may further disrupt certain housing markets and adversely affect home prices and the demand for building lots 
these concerns have remained elevated during the past three years as price declines for housing and related lot and land markets have occurred in most areas of the puget sound and portland regions where a significant portion of our one to four family residential and construction and development loans and are located 
aside from housing related construction and development loans  non performing loans often reflect unique operating difficulties for the individual borrower  however  the weak pace of general economic activity and declining commercial real estate values have been significant contributing factors to more recent late cycle defaults in other non housing related segments of the portfolio 
we recorded net charge offs of million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year  and non performing loans decreased by million during the year to million at december   compared to million at december   a comparison of the allowance for loan losses at december  and reflects a decrease of million  or  to million at december   from million at december  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans loans receivable excluding allowance for losses decreased to at december   compared to at december  however  as a result of the reduction in problem loans  the allowance as a percentage of non performing loans increased to at december   compared to a year earlier 
as of december   we had identified million of impaired loans 
impaired loans are comprised of loans on nonaccrual  tdrs that are performing under their restructured terms and loans that are days or more past due  but are still on accrual 
impaired loans may be evaluated for reserve purposes using either a specific impairment analysis or collectively evaluated as part of homogeneous pools 
loans totaling million were subjected to a specific impairment analysis and of those loans  million were found to not require a specific loss allowance for credit losses at december  as their estimated collateral value was equal to or exceeded their carrying costs  which in some cases was net of substantial write offs 
the remaining million of loans subjected to a specific impairment analysis were found to require specific allowances totaling million 
impaired loans that were collectively evaluated for reserve purposes within homogeneous pools totaled million and were found to require allowances totaling million 
the million evaluated for reserve purposes within homogeneous pools included million of restructured loans which are currently performing according to their restructured terms 
we believe that the allowance for loan losses as of december  was adequate to absorb the known and inherent risks of loss in the loan portfolio at that date 
while we believe the estimates and assumptions used in our determination of the adequacy of the allowance are reasonable  there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will not be proven incorrect in the future  or that the actual amount of future provisions will not exceed the amount of past provisions or that any increased provisions that may be required will not adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the determination of the amount of the allowance for loan losses is subject to review by bank regulators as part of the routine examination process  which may result in the establishment of additional reserves based upon their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination 
the following table sets forth an analysis of our allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated dollars in thousands table changes in allowance for loan losses years ended december balance  beginning of period provision allowances added through business combinations recoveries of loans previously charged off commercial real estate multifamily real estate construction and land commercial business agricultural business  including secured by farmland one to four family real estate consumer loans charged off commercial real estate multifamily real estate construction and land commercial business agricultural business  including secured by farmland one to four family real estate consumer net charge offs balance  end of period allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans net loan charge offs as a percent of average outstanding loans during the period allowance for loan losses as a percent of non performing loans the following table sets forth the breakdown of the allowance for loan losses by loan category at the dates indicated dollars in thousands table allocation of allowance for loan losses december amount percent of loans in each category to total loans amount percent of loans in each category to total loans amount percent of loans in each category to total loans amount percent of loans in each category to total loans amount percent of loans in each category to total loans specific or allocated loss allowances commercial real estate multifamily real estate construction and land commercial business agricultural business  including secured by farmland one to four family real estate consumer total allocated estimated allowance for undisbursed commitments n a n a n a n a n a unallocated n a n a n a n a n a total allowance for loan losses we establish specific loss allowances when individual loans are identified that present a possibility of loss ie  that full collectability is not reasonably assured 
the remainder of the allocated and unallocated allowance for loan losses is established for the purpose of providing for estimated losses which are inherent in the loan portfolio 
other operating income 
other operating income  which includes changes in the valuation of financial instruments carried at fair value as well as non interest revenues from core operations  increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to a million recovery of a security that had been written off as an otti charge in the prior year  which was partially offset by a million unfavorable variance in net fair value adjustments compared to the prior year 
excluding the fair value and otti adjustments  other operating income from core operations remained essentially unchanged at million for the years ended december  and  as increased deposit fees and other service charges were offset by decreased revenues from mortgage banking activity 
importantly  and primarily as a result of growth in our customer base  income from deposit fees and other service charges increased by  or approximately  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year 
while our mortgage banking activity increased in the second half of the year  gain on sale of loans decreased by million to million for the full year ended december   compared to million in the prior year 
loan sales for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to million for the year ended december  by contrast  loan servicing fee income increased  compared to the prior year  reflecting an increase in the balance of loans serviced for others 
miscellaneous revenues also increased modestly  largely as a result of increased fees associated with interest rate swaps which were partially offset by lower returns on bank owned life insurance 
for the year ended december   we recorded a net charge of  for changes in the valuation of financial instruments carried at fair value  compared to a net gain of million for the year ended december  the adjustments in primarily reflect changes in the valuation of the junior subordinated debentures we have issued  which resulted in million in charges that were partially offset by net gains in the values of certain investment securities 
the net fair value gain in was largely a result of the impact of lower market interest rates on the valuation of certain fixed rate securities 
additionally  in  we had a million recovery as a result of the full cash repayment of a trust preferred security issued by a commercial bank that had been written off as an otti charge in for the year ended december   we had total otti charges of million  while in we did not experience any otti charges 
as discussed more thoroughly in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the valuation for many of these financial instruments has become very difficult and more subjective in recent periods as current and reliable observable transaction data does not exist 
other operating expenses 
other operating expenses for the year ended december  totaled million compared to million in  a decrease of million  or  compared to the prior year  largely as a result of decreased costs related to reo and fdic deposit insurance which were partially offset by increased compensation expenses 
while lower in than in  both years expenses reflect significant charges related to reo operations  including holding costs  losses on sales and valuation adjustments on foreclosed properties 
total reo expenses were million  including million of losses and valuation adjustments  for the year ended december   compared to million  including million of losses and valuation adjustments  for the year ended december  importantly  however  our total reo was reduced by nearly million during to million at december   compared to million a year earlier 
the cost of fdic insurance decreased by million compared to the prior year  largely because of changes in the assessment formula mandated in the dodd frank act 
salary and employee benefits increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily reflecting changes in compensation levels and benefit costs 
the increase in compensation costs was partially offset by an  increase in the amount of the credit for capitalized loan origination costs as a result of increased new loan originations and a  reduction in occupancy and equipment expenses as a result of lower equipment and software depreciation and charges 
payment and card processing expenses increased by  primarily reflecting the increased number of transaction accounts and increased customer usage of debit and credit cards 
all other expenses were only modestly changed from the prior year 
income taxes 
our normal  expected statutory income tax rate is  representing a blend of the statutory federal income tax rate of and apportioned effects of the oregon and idaho income tax rates of and  respectively 
however  because of adjustments to the valuation allowance for our net deferred tax asset  there was no provision for income taxes for the year ended december   although our pre tax net income was million 
for the year ended december   as a result of establishing the deferred tax valuation allowance  we recorded a net provision for income taxes of million which resulted in an effective tax rate of negative at december   the company had recorded a net deferred income tax asset of approximately million and current taxes receivable of million 
by june   the net deferred tax asset decreased slightly to million  while tax benefits for the first two quarters of increased our current taxes receivable to million 
during the third quarter of  it was determined that the company would provide a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax asset 
reasons for the determination included the negative evidence of three years of cumulative losses  the modest pace of economic recovery  and the continued difficulty in segments of the loan portfolio that put a near term return to profitability in question 
a valuation allowance was established during the third quarter of against the entire net deferred tax asset  reducing the balance  net of the allowance  to zero 
the valuation allowance was subsequently adjusted and will continue to be adjusted going forward for any changes in the net deferred tax asset  and the balance of our deferred tax asset  net of the allowance  will continue to remain at zero on our balance sheet for an indefinite period of time 
for more information on deferred taxes  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and despite generating a meaningful increase in revenues from our core operations  as a result of an elevated level of credit costs reflecting the continued weakness in the economy  ongoing strains in housing markets and further deterioration of property values  for the year ended december   we had a net loss of million 
after providing for the preferred stock dividend of million and related discount accretion of million  the net loss to common shareholders was million  or per diluted share 
this loss compared to a net loss to common shareholders of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  the pre tax loss for the year of million compared favorably with the pre tax loss in of million  as we experienced lower loan loss provisioning and an expanded net interest margin compared to the earlier year 
however  as a result of recording a full valuation adjustment against our net deferred tax asset  our provision for income taxes was million for the year ended december   compared to a net benefit from income taxes of million for the year ended december  as more fully explained below  our provision for loan losses was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year 
our net interest income for increased by million  or  to million  primarily because of a significant reduction in deposit costs  and was the most important component of the significant growth in revenues from core operations 
our operating results for the year ended december  also included a decrease in other operating income  which was particularly influenced by a lower million million after tax net gain as a result of changes in the valuation of financial instruments carried at fair value compared to a net gain of million million after tax for the prior year 
additionally  we recognized otti charges on certain investment securities of million for the year ended december   compared to million a year earlier 
excluding these fair value adjustments and otti charges  other operating income decreased only slightly to million for the year ended december  compared to million in  primarily as a result of decreased gains on the sale of loans from mortgage banking operations 
other operating expenses of million for the year ended december  increased from million for the prior year  primarily the result of higher collection costs and valuation allowances on reo which were partially offset by reduced costs for compensation  occupancy and deposit insurance expense 
compared to levels a year earlier  total assets decreased to billion at december   net loans decreased to billion  and deposits decreased to billion 
additionally  total borrowings including fhlb advances  retail repurchase agreements and junior subordinated debentures decreased million  or  to million while total stockholders equity increased by million 
the average balance of interest earning assets was billion for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  compared to billion one year earlier 
net interest income 
net interest income before provision for loan losses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million one year earlier  primarily as a result of the increase in the net interest margin and despite a modest decrease in average interest earning assets 
the net interest margin of for the year ended december  increased basis points from the prior year  largely as a result of the effect of a much lower cost of deposits which more than offset a decrease in asset yields 
our interest on loans during both years was adversely affected by a high level of nonaccrual loans and other non performing assets 
nonaccruing loans reduced the margin by basis points during the year ended december   a modest improvement compared to a basis point reduction for the prior year 
in addition  the mix of earning assets changed to include fewer loans and more securities and interest bearing deposits as our on balance sheet liquidity increased 
this shift in the mix in the very low interest rate environment had a further adverse effect on earning asset yields 
reflecting generally lower market interest rates as well as changes in asset mix  including a higher level of low yielding interest bearing deposits with banks  the yield on earning assets for the year ended december  decreased by basis points compared to the prior year 
more importantly  funding costs were also significantly lower  especially deposit costs which decreased basis points to from a year earlier  more than offsetting the decline in asset yields 
as a result  the net interest spread expanded to for the year ended december  compared to for the prior year and was only partially offset by the decline in average interest earning assets 
interest income 
interest income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the prior year  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in interest income occurred as a result of a million decrease in the average balance of interest earning assets  as well as a basis point decrease in the average yield on those assets 
the yield on average interest earning assets decreased to for the year ended december   compared to one year earlier  largely as a result of changes in the mix of assets and the impact of lower market rates on the securities portfolio 
federal reserve monetary policy actions during the year were designed to maintain short term market interest rates at the extremely low levels of the preceding two years and to move intermediate and longer term rates lower in despite the pressure from lower market interest rates  loan yields were nearly unchanged at for the year ended december  compared to in the preceding year primarily because of a decrease in the amount of non performing loans 
average loans receivable for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to billion  compared to billion for the prior year 
interest income on loans decreased by million  also  to million for the year from million for the year ended december   with very little impact from the two basis point decrease in the average yield on loans 
the combined average balance of mortgage backed securities  investment securities  daily interest bearing deposits and fhlb stock increased by million excluding the effect of fair value adjustments for the year ended december   while the interest and dividend income from those investments decreased by million compared to the prior year 
the effect of the increased average balance was more than offset as the average yield on the securities portfolio and cash equivalents decreased to for the year ended december   from one year earlier 
the basis point decrease in the yield on the securities portfolio which followed a basis decrease during is a reflection of the low interest rate environment as well as change in the mix of those assets  particularly the increase in daily interest bearing deposits 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the prior year  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in interest expense occurred as a result of a basis point decrease in the average cost of all interest bearing liabilities to for the year ended december   from one year earlier  and a million decrease in average interest bearing liabilities 
the decrease in average interest bearing balances reflected a modest increase in average deposits for the year that was more than offset by a decrease in average fhlb advances 
deposit interest expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year as a result of an basis point decrease in the cost of interest bearing deposits and despite an million increase in the average balance of deposits 
average deposit balances increased slightly to billion for the year ended december   from billion for the year ended december   while the average rate paid on deposit balances decreased to for the year from for the prior year 
deposit costs are significantly affected by changes in the level of market interest rates  however  changes in the average rate paid for interest bearing deposits tend to be less severe and to lag changes in market interest rates 
in addition  non interest bearing deposits dampen the effect of changes in market rates on our aggregate cost of deposits 
this lower degree of volatility and lag effect for deposit pricing was evident in both years in the decrease in deposit costs as the federal reserve pursued policies first to aggressively lower short term interest rates by basis points from september  to december  and subsequently to maintain the very low level of interest rates 
furthermore  competitive pricing pressure for interest bearing deposits was quite intense for certain earlier periods  as many financial institutions experienced increased liquidity concerns in the deteriorating economic conditions 
however  as market rates remained low for an extended period and competitors liquidity strains were generally mitigated  we experienced significantly declining deposit costs during and further  continued changes in our deposit mix  reflecting growth in lower cost transaction and savings accounts  also meaningfully contributed to the decrease in our funding costs 
average fhlb advances excluding the effect of fair value adjustments decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year 
the decline in outstanding fhlb advances resulted in a million decrease in the related interest expense as the average rate paid on fhlb advances remained virtually unchanged for the years ended december  and at and  respectively 
the average balance for other borrowings  consisting of customer retail repurchase agreements and senior bank notes  was million for the year ended december   an increase of  over the prior year  while the related interest expense for other borrowings increased by  to million for the year ended december   from million one year earlier 
the average rate paid on other borrowings increased basis points to for the year ended december   compared to one year earlier 
the increased average rate in reflected a change in the mix of average balances to include proportionally more of the senior bank notes in than in the senior bank notes were issued on march   have a fixed cost  including the fdic guarantee fee and the amortization of origination expenses  of and mature on march  junior subordinated debentures which were issued in connection with trust preferred securities had an average balance excluding the effect of fair value adjustments of million for both the years ended december  and the average rate decreased basis points between these periods to 
these junior subordinated debentures are adjustable rate instruments with repricing frequencies of three months based upon the three month libor index 
the lower average cost of the junior subordinated debentures in reflected the impact of lower short term market interest rates  particularly for periods in early compared to similar periods in provision and allowance for loan losses 
during the year ended december   the provision for loan losses was million  compared to million for the year ended december  for both years  the provision for loan losses was the most important factor contributing to our disappointing operating results 
while the provision for loan losses was significantly less in the year ended december  than in  it was still significantly above loss rates experienced prior to  primarily in response to the high levels of net charge offs throughout the year 
the provision for loan losses for the year ended december  continued to primarily reflect material levels of delinquent and non performing construction  land and land development loans for one to four family properties and additional declines in property values 
it also reflected our concerns that the significant number of distressed sellers in the market and additional expected lender foreclosures might further disrupt certain housing markets and adversely affect home prices and the demand for building lots 
these concerns heightened during the second half of and remained elevated as additional evidence of price declines for certain housing and related lot and land markets accumulated 
these concerns were further validated by appraisals of certain properties included in our portfolio of real estate acquired through foreclosure which led to the valuation adjustments noted in other parts of this report 
aside from housing related construction and development loans  non performing loans continued to generally reflect unique operating difficulties for the individual borrower  however  the weak pace of general economic activity also became a significant contributing factor to late cycle defaults in other non housing related segments of the portfolio 
we recorded net charge offs of million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year  and non performing loans decreased by million during the year to million at december   compared to million at december   the allowance for loan losses at december  showed a modest increase of million  or  to million  from million at december  however  with the decrease in loan balances  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans loans receivable excluding allowance for losses increased to at december   compared to at december  likewise  the allowance as a percentage of non performing loans increased to at december   compared to a year earlier 
as of december   we had identified million of impaired loans 
loans totaling million were subjected to a specific impairment analysis and of those loans  million were found to have no need for an allowance for credit losses as their estimated collateral value is equal to or exceeds their carrying costs  which in some cases is net of substantial write offs 
the remaining million of loans subjected to a specific impairment analysis were found to require allowances totaling million 
impaired loans that were collectively evaluated for reserve purposes within homogeneous pools totaled million and were found to require allowances totaling million 
the million evaluated for reserve purposes within homogeneous pools included million of restructured loans which were performing according to their restructured terms 
other operating income 
other operating income  which includes changes in the valuation of financial instruments carried at fair value as well as non interest revenues from core operations  decreased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year primarily due to a decline in favorable fair value adjustments and an increase in otti charges 
excluding the fair value adjustments and otti charges  other operating income from core operations decreased by the more modest million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year  primarily as a result of decreased mortgage banking activity 
the pace of mortgage banking activity was slowing down by the final quarter of  and for the full year  the activity was not as strong 
as a result  the gain on sale of loans decreased by million to million for the year ended december   compared to million in the prior year 
loan sales for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to million for the year ended december  by contrast  loan servicing fee income increased  compared to the prior year  reflecting an increase in the balance of loans serviced for others as well as an  valuation adjustment recorded in the previous year 
primarily as a result of growth in our customer base  income from deposit fees and other service charges increased by  or approximately  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year 
for the year ended december   we recorded a net gain of million for the change in valuation of financial instruments carried at fair value  compared to a net gain of million for the year ended december  the fair value adjustments in were largely centered in our trading and available for sale investment portfolios as a result of the impact of lower market interest rates on the valuation of certain fixed rate securities 
the adjustments in primarily reflected changes in the valuation of the junior subordinated debentures we have issued  which resulted in a large gain  partially offset by reductions in the values of the trust preferred securities which we own  including collateralized debt obligations secured by pools of trust preferred securities 
additionally  we experienced an increase in otti charges on certain trust preferred securities  which reduced income by million for the twelve months ended december   compared to charges of million for the same period one year earlier 
other operating expenses 
other operating expenses for the year ended december  totaled million compared to million in  an increase of million  or  compared to the prior year 
other operating expenses for reflected significantly higher expenses related to reo operations  including million of losses on sales and million of valuation adjustments on existing reo properties 
total reo expenses increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million a year earlier 
all other categories of expense  net  decreased only  salary and employee benefits decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily reflecting reduced staffing levels and lower commission expense for mortgage banking operations 
likewise  occupancy costs decreased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million one year earlier as we continued to achieve additional operating efficiencies in this important area following the successful multi year integration of our acquisitions 
operating expenses for the year ended december  also included million for deposit insurance  a decrease of million from the prior year that included a special assessment of million collected in june which did not recur in by contrast  the offset cost of capitalized loan origination costs decreased million as origination of certain loan types decreased during all other operating expenses  net  increased million  largely as a result of additional payment and card processing expenses reflecting increased customer activity and higher legal and insurance expenses 
income taxes 
our normal  expected statutory income tax rate is  representing a blend of the statutory federal income tax rate of and apportioned effects of the oregon and idaho income tax rates of and  respectively 
our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was a negative  which resulted from tax expense related to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance despite a pre tax loss 
for more information on deferred taxes  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended december   we had an effective tax rate of  which represented a tax benefit on our pre tax loss during that year 
in both years the effective tax rate reflected the recording of tax credits related to certain community reinvestment act investments combined with the tax benefits of tax exempt income from municipal securities and bank owned life insurance policies 
the impact of those tax credits and tax exempt income combined with the taxable loss in resulted in an effective tax rate that is somewhat higher than the expected statutory rate 
market risk and asset liability management our financial condition and operations are influenced significantly by general economic conditions  including the absolute level of interest rates as well as changes in interest rates and the slope of the yield curve 
our profitability is dependent to a large extent on our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest received from our interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred on our interest bearing liabilities 
our activities  like all financial institutions  inherently involve the assumption of interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the risk that changes in market interest rates will have an adverse impact on the institution s earnings and underlying economic value 
interest rate risk is determined by the maturity and repricing characteristics of an institution s assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
interest rate risk is measured by the variability of financial performance and economic value resulting from changes in interest rates 
interest rate risk is the primary market risk affecting our financial performance 
the greatest source of interest rate risk to us results from the mismatch of maturities or repricing intervals for rate sensitive assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
this mismatch or gap is generally characterized by a substantially shorter maturity structure for interest bearing liabilities than interest earning assets  although our floating rate assets tend to be more immediately responsive to changes in market rates than most funding deposit liabilities 
additional interest rate risk results from mismatched repricing indices and formulae basis risk and yield curve risk  and product caps and floors and early repayment or withdrawal provisions option risk  which may be contractual or market driven  that are generally more favorable to customers than to us 
an exception to this generalization is the beneficial effect of interest rate floors on a portion of our floating rate loans  which help us maintain higher loan yields in periods when market interest rates decline significantly 
however  in a declining interest rate environment  as loans with floors are repaid they generally are replaced with new loans which have lower interest rate floors 
further  many of the floating rate loans with interest rate floors are in portions of the portfolio currently experiencing higher levels of delinquencies  which tends to mitigate the beneficial effect of the floors 
as of december   our loans with interest rate floors totaled approximately billion and had a weighted average floor rate of 
an additional source of interest rate risk  which is currently of concern  is a prolonged period of exceptionally low market interest rates 
because interest bearing deposit costs have been reduced to nominal levels  there is very little possibility that they will be significantly further reduced 
by contrast  if market rates remain very low  loan and securities yields will likely continue to decline as longer term instruments mature or are repaid 
further  non interest bearing deposits provide a meaningful portion of our funding 
as a result  a prolonged period of very low interest rates will likely result in compression of our net interest margin 
while this pressure on the margin may be mitigated by further changes in the mix of assets and deposits  particularly increases in non interest bearing deposits  a prolonged period of low interest rates will present a very difficult operating environment for most banks 
the principal objectives of asset liability management are to evaluate the interest rate risk exposure  to determine the level of risk appropriate given our operating environment  business plan strategies  performance objectives  capital and liquidity constraints  and asset and liability allocation alternatives  and to manage our interest rate risk consistent with regulatory guidelines and policies approved by the board of directors 
through such management  we seek to reduce the vulnerability of our earnings and capital position to changes in the level of interest rates 
our actions in this regard are taken under the guidance of the asset liability management committee  which is comprised of members of our senior management 
the committee closely monitors our interest sensitivity exposure  asset and liability allocation decisions  liquidity and capital positions  and local and national economic conditions and attempts to structure the loan and investment portfolios and funding sources to maximize earnings within acceptable risk tolerances 
sensitivity analysis our primary monitoring tool for assessing interest rate risk is asset liability simulation modeling  which is designed to capture the dynamics of balance sheet  interest rate and spread movements and to quantify variations in net interest income resulting from those movements under different rate environments 
the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in the modeled interest rate environments provides a measurement of interest rate risk 
we also utilize economic value analysis  which addresses changes in estimated net economic value of equity arising from changes in the level of interest rates 
the net economic value of equity is estimated by separately valuing our assets and liabilities under varying interest rate environments 
the extent to which assets gain or lose value in relation to the gains or losses of liability values under the various interest rate assumptions determines the sensitivity of net economic value to changes in interest rates and provides an additional measure of interest rate risk 
the interest rate sensitivity analysis performed by us incorporates beginning of the period rate  balance and maturity data  using various levels of aggregation of that data  as well as certain assumptions concerning the maturity  repricing  amortization and prepayment characteristics of loans and other interest earning assets and the repricing and withdrawal of deposits and other interest bearing liabilities into an asset liability computer simulation model 
we update and prepare simulation modeling at least quarterly for review by senior management and the directors 
we believe the data and assumptions are realistic representations of our portfolio and possible outcomes under the various interest rate scenarios 
nonetheless  the interest rate sensitivity of our net interest income and net economic value of equity could vary substantially if different assumptions were used or if actual experience differs from the assumptions used 
the following table sets forth as of december  and  the estimated changes in our net interest income over a one year time horizon and the estimated changes in economic value of equity based on the indicated interest rate environments dollars in thousands 
table interest rate risk indicators december  estimated increase decrease in change in basis points in interest rates net interest income next months economic value of equity december  estimated increase decrease in change in basis points in interest rates net interest income next months economic value of equity assumes an instantaneous and sustained uniform change in market interest rates at all maturities  however  no rates are allowed to go below zero 
the current federal funds rate is 
another although less reliable monitoring tool for assessing interest rate risk is gap analysis 
the matching of the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which assets and liabilities are interest sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets anticipated  based upon certain assumptions  to mature or reprice within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities anticipated to mature or reprice  based upon certain assumptions  within that same time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest sensitive assets 
generally  during a period of rising rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
certain shortcomings are inherent in gap analysis 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as arm loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of some borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of a severe change in market rates 
table  interest sensitivity gap  presents our interest sensitivity gap between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  and the tables set forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which are anticipated by us  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future periods shown 
at december   total interest earning assets maturing or repricing within one year exceeded total interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing in the same time period by million  representing a one year cumulative gap to total assets ratio of 
management is aware of the sources of interest rate risk and in its opinion actively monitors and manages it to the extent possible 
the interest rate risk indicators and interest sensitivity gaps as of december  and are within our internal policy guidelines and management considers that our current level of interest rate risk is reasonable 
the following tables provide a gap analysis as of december  and dollars in thousands table interest sensitivity gap december  within months after months within year after year within years after years within years after years within years over years total interest earning assets construction loans fixed rate mortgage loans adjustable rate mortgage loans fixed rate mortgage backed securities adjustable rate mortgage backed securities fixed rate commercial agricultural loans adjustable rate commercial agricultural loans consumer and other loans investment securities and interest earning deposits total rate sensitive assets interest bearing liabilities regular savings and now accounts money market deposit accounts certificates of deposit fhlb advances other borrowings trust preferred securities retail repurchase agreements total rate sensitive liabilities excess deficiency of interest sensitive assets over interest sensitive liabilities cumulative excess deficiency of interest sensitive assets cumulative ratio of interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities interest sensitivity gap to total assets ratio of cumulative gap to total assets footnotes follow table interest sensitivity gap continued december  within months after months within year after year within years after years within years after years within years over years total interest earning assets construction loans fixed rate mortgage loans adjustable rate mortgage loans fixed rate mortgage backed securities adjustable rate mortgage backed securities fixed rate commercial agricultural loans adjustable rate commercial agricultural loans consumer and other loans investment securities and interest earning deposits total rate sensitive assets interest bearing liabilities regular savings and now accounts money market deposit accounts certificates of deposit fhlb advances other borrowings trust preferred securities retail repurchase agreements total rate sensitive liabilities excess deficiency of interest sensitive assets over interest sensitive liabilities cumulative excess deficiency of interest sensitive assets cumulative ratio of interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities interest sensitivity gap to total assets ratio of cumulative gap to total assets adjustable rate assets are included in the period in which interest rates are next scheduled to adjust rather than in the period in which they are due to mature  and fixed rate assets are included in the period in which they are scheduled to be repaid based upon scheduled amortization  in each case adjusted to take into account estimated prepayments 
mortgage loans and other loans are not reduced for allowances for loan losses and non performing loans 
mortgage loans  mortgage backed securities  other loans and investment securities are not adjusted for deferred fees and unamortized acquisition premiums and discounts 
adjustable rate liabilities are included in the period in which interest rates are next scheduled to adjust rather than in the period they are due to mature 
although regular savings  demand  now  and money market deposit accounts are subject to immediate withdrawal  based on historical experience management considers a substantial amount of such accounts to be core deposits having significantly longer maturities 
for the purpose of the gap analysis  these accounts have been assigned decay rates to reflect their longer effective maturities 
if all of these accounts had been assumed to be short term  the one year cumulative gap of interest sensitive assets would have been million  or of total assets at december   and million  or  at december  interest bearing liabilities for this table exclude certain non interest bearing deposits that are included in the average balance calculations reflected in table  analysis of net interest spread 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of funds are deposits  borrowings  proceeds from loan principal and interest payments and sales of loans  and the maturity of and interest income on mortgage backed and investment securities 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and mortgage backed securities are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates  economic conditions  competition and our pricing strategies 
our primary investing activity is the origination and purchase of loans 
during the years ended december   and  we purchased loans of million   and million  respectively  while loan originations  net of repayments  totaled million  million and million  respectively 
this activity was funded primarily by principal repayments on loans and securities and sales of loans 
during the years ended december   and  we sold million  million  and million  respectively  of loans 
during the years ended december  and  deposits declined by million and million  respectively  while we experienced net deposit growth of million for the year ended december  the decrease in deposits in the two most recent years was driven by our pricing decisions designed to shift our deposit portfolio into lower cost checking  savings and money market accounts  and allow higher rate certificates of deposit to run off 
additionally  during this period we reduced our reliance on both public funds and brokered deposits 
brokered deposits and public funds are generally more price sensitive than retail deposits and our use of those deposits varies significantly based upon our liquidity management strategies at any point in time 
fhlb advances excluding fair value adjustments decreased million and million  respectively  for the years ended december  and after increasing by million during the year ended december  other borrowings  including the million of senior bank notes issued under the tlgp and million of retail repurchase agreements  decreased million to million during the year ended december   following a decrease of million in and an increase of million in excluding fair value adjustments  our junior subordinated debentures were unchanged for each of the three years ended december  we must maintain an adequate level of liquidity to ensure the availability of sufficient funds to accommodate deposit withdrawals  to support loan growth  to satisfy financial commitments and to take advantage of investment opportunities 
during the years ended december   and  we used our sources of funds primarily to fund loan commitments  purchase securities  add to our short term liquidity position and pay maturing savings certificates and deposit withdrawals 
at december   we had outstanding loan commitments totaling million  including undisbursed loans in process and unused credit lines totaling million 
while representing potential growth in the loan portfolio and lending activities  this level of commitments is proportionally consistent with our historical experience and does not represent a departure from normal operations 
we generally maintain sufficient cash and readily marketable securities to meet short term liquidity needs  however  our primary liquidity management practice is to increase or decrease short term borrowings  including fhlb advances and federal reserve board borrowings 
we maintain credit facilities with the fhlb seattle  which at december  provide for advances that in the aggregate may equal the lesser of of banner bank s assets or adjusted qualifying collateral subject to a sufficient level of ownership of fhlb stock  up to a total possible credit line of million  and of islanders bank s assets or adjusted qualifying collateral  up to a total possible credit line of million 
advances under these credit facilities excluding fair value adjustments totaled million  or less than of our assets at december  in addition  banner bank has been approved for participation in the federal reserve bank s borrower in custody bic program 
under this program banner bank can borrow from up to of eligible loans  depending on collateral type and risk rating 
we currently estimate the federal reserve s bic program would provide additional borrowing capacity of million 
we had no funds borrowed from the federal reserve bank at december  or at december   certificates of deposit amounted to billion  or of our total deposits  including million which were scheduled to mature within one year 
certificates of deposit declined from of our total deposits at december   and of total deposits at december   reflecting our efforts to shift the portfolio mix into lower cost core deposits 
while no assurance can be given as to future periods  historically  we have been able to retain a significant amount of our deposits as they mature  although in and we intentionally encouraged certificates of deposit to decline 
management believes it has adequate resources and funding potential to meet our foreseeable liquidity requirements 
in addition to junior subordinated debentures  our capital base is primarily comprised of senior preferred stock  common stock and paid in capital  which were reduced by an accumulated deficit largely as a result of goodwill impairment charges recorded in in the year ended december   we received million when we issued senior preferred stock and a related warrant to the us treasury through its capital purchase program 
the senior preferred stock and warrant remained outstanding at december  during  the company completed a secondary offering of its common stock  resulting in net proceeds of million 
for additional information see notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
further  during the years ended december   and  we issued shares of common stock through our drip  which resulted in net proceeds of million  million and million  respectively 
the company has allocated a significant portion of the net proceeds from these capital raising activities to strengthen banner bank s regulatory capital ratios  however  at december   banner had retained million of cash at the holding company 
the company expects to use the remaining net proceeds for general working capital purposes  including additional capital investments in its subsidiary banks if appropriate and to support managed growth as economic conditions improve 
capital requirements banner corporation is a bank holding company registered with the federal reserve 
bank holding companies are subject to capital adequacy requirements of the federal reserve under the bank holding company act of  as amended bhca  and the regulations of the federal reserve 
banner bank and islanders bank  as state chartered  federally insured commercial banks  are subject to the capital requirements established by the fdic 
the capital adequacy requirements are quantitative measures established by regulation that require banner corporation and the banks to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of capital 
the federal reserve requires banner corporation to maintain capital adequacy that generally parallels the fdic requirements 
the fdic requires the banks to maintain minimum ratios of tier total capital to risk weighted assets as well as tier leverage capital to average assets 
in addition to these standard requirements  the bank mou also requires banner bank to maintain tier capital of not less than of banner bank s adjusted total assets 
at december   banner corporation and the banks each exceeded all current regulatory capital requirements 
see item  business regulation  and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding banner corporation s and banner bank s regulatory capital requirements

effect of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering the changes in relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary effect of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant effect on a financial institution s performance than do general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services
