item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and the notes thereto included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  organization of information management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes the following sections overview results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  liquidity and capital resources non gaap measures capital expenditures and outlook commitments and contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements critical accounting policies and estimates recently issued financial accounting standards overview on december   we completed the business combination of cambium and vlcy as contemplated by the agreement and plan of mergers  dated as of june   among us  vlcy  vowel acquisition corp  our wholly owned subsidiary  cambium  a wholly owned subsidiary of vss cambium holdings iii  llc  consonant acquisition corp  our wholly owned subsidiary  and vowel representative  llc  solely in its capacity as stockholders representative 
we refer to this agreement and plan of mergers in this report as the merger agreement 
pursuant to the merger agreement  we acquired all of the common stock of each of cambium and vlcy through the merger of consonant acquisition corp 
with and into cambium  with cambium continuing as the surviving corporation the cambium merger  and the concurrent merger of vowel acquisition corp 
with and into vlcy  with vlcy continuing as the surviving corporation the voyager merger 
as a result of the effectiveness of the mergers  cambium and vlcy became our wholly owned subsidiaries 
under the terms of the merger agreement  each outstanding share of vlcy s common stock was converted in the voyager merger into the right to receive at the election of each stockholder  either i in cash  without interest  or ii one share of our common stock  plus  regardless of the election made  additional consideration consisting of cash and a contingent value right  as described in the merger agreement 
the amount of cash available to satisfy cash elections by the vlcy stockholders was limited to million in the aggregate 
the cash consideration payable to the former vlcy stockholders was insufficient to accommodate all of the cash elections that were made 
accordingly  the amount of cash paid to the former vlcy stockholders who elected to exchange shares of vlcy common stock for cash was reduced  pro rata  in accordance with agreed procedures set forth in the merger agreement 
pursuant to these procedures  we paid million in cash to the former holders of vlcy s common stock and issued to those stockholders a total of million shares of common stock 
the cash consideration paid to the former vlcy stockholders consisted of million contributed by vss cambium holdings iii  llc and million contributed by vlcy 
in exchange for its contribution of million  vss cambium holdings iii  llc received million shares of our common stock issued at the ascribed value of per share 
the shares of cambium s common stock held by vss cambium holdings iii  llc  its sole stockholder  were converted in the cambium merger into the right to receive million shares of the our common stock 
in addition  as part of the merger consideration  vss cambium holdings iii  llc received a warrant to purchase a number of shares of our common stock determined by a formula set forth in the merger agreement  which is currently equal to million shares 
in connection with the consummation of this transaction  we entered into a stockholders agreement pursuant to which we granted vss cambium holdings iii  llc and funds managed and controlled by vss the right to purchase up to million shares of our common stock as provided for in the stockholders agreement as well as certain preemptive rights set forth therein 
in august  vss cambium holdings iii  llc  exercised its subscription rights in full to purchase  shares of our common stock  at a purchase price of per share  or an aggregate purchase price of million 
the merger transaction was accounted for as an acquisition of vlcy by cambium  as that term is used under gaap  for accounting and financial reporting purposes under the applicable accounting guidance for business combinations 
in making this determination  management considered that a the newly developed entity did not have any significant pre combination activity and  therefore  did not qualify to be the accounting acquirer  and b the former sole stockholder of cambium is the majority holder of the combined entity  while the prior owners of vlcy became minority holders in the combined entity 
as a result  the historical financial statements of cambium have become the historical financial statements of the company 
the results of vlcy are included in the company s operations beginning with the december  merger date  therefore  the financials include vlcy for the last days of that year and the results of the company for the full year 
prior to the merger transaction completed on december   we had two reportable segments published products and learning technologies 
subsequent to the merger transaction  we operate as three reportable segments with separate management teams and infrastructures that offer various products and services  as follows voyager  our comprehensive intervention business  sopris learning  our supplemental solutions education business  and cambium learning technologies clt  our technology based education product business 
unallocated shared services  such as accounting  legal  human resources and corporate related items  are recorded in a shared services category 
depreciation and amortization expense  interest income and expense  other income and expense  goodwill impairments  and taxes are included in this shared services category 
our historical segment reporting results have been adjusted for comparative purposes to reflect the current organizational structure 
these reclassifications required certain assumptions and estimates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our reportable segments 
also  as a result of the merger transaction and change in segments  we made a number of changes to personnel and processes as part of an overall departmental restructuring 
as certain functions were consolidated  some resources were shifted to other areas of the business 
in particular  some general and administrative functions were merged and  where appropriate  certain resources were shifted to customer facing functions  which are classified as cost of revenues 
these changes may affect comparability of pre merger and post merger periods 
results of operations highlights fiscal year in fiscal year  our voyager and sopris learning segments experienced order volume declines compared to the results of cambium and vlcy on a combined basis 
these declines were partially offset by order volume growth in our clt segment 
order volume is an internal metric of shipments of products and orders for online subscriptions or services and it serves as a leading indicator of net revenues 
the primary driver of order volume decline was the adverse conditions in the funding environment 
these adverse conditions included the elimination of reading first funding in and the depressed state of the state and local budgets that many school districts rely upon 
our customers and potential customers found it more challenging to secure adequate funding sources in the midst of these market conditions 
the american reinvestment and recovery act arra  which was passed in february and provided new federal funding for various education initiatives  helped offset some of the funding pressure 
in  we experienced success in securing orders that we believe were directly funded by arra  including several large multi year deals 
however  these orders were not enough to offset the overall decline 
our clt segment performed well in  as the market for online subscription based products such as those offered by our learning a z and explorelearning product lines remained strong  was less impacted by funding pressures and this segment benefited from strong selling and marketing execution 
we focused on our cost structure in  particularly on completing the integration related to our late merger with vlcy  and were successful in achieving significant cost savings and synergies through several initiatives including a reduction in force 
key areas of investment in included improved student data management systems  a separate dedicated sales force for sopris learning  development of an e commerce platform and continued investment in product development  sales and marketing for clt 
fiscal year in fiscal year  we experienced overall order volume declines driven by our voyager segment  partially offset by order volume growth in both the sopris learning and clt segments 
the adverse education funding environment impacted the voyager business unit to a greater degree than the company s other units 
the company believes that results were also adversely impacted by certain internal factors  such as decreased focus on the customer experience  an over reliance on the field sales force versus utilizing multiple channels of sales and marketing  and delays in strategic decision making 
the voyager segment experienced growth in the first half of  which we believe was at least partially attributable to some positive impact  both directly and indirectly  from arra funding and also due to growth in our service offerings 
however  the educational funding environment remained challenging and order volumes gained in the first half of the year were lost during the third quarter 
order volumes declined even further in the fourth quarter as most of the arra funding expired in september and several large multi year transactions completed in the fourth quarter of could not be replicated in as part of our strategy to grow through acquisitions  in october we completed the acquisition of class 
com 
class 
com provides high quality  research proven  online instruction  supplemental education  and intervention programs online and through its fully accredited high school  lna 
while the acquisition was completed too late in the fiscal year to be accretive in  we expect growth from the class 
com programs in our clt segment had another year of order volume growth  as the market acceptance for technology based solutions has been robust and appears less impacted by funding issues 
clt growth was also fueled by investments made in prior years for product development  sales and marketing 
within the clt segment we continued to experience significant growth in our two online offerings  explorelearning and learning a z 
this growth was partially offset by declines in the kurzweil and intellitools product lines 
our sopris learning segment also experienced year over year order volume growth  benefitting primarily from investments made in to develop a separate dedicated sales force  new and refreshed products and an e commerce platform 
expenses in benefitted from our cost savings initiatives 
we continued to pursue cost savings and productivity initiatives in  although not to the same extent as in  and we redeployed these savings into growth investments 
investments in were focused on our digital assets  including our student data management system  our online subscription products  new online adaptive solutions  and online intervention programs for math and literacy that will be released in we recorded goodwill impairment charges in of million related to our voyager segment and million related to a reporting unit in our clt segment that includes our kurzweil educational systems and intellitools product lines 
the goodwill impairment charges were primarily the result of the declines in order volumes and the expected near term impact of continued funding pressures on these two reporting units 
outlook for fiscal year while we believe the long term trends for education funding are positive  we anticipate an overall funding situation in similar to the conditions in based on the most recently submitted federal budgets  federal funding for title and idea were proposed at substantially the same level as however  it is likely that the expiration of arra funding in september will have some downward pressure on the overall funding available for schools  at least in the first half of when compared to the same period in race to the top  president obama s signature school reform program  has requested million under the budget proposal 
a large portion of that sum would go to early learning and focus on helping states and local districts support reforms and innovations to close achievement gaps and increase student achievement 
at the state and local funding level we expect challenges similar to as states continue to face fiscal challenges and constraints 
however  trends emerging from state governors reports indicate fewer and more modest anticipated declines in k education funding versus cuts in and while the funding environment continues to pose challenges  we are optimistic that the efficacy of our solutions  the need for our products in the education market  and our product diversification will strengthen our ability to sustain market share in a troubled market and  further  capture market share as the market recovers 
management expects to pursue the following activities in to encourage future revenue growth all segments will continue aggressive investments in technology enabled solutions 
we expect the technology solutions to focus especially on student directed learning as well as mastery based or competency based solutions 
we intend to increase investments in sales and marketing focused on our technology based solutions 
we plan to continue investments started in late in sales optimization via the application of a new customer relationship management crm system 
sopris learning will continue to partner with leading authors to develop new products and to digitize some of our current print based offerings 
voyager will change the pricing structure of certain of its core intervention offerings  providing greater price point flexibility to school districts and in some cases lowering the per student cost of implementing these solutions 
we are anticipating that the impact of such price reductions will be offset by higher student order volumes for the affected solutions 
voyager will continue to provide high quality services 
voyager s support services reinforce our commitment to partner with school districts to drive efficacy of our intervention solutions and the voyager education services group is the go to source for school wide improvement services 
we believe our focus on student outcomes through a blended model of print  technology and professional services  with an overall partnership approach with the customer to implement our solutions in the manner that the program was designed  results in higher student success rates 
such success  if achieved  will assist in customer retention and growth through reference sales 
voyager s class 
com offering and its fully accredited high school lna is expected to provide growth and serve as a key supplemental education partner with public schools 
voyager selling activities will be diversified to encompass multiple channels to market with less overall dependence on the field sales force 
such diversification includes increased ecommerce and inside sales resources 
additional investments in online and e marketing will increase the productivity of our sales  marketing and advertising efforts across all business segments 
we will continue our strategy to achieve growth through acquisitions  and in particular we will target technology centric  adaptive  student directed offerings 
we will embark on a series of new cost reductions and efficiency improvement activities in order to improve our earnings and to provide funding for many of the investment initiatives listed above 
in late  we launched a reengineering and restructuring initiative to align our organizational and cost structure to our strategic goals 
the financial goal of these actions is to provide savings to both improve earnings and to fund re investment in growth areas of the business 
severance costs of million were incurred in the fourth quarter of and the majority of the remaining costs are expected to be incurred in reengineering and restructuring activities will be assessed and enacted throughout and are expected to include obtaining new leadership and employee skill sets that support the transformation of our business to focus more heavily on technology solutions and services and other strategic objectives  outsourcing our warehouse operations to a third party logistics provider  which will allow us to take advantage of a lower and more variable cost structure for our print based products  as well as locate operations closer to the geographic center of our nationwide customer base  rationalizing our facilities space by consolidating facilities and subleasing or not renewing leases for entire or partial facilities where feasible  assessing and implementing projects to improve cost efficiencies and enhance the customer experience throughout the order to cash and service delivery processes  and other reductions as needed to improve our cost structure 
in february  we announced a plan to outsource our warehouse operations to a third party logistics provider  ohl  and to cease use of a leased facility in frederick  colorado that includes our warehouse and other office space 
warehouse operations in frederick are expected to be transferred to ohl and the facility be made available for sublease in the quarter ending june  we expect to incur approximately million to million in total expenses related to these exit activities 
of this amount  between million and million will be non cash impairment charges for the facility and warehouse related assets 
we also expect to incur between million and million in cash expenses associated with transferring inventory to ohl  preparing the facility for sublease  and one time employee termination benefits 
additionally  we expect to incur approximately million in capitalizable expenses associated with integrating our systems with ohl s 
these charges will predominantly be recorded in the quarters ending march  and june  aside from the outsourcing of warehouse operations and the million of severance incurred in  other one time costs for reengineering and restructuring activities are expected to range between and million 
approximately million to million of these charges are related to rationalizing facilities space  including both cash and non cash items 
in addition to the costs expected to be recorded in our statements of operations  we expect to spend approximately million to million on capital expenditures that support these other reengineering and restructuring efforts 
the total expense for all reengineering and restructuring initiatives from the fourth quarter of through the end of is expected to be between and million  including both cash and non cash items  and capital expenditures are expected to be between and million 
the targeted annual cash savings from all reengineering and restructuring activities is expected to range from to million annually by the above estimates of future reengineering and restructuring charges and cash expenditures represent our expectations or beliefs concerning various future events 
these expectations involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from current estimates 
the ultimate results of the reengineering and restructuring activities depend on a number of factors  including potential changes to the time and cost required for us to sublease facility space  the ultimate sublease rentals we receive for our facility space  the time and cost necessary to transfer inventory and begin logistics  transportation  and warehousing services through ohl  and whether  when and how successfully we enact other actions that could favorably impact our cost structure

the goodwill impairment charges were primarily the result of declines in order volumes in and the expected near term impact of continued funding pressures on these two reporting units 
although we believe that key federal and state funding programs will continue to encourage school districts to address the needs of at risk and special education students  we expect that governmental spending austerity and the challenging funding environment will continue in the short term

liquidity and capital resources because sales seasonality affects operating cash flow  we normally incur a net cash deficit from all of our activities through the early part of the third quarter of the year

we believe that earnings loss from operations before interest and other income expense  income taxes  and depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  and adjusted ebitda  which further excludes non recurring and non operational items  provide useful information for investors to assess the results of the ongoing business of the combined company 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not prepared in accordance with gaap and may be different from similarly named  non gaap financial measures used by other companies 
non gaap financial measures should not be considered a substitute for  or superior to  measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
we believe that adjusted ebitda provides useful information to investors because it reflects the underlying performance of the ongoing operations of the combined company and provides investors with a view of the combined company s operations from management s perspective 
adjusted ebitda removes significant one time or certain non cash items from earnings 
we use adjusted ebitda to monitor and evaluate the operating performance of the combined company and as the basis to set and measure progress towards performance targets  which directly affect compensation for employees and executives 
we generally use these non gaap measures as measures of operating performance and not as measures of liquidity 
our presentation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items

f under applicable accounting guidance for business combinations  an acquiring entity is required to recognize all of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition date fair value 
net revenues have been reduced by million and million  respectively  for the years ended december  and december  in the historical financial statements due to the write down of deferred revenue to its estimated fair value as of the merger date and in the pro forma adjustments to reflect the impact of the write down assuming the merger occurred on january  the write down was determined by estimating the cost to fulfill the related future customer obligations plus a normal profit margin 
partially offsetting this impact  cost of revenues and sales and marketing expenses were reduced for other purchase accounting adjustments  primarily a write down of deferred costs to zero at the acquisition date 
during the years ended december  and december   the historical cost of revenues was reduced by million and million  respectively  and the historical sales and marketing expenses were reduced by million and zero  respectively  and the related pro forma adjustments reflect the impact of the write down assuming the merger occurred on january  the adjustment of deferred revenue and deferred costs to fair value is required only at the purchase accounting date  therefore  its impact on net revenues  cost of revenues  and sales and marketing expense is non recurring

revenue recognition 
in october  new guidance was issued regarding multiple deliverable revenue arrangements and certain arrangements that include software elements 
this guidance requires entities to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of the delivered goods and services based on a selling price hierarchy 
the guidance eliminates the residual method of revenue allocation and requires revenue to be allocated using the relative selling price method 
in addition to requiring that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of an arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method  the guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable  which includes vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  if available  third party evidence tpe  if vsoe is not available  and best estimate of selling price besp  if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand alone basis 
it also removes tangible products from the scope of software revenue guidance and provides guidance on determining whether software deliverables in an arrangement that includes a tangible product are covered by the scope of the software revenue guidance 
effective january   we adopted this guidance on a prospective basis for all new or materially modified arrangements entered into after the adoption date 
revenues are derived from sales of reading  math and science  and professional service solutions to school districts primarily in the united states 
sales include printed materials  online educational content  courseware  training and implementation services  school improvement services and professional development 
revenue from the sale of printed materials is recognized when the product is shipped to or received by the customer  depending on the shipping terms of the arrangement 
revenue for online content  which may be sold separately or included with printed curriculum materials  courseware and school wide improvement services are recognized ratably over the subscription or contractual period  typically a school year 
professional services such as training  implementation and professional development are recognized over the period services are delivered 
explorelearning and learning a z derive revenue exclusively from sales of online subscriptions to their reading  math and science teaching websites and related training and professional development 
typically  the subscriptions are for a twelve to twenty four month period and the revenue is recognized ratably over the period the online access is available to the customer 
the division of revenue between printed materials  online materials  and ongoing support and services is determined in accordance with the accounting guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we are not able to establish vsoe for each of our deliverables 
whenever vsoe cannot be established  we review the offerings of our competitors to determine whether tpe can be established 
tpe is determined based on the prices charged by our competitors for a similar deliverable when sold separately 
it may be difficult for us to obtain sufficient information on competitor pricing to substantiate tpe and therefore we may not always be able to use tpe 
we also use besp to determine the selling price of certain of deliverables 
besp was primarily used for printed materials in the voyager segment  which have historically been priced on a bundled basis with the related online materials 
our determination of besp considers the anticipated margin on that deliverable  the selling price and profit margin for similar parts or services  and our ongoing pricing strategy and policies 
we plan to analyze the selling prices used in the allocation of arrangement consideration at least annually 
selling prices will be analyzed on a more frequent basis if a significant change in our business necessitates a more timely analysis or if we experience significant variances in our selling prices 
our software products often include maintenance  support or on line services 
maintenance and support services include telephone support  bug fixes  and  for certain products  rights to upgrades and enhancements on a when and if available basis 
on line services include storage  assignment  scoring and reporting 
these services are recognized on a straight line basis over the period they are provided 
revenues under multiple element software license arrangements  which may include several different software products and services sold together  are allocated to each element based on the residual method in accordance with accounting guidance for software revenue recognition 
in certain instances  telephone support and software repairs are provided for free within the first year of licensing the software 
the cost of providing this service is insignificant  and is accrued at the time of revenue recognition 
we enter into agreements to license certain publishing rights and content 
we recognize the revenue from these agreements when the license amount is fixed and determinable  collection is reasonably assured  and the license period has commenced 
for those license agreements that require us to deliver additional materials as part of the license agreement  the revenue is recognized when the product is received by the customer 
shipments to school book depositories are on consignment and revenue is recognized based on shipments from the depositories to the schools 
impairment of goodwill 
we review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually 
the annual analysis is performed as of december or when certain triggering events occur 
the applicable accounting guidance requires that a two step impairment test be performed on goodwill 
in the first step  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of that unit  goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of that unit  then a second step must be performed to determine the implied fair value of the reporting entity s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then an impairment loss equal to the difference is recorded 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature  and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions may include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions  and determination of appropriate market comparables 
in addition  we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values of our reporting units 
we performed the yearend impairment analysis using four reporting units voyager  sopris learning  the learning a z and explorelearning product lines from the clt segment lazel  and the kurzweil and intellitools product lines from the clt segment ki 
the following table details the goodwill balance by reporting unit at december  september  goodwill balance as of december  voyager sopris learning lazel ki total in the first step of the impairment test for fiscal year  the fair market value of each reporting unit was determined using a weighted income and market approach 
the income approach was dependent on multiple assumptions and estimates  including future cash flow projections with a terminal value multiple and the discount rate used to determine the expected present value of the estimated future cash flows 
future cash flow projections were based on management s best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period  including industry fundamentals such as the state of educational funding  revenue growth rates  future costs and operating margins  working capital needs  capital and other expenditures  and tax rates 
the discount rate applied to the future cash flows was a weighted average cost of capital and took into consideration market and industry conditions  returns for comparable companies  the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn  and other relevant factors 
the fair values of each reporting unit also took into consideration a market approach  based on historical and projected multiples of certain guideline companies 
the first step of impairment testing for fiscal showed that the carrying value of the voyager and ki reporting units exceeded their respective fair values and that the second step of testing was required 
the calculated fair values of each of the other reporting units exceeded their carrying values by at least  therefore  no second step of testing was required 
the second step requires the allocation of the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
as a result of the second step of our fiscal impairment test  the goodwill balances for the voyager and ki reporting units were determined to be partially impaired  and impairment charges of million and million  respectively  were recorded as of december  the goodwill impairment charges were primarily the result of declines in order volumes in and the expected near term impact of continued funding pressures on these two reporting units 
although we believe that key federal and state funding programs will continue to encourage school districts to address the needs of at risk and special education students  we expect that governmental spending austerity and the challenging educational funding environment will continue in the short term 
although management has included its best estimates of the impact of these and other factors in our cash flow projections  the projection of future cash flows is inherently uncertain and requires a significant amount of judgment 
actual results that are significantly different than these cash flow projections or a change in the discount rate could significantly affect the fair value estimates used to value our reporting units in step one of the goodwill analysis or the fair values of our other asset and liability balances used in step two of the goodwill analysis  and could result in future goodwill impairments 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review the carrying value of long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate net book value may not be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
if our review indicates any assets are impaired  the impairment of those assets is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value as estimated by discounted cash flows 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost of disposal 
for fiscal year  no impairment was indicated 
the determination whether our definite lived intangible assets are impaired involves significant assumptions and estimates  including projections of future cash flows  the percentage of future revenues and cash flows attributable to the intangible assets  asset lives used to generate future cash flows  and royalty charges attributable to trademarks 
the impairment calculations are most sensitive to the future cash flow assumptions 
future cash flow projections are based on management s best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period  including industry fundamentals such as the state of educational funding  revenue growth rates  future costs and operating margins  working capital needs  and capital and other expenditures 
the adverse conditions in the education funding environment have affected our operations during and may continue to have an impact  and potentially increase the impact  on our future revenues  profits  cash flows and carrying value of assets 
pre publication costs 
we capitalize certain pre publication costs of our curriculum  including art  prepress  editorial  and other costs incurred in the creation of the master copy of our curriculum products 
pre publication costs are amortized over the expected life of the education program  generally on an accelerated basis over a period of five years 
the amortization methods and periods chosen reflect the expected revenues generated by the education programs 
we periodically review the recoverability of the capitalized costs based on expected net realizable value 
accounts receivable 
accounts receivable are stated net of allowances for doubtful accounts and estimated sales returns 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on a review of the outstanding balances and historical collection experience 
the reserve for sales returns is based on historical rates of returns as well as other factors that in our judgment could reasonably be expected to cause sales returns to differ from historical experience 
actual bad debt write offs and returns could differ from our estimates 
inventory 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost  determined using the first in  first out fifo method  or market  and consists of finished goods 
we reduce slow moving or obsolete inventory to net realizable value 
inventory values are maintained at an amount that management considers appropriate based on factors such as the inventory aging  historical usage of the product  future sales forecasts  and product development plans 
these factors involve management s judgment and changes in estimates could result in increases or decreases to the inventory values 
the impact of a one percentage point change in the amount of inventory considered to be excess or obsolete would have resulted in an increase or decrease in cost of revenues of approximately million for the year ended december  inventory values are reviewed on a periodic basis 
income taxes 
provision is made for the expense  or benefit  associated with taxes based on income 
the provision for income taxes is based on laws currently enacted in every jurisdiction in which we do business and considers laws mitigating the taxation of the same income by more than one jurisdiction 
significant judgment is required in determining income tax expense  current tax receivables and payables  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and valuation allowance recorded against the net deferred tax assets 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  taxable income in prior carryback years  loss carryforward limitations  and tax planning strategies in assessing whether deferred tax assets will be realized in future periods 
if  after consideration of these factors  management believes it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance is established 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be reduced if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate these amounts  since this requires management to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we reevaluate our uncertain tax positions on a periodic basis  based on factors such as changes in facts and circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity 
contingent value rights cvrs 
cvrs were issued to vlcy stockholders as part of the merger 
each cvr represents the right to receive a cash amount equal to the sum of the following amounts minus specified agreed upon liabilities  including agreed contingencies  potential working capital adjustments and expenses of the stockholders representative under the merger agreement specified vlcy tax refunds received after the effective time of the merger  plus the lesser of million or the amount of specified post signing tax refunds of vlcy received after the date of the merger agreement and on or prior to the date of the closing  which was million  plus a portion of funds held for a potential tax indemnity obligation  if such obligation is not paid to its beneficiary  plus other amounts specified in the escrow agreement  divided by the total number of shares of vlcy common stock outstanding as of the effective time of the merger 
the fair value of the liability for the cvrs is determined using a probability weighted cash flow analysis which takes into consideration the likelihood  amount and timing of cash flows of each element of the pool of assets and liabilities included in the cvr 
the determination of fair value of the cvrs involves significant assumptions and estimates  which are reviewed at each quarterly reporting date 
during  a loss of million was recorded in general and administrative expense to reflect an increase in the estimated fair value of the cvr liability 
as of december   a fair value of million has been recorded as a liability for the remaining cvr payments 
the ultimate value of the remaining cvr payments is not known at this time  however  it could range from zero to a maximum possible value of approximately million 
future changes in the estimate of the fair value of the cvrs will impact results of operations and could be material 
as of december   restricted assets in an escrow account for the benefit of the cvrs were million 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information on the fair value of the cvrs and related escrow trust 
the first and second cvr payment dates were in september and june  with million and million  respectively  distributed to the escrow agent at those times for distribution to holders of the cvrs 
the next scheduled distribution  if any  will be made no later than october and relates to a potential tax indemnity obligation 
additionally  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements  any amounts due to cvr holders as a result of refunds received related to the michigan tax payment will be distributed upon the final resolution of this agreed contingency 
other contingencies 
other contingencies are recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and the value can be reasonably estimated 
the company had a potential indemnification liability related to state income taxes and related interest that had been assessed against pqil 
on august   pqil received a decision and order of determination from the michigan taxing authority 
according to the determination of the michigan taxing authority  pqil was liable to the state of michigan for unpaid taxes and interest in the amount of approximately million 
in order to expedite resolution of this matter and access the michigan court of claims  the company paid this indemnification liability to the state of michigan on behalf of pqil on september  and filed an action in the michigan court of claims to pursue a refund of the assessment 
on november   the court of claims in michigan ruled in favor of the company s motion for summary judgment 
the michigan state taxing authority has since appealed the decision of the court of claims to the michigan court of appeals 
as management believes it is more likely than not that the company s position will ultimately be upheld  a tax receivable for the expected refund plus statutory interest is recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets totaling million and million as of december  and  respectively 
this indemnification liability was identified as an agreed contingency for purposes of the cvrs issued as part of the vlcy merger consideration 
in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement  dated june   fifty percent of any amount that is paid or due and payable with respect to each agreed contingency would offset payments due under the cvrs from an amount held for such payments by wells fargo bank  na  as escrow agent  in an escrow account 
upon payment of the approximately million  the company requested a disbursement to the company from the escrow account in an amount equal to fifty percent of the payment  or approximately million 
this cash disbursement was received by the company during the third quarter of on september   the company amended the merger agreement and the escrow agreement to extend the term of the escrow agreement until the later of the full distribution of the escrow funds or the final resolution of the agreed contingency 
the final resolution of the tax litigation or potential settlement could result in a total refund from the taxing authority to the company ranging from zero to approximately million as of december   and of any such refund would in turn be payable to the holders of the cvrs 
as of december   the company has recorded million as a component of the cvr liability related to this agreed upon contingency  which is an estimate of the fair value based on a probability weighted cash flow analysis using management assumptions related to the likelihood of the ultimate cash outflows 
if pqil s position is not ultimately upheld  the company could incur non cash charges of up to million of indemnification expense and a million reduction in interest income in future periods on its statements of operations  partially offset by the related million reduction to the cvrs liability 
the court of claims in michigan also ruled in the company s favor on two other tax matters that could result in a refund of up to million  plus statutory interest 
these potential tax refunds would be retained by the company and are not subject to payment to the holders of the cvrs
