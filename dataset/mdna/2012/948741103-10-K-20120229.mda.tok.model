item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the comparative summary of selected financial data appearing elsewhere in this report 
historical results and trends which might appear should not be taken as indicative of future operations 
our results of operations and financial condition  as reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes  are subject to management s evaluation and interpretation of business conditions  retailer performance  changing capital market conditions and other factors which could affect the ongoing viability of our tenants 
executive overview weingarten realty investors is a reit organized under the texas business organizations code 
we  and our predecessor entity  began the ownership and development of shopping centers and other commercial real estate in our primary business is leasing space to tenants in the shopping and industrial centers we own or lease 
we also manage centers for joint ventures in which we are partners or for other outside owners for which we charge fees 
we operate a portfolio of rental properties which includes neighborhood and community shopping centers and industrial properties that total approximately million square feet 
we have a diversified tenant base with our largest tenant comprising only of total rental revenues during our long term strategy is to focus on improving our core operations and increasing shareholder value 
we accomplish this through hands on leasing and management  selective redevelopment of the existing portfolio of properties  disciplined growth from strategic acquisitions and new developments  as well as dispositions of assets that no longer meet our ownership criteria 
we remain committed to maintaining a conservatively leveraged balance sheet  a well staggered debt maturity schedule and strong credit agency ratings 
during  we announced our intentions to dispose of over million of non core operating properties over the next few years  which will recycle capital for growth opportunities  strengthen our operating fundamentals and allow for further deleveraging of our balance sheet 
in the course of executing this disposition plan  given proper pricing  we will consider selling both retail and industrial properties 
to date  we have successfully disposed of million  either directly or through our interest in real estate joint ventures or partnerships  and have approximately million currently under contracts or letters of intent 
upon the completion of this program  we believe our remaining portfolio of properties will be among the strongest in our sector 
improvements in the economy earlier in reopened markets to create more favorable pricing for dispositions 
however  the federal debt ceiling crisis and volatility in greece and other european markets have resulted in deteriorated market conditions and access to the cmbs debt markets for potential purchasers 
despite these conditions  we continue to believe we will successfully execute our disposition plan  although continued weakness in the cmbs debt markets and further worsening of the economy could impact our ability to execute this plan 
nonetheless  competition for quality acquisition opportunities remains substantial 
during  we were successful in identifying selected properties that met our return hurdles  and we will continue to actively evaluate other opportunities as they enter the market 
we strive to maintain a strong  conservative capital structure which provides ready access to a variety of attractive long and short term capital sources 
we carefully balance obtaining low cost financing while matching long term liabilities associated with acquired or developed long term assets 
an amendment and extension of our revolving credit facility during enhances our liquidity for the next four years and provides favorable borrowing rates at a margin over libor 
while the availability of capital has improved over the past year  there can be no assurance that such pricing and availability will not deteriorate in the future 
at december   we owned or operated under long term leases  either directly or through our interest in real estate joint ventures or partnerships  a total of developed income producing properties and properties under various stages of construction and development 
the total number of centers includes neighborhood and community shopping centers  industrial projects and three other operating properties located in states spanning the country from coast to coast 

table of contents we also owned interests in parcels of land held for development that totaled approximately million square feet 
we had approximately  leases with  different tenants at december  leases for our properties range from less than a year for smaller spaces to over years for larger tenants 
rental revenues generally include minimum lease payments  which often increase over the lease term  reimbursements of property operating expenses  including real estate taxes  and additional rent payments based on a percentage of the tenants sales 
the majority of our anchor tenants are supermarkets  value oriented apparel discount stores and other retailers or service providers who generally sell basic necessity type goods and services 
through this challenging economic environment  we believe the stability of our anchor tenants  combined with convenient locations  attractive and well maintained properties  high quality retailers and a strong tenant mix  should ensure the long term success of our merchants and the viability of our portfolio 
in assessing the performance of our properties  management carefully monitors various operating metrics of the portfolio 
occupancy for the total portfolio increased from at december  to at december  while we will continue to monitor the economy and the effects on our tenants  we believe the significant diversification of our portfolio  both geographically and by tenant base  and the quality of our portfolio will allow us to maintain occupancy levels at or above these levels as we move through  assuming no bankruptcies by multiple national or regional tenants 
soft economic conditions contributed to a slight decrease in rental rates on a same space basis as we completed new leases and renewed existing leases 
we completed  new leases or renewals during  totaling million square feet  which decreased rental rates an average of 
on a cash basis 
while we continue to see some strengthening in our renewal rates  new lease rates continue to be a challenge 
although we believe the gap in the new lease rate margins will not continue to widen  they are expected to remain a challenge throughout new development at december   we had properties in various stages of construction and development  including three newly acquired projects located in florida  georgia and virginia  which upon completion will represent an estimated total investment of million 
we have funded million to date on these projects  and we estimate our investment upon completion to be million  after consideration of proceeds from anticipated land sales and tax incentive financing which is estimated to be million 
overall  the average projected return on investment for these properties is approximately upon projected completion 
in november  we formed a real estate joint venture to develop a shopping center in alexandria  virginia 
this development will include  square feet of retail space and is anchored by a  square foot supermarket 
this project will represent an investment of approximately million upon completion and provides us with our entry into the dynamic washington  dc market 
we have approximately million in land held for development at december  due to our analysis of current economic considerations  including the effects of recent market transactions and negotiations with potential buyers  we recognized an impairment charge of million for the year ended december  even with the unrest in the overall economy  we continue to see an increase in development and redevelopment opportunities entering the market  which we are selectively pursuing 
within this portfolio  we have experienced greater levels of interest compared to recent years in our land held for development from retailers and other market participants 
also  certain tracts of land have been designated for transition to land under development as additional phases of existing developments become feasible 
acquisitions and joint ventures acquisitions are a key component of our long term strategy 
the availability of quality acquisition opportunities in the market remains sporadic 
competition for the highest quality core properties is intense which has in many cases driven pricing to pre recession highs 
we remain disciplined in approaching these opportunities  pursuing only those that provide appropriate risk adjusted returns 
the use of joint venture arrangements is another facet of our long term strategy 
partnering with institutional investors through real estate joint ventures enables us to acquire high quality assets in our target markets while also meeting our financial return objectives 
under these arrangements  we benefit from access to lower cost capital  as well as leveraging our expertise to provide fee based services  such as acquisition  leasing  property management and asset management  to the joint ventures 

table of contents an analysis of our equity method investments in real estate joint ventures and partnerships resulted in an impairment charge of million for the year ended december  based on current market conditions 
we continue to monitor our joint venture relationships and evaluate whether new or existing relationships could provide equity for new investments 
fee income from joint venture and third party managed operations for the year ended december   and was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
this fee income is based upon revenues  net income and in some cases appraised property values 
in  we anticipate these fees will be consistent with our performance 
dispositions dispositions are also a key component of our ongoing management process where we selectively prune properties from our portfolio that no longer meet our geographic or growth targets 
dispositions provide capital  which may be recycled into properties that have high barrier to entry locations within high growth metropolitan markets  and thus have higher long term growth potential 
additionally  proceeds from dispositions may be used to reduce outstanding debt  further deleveraging our balance sheet 
over time  we expect this will produce a portfolio with higher occupancy rates and stronger internal revenue growth 
during  we announced a strategic initiative to dispose of over million of non core operating properties over the next few years 
in the course of executing this disposition plan  given proper pricing  we will consider selling both retail and industrial properties 
our disposition program may be impacted by market pricing conditions and debt financing available to prospective purchasers 
after specifically identifying potential disposition properties and analyzing current market data  we recognized an impairment charge of million for the year ended december  on the properties we believe we are likely to sell as part of this initiative or properties that have been sold during summary of critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
real estate joint ventures and partnerships to determine the method of accounting for partially owned real estate joint ventures and partnerships  management evaluates the characteristics of associated entities and determines whether an entity is a variable interest entity vie and  if so  determines which party is the primary beneficiary by analyzing whether we have both the power to direct the entity s significant economic activities and the obligation to absorb potentially significant losses or receive potentially significant benefits 
significant judgments and assumptions inherent in this analysis include the nature of the entity s operations  future cash flow projections  the entity s financing and capital structure  and contractual relationships and terms 
we consolidate a vie when we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary 
primary risks associated with our vies include the potential of funding the entities debt obligations or making additional contributions to fund the entities operations 
partially owned  non variable interest real estate joint ventures and partnerships over which we have a controlling financial interest are consolidated in our consolidated financial statements 
in determining if we have a controlling financial interest  we consider factors such as ownership interest  authority to make decisions  kick out rights and substantive participating rights 
partially owned real estate joint ventures and partnerships where we do not have a controlling financial interest  but have the ability to exercise significant influence  are accounted for using the equity method 

table of contents management continually analyzes and assesses reconsideration events  including changes in the factors mentioned above  to determine if the consolidation treatment remains appropriate 
decisions regarding consolidation of partially owned entities frequently require significant judgment by our management 
errors in the assessment of consolidation could result in material changes to our consolidated financial statements 
property acquisitions of properties are accounted for utilizing the acquisition method and  accordingly  the results of operations of an acquired property are included in our results of operations from the date of acquisition 
estimates of fair values are based upon future cash flows and other valuation techniques in accordance with our fair value measurements accounting policy 
fair values are used to record the purchase price of acquired property among land  buildings on an as if vacant basis  tenant improvements  other identifiable intangibles and any goodwill or gain on purchase 
other identifiable intangible assets and liabilities include the effect of out of market leases  the value of having leases in place as is versus as if vacant and absorption costs  out of market assumed mortgages and tenant relationships 
depreciation and amortization is computed using the straight line method  generally over estimated useful lives of years for buildings and over the lease term which includes bargain renewal options for other identifiable intangible assets 
the impact of these estimates  including incorrect estimates in connection with acquisition values and estimated useful lives  could result in significant differences related to the purchased assets  liabilities and resulting depreciation or amortization 
acquisition costs are expensed as incurred 
impairment our property is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the property  including any capitalized costs and any identifiable intangible assets  may not be recoverable 
if such an event occurs  a comparison is made of the current and projected operating cash flows of each such property into the foreseeable future  with consideration of applicable holding periods  on an undiscounted basis to the carrying amount of such property 
if we determine the carrying amount is not recoverable  our basis in the property is reduced to its estimated fair value to reflect impairment in the value of the asset 
fair values are determined by management utilizing cash flow models  market capitalization and discount rates  or by obtaining third party broker or appraisal estimates in accordance with our fair value measurements accounting policy 
we review current economic considerations each reporting period  including the effects of tenant bankruptcies  the suspension of tenant expansion plans for new development projects  declines in real estate values and any changes to plans related to our new development projects including land held for development  to identify properties where we believe market values may be deteriorating 
determining whether a property is impaired and  if impaired  the amount of write down to fair value requires a significant amount of judgment by management and is based on the best information available to management at the time of evaluation 
the evaluations used in these analyses could result in incorrect estimates when determining carrying values that could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
our investment in partially owned real estate joint ventures and partnerships is reviewed for impairment each reporting period 
the ultimate realization is dependent on a number of factors  including the performance of each investment and market conditions 
we will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the estimated fair value of an investment below its carrying amount is other than temporary 
a considerable amount of judgment by our management is used in this evaluation 
our overall future plans for the investment  our investment partner s financial outlook and our views on current market and economic conditions may have a significant impact on the resulting factors analyzed for these purposes 
our investments in tax increment revenue bonds are reviewed for impairment  including the evaluation of changes in events or circumstances that may indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable 
realization is dependent on a number of factors  including investment performance  market conditions and payment structure 
we will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the value of the investment below its carrying amount is other than temporary  recovery of its cost basis is uncertain  and or it is uncertain if the investment will be held to maturity 
a considerable amount of judgment by our management is used in this evaluation  which may produce incorrect estimates that could be material to our consolidated financial statements

this decrease is attributable to decreases in net rental revenues and other income of million and million  respectively 
the decrease in net rental revenues was primarily attributable to an aggregate million reduction from the sale of an interest in six shopping centers

gain on sale of property the decrease in gain on sale of property of million is attributable primarily to gains in from the sale of an interest in four shopping centers and the disposition of retail buildings at seven operating properties 
the sales activities in were not significant 
effects of inflation we have structured our leases in such a way as to remain largely unaffected should significant inflation occur 
most of the leases contain percentage rent provisions whereby we receive increased rentals based on the tenants gross sales 
many leases provide for increasing minimum rentals during the terms of the leases through escalation provisions 
in addition  many of our leases are for terms of less than years  which allow us to adjust rental rates to changing market conditions when the leases expire 
most of our leases also require the tenants to pay their proportionate share of operating expenses and real estate taxes 
as a result of these lease provisions  increases due to inflation  as well as real estate tax rate increases  generally do not have a significant adverse effect upon our operating results as they are absorbed by our tenants 
under the current economic climate  little to no inflation is occurring 
capital resources and liquidity our primary liquidity needs are paying our common and preferred dividends  maintaining and operating our existing properties  paying our debt service costs  excluding debt maturities  and funding capital expenditures 
under our business plan  cash flows from operating activities are expected to meet these planned capital needs 
the primary sources of capital for funding any debt maturities and acquisitions are our revolving credit facility  proceeds from both secured and unsecured debt issuances  proceeds from common and preferred equity issuances  cash generated from the sale of property and the formation of joint ventures  and cash flow generated by our operating properties 
amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility are retired as needed with proceeds from the issuance of long term debt  common and preferred equity  cash generated from the disposition of properties and cash flow generated by our operating properties 
during  we paid off our fixed rate unsecured notes totaling million and redeemed million of our convertible senior unsecured notes using our revolving credit facility 
in addition  we entered into a one year term loan in the amount of million at a borrowing rate that floats at a margin over libor 
loan proceeds were used to pay down amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility 

table of contents effective september   we entered into an amended and restated million unsecured revolving credit facility 
the facility expires in september  provides for a one year extension upon request and provides borrowing rates that float at a margin over libor plus a facility fee 
the borrowing margin and facility fee are priced off a grid that is tied to our senior unsecured credit ratings  which are currently and basis points  respectively 
this results in a decrease of basis points in the borrowing margin from the previous margin of basis points and a decrease of basis points in the facility fee  substantially reducing our cost of borrowing 
as of december   we had million outstanding under our million revolving credit facility and million was outstanding under our million credit facility  which we use for cash management purposes 
we believe proceeds from our disposition program for  combined with our available capacity under the revolving credit facilities  will provide adequate liquidity to fund our capital needs 
in the event our disposition program does not progress as expected  we believe other debt and equity alternatives are available to us 
although external market conditions are not within our control  we do not currently foresee any reasons that would prevent us from entering the capital markets 
our most restrictive debt covenants  including debt to assets  secured debt to assets  fixed charge and unencumbered interest coverage and debt yield ratios  limit the amount of additional leverage we can add  however  we believe the sources of capital described above are adequate to execute our business strategy and remain in compliance with our debt covenants 
we have non recourse debt secured by acquired or developed properties held in several of our real estate joint ventures and partnerships 
off balance sheet mortgage debt for our unconsolidated real estate joint ventures and partnerships totaled million  of which our ownership percentage is million at december  scheduled principal mortgage payments on this debt  excluding non cash related items totaling million  at are as follows in millions thereafter total we hedge the future cash flows of certain debt transactions  as well as changes in the fair value of our debt instruments  principally through interest rate contracts with major financial institutions 
we generally have the right to sell or otherwise dispose of our assets except in certain cases where we are required to obtain our joint venture partners consent or a third party consent for assets held in special purpose entities  which are owned by us 
investing activities acquisitions and joint ventures during  we acquired two shopping centers for approximately million 
in april  we acquired a owned unconsolidated real estate joint venture interest in three retail properties for approximately million and purchased our partner s unconsolidated interest in a property for million  which included their share of a construction note obligation 
dispositions during  we sold eight retail properties  three industrial properties  a retail building and undeveloped land parcels with aggregate gross sales proceeds of million  which generated a gain of million 
also  an unconsolidated real estate joint venture sold two industrial buildings with gross sales proceeds aggregating million  which did not generate a gain 

table of contents new development and capital expenditures at december   we had projects under various stages of construction and development with a total square footage of approximately million  including three newly acquired projects located in florida  georgia and virginia  which upon completion will represent an estimated total investment of million 
overall  we expect our investment in these properties upon completion to be million  net of future proceeds from land sales and tax incentive financing of million 
in november  we formed a real estate joint venture to develop a shopping center in alexandria  virginia 
this development will include  square feet of retail space and is anchored by a  square foot supermarket 
this project will represent an investment of approximately million upon completion and provides us with our entry into the dynamic washington  dc market 
our new development projects are financed initially under our revolving credit facility  as it is our practice not to use third party construction financing 
management monitors amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and periodically pays down such balances using cash generated from operations  from both secured and unsecured debt issuances  from common and preferred share issuances and from dispositions of properties 
capital expenditures for additions to the existing portfolio  acquisitions  new development and our share of investments in unconsolidated real estate joint ventures and partnerships totaled million in  million in and million in we have entered into commitments aggregating million comprised principally of construction contracts which are generally due in to months

total debt at december   included billion on which interest rates are fixed and million  including the effect of million of interest rate contracts  which bears interest at variable rates 
additionally  of our total debt  billion was secured by operating properties while the remaining billion was unsecured 
we have a million unsecured revolving credit facility  which expires in september and provides borrowing rates that float at a margin over libor plus a facility fee 
the borrowing margin and facility fee are priced off a grid that is tied to our senior unsecured credit ratings  which are currently and basis points  respectively 
the facility also contains a competitive bid feature that will allow us to request bids for up to million 
additionally  an accordion feature allows us to increase the facility amount up to million 
as of february   we had million outstanding  and the available balance was million  net of million in outstanding letters of credit 
we also have an agreement with a bank for an unsecured and uncommitted overnight facility totaling million that we maintain for cash management purposes 
the facility provides for fixed interest rate loans at a day libor rate plus a borrowing margin based on market liquidity 
as of february   million was outstanding under this facility  and the available balance was million 
during  the maximum balance and weighted average balance outstanding under both facilities combined were million and million  respectively  at a weighted average interest rate of our five most restrictive covenants include debt to assets  secured debt to assets  fixed charge and unencumbered interest coverage and debt yield ratios 
we believe we were in full compliance with our public debt and revolving credit facility covenants as of december  our public debt covenant ratios as defined in our indenture agreement were as follows at december  covenant restriction actual debt to asset ratio less than secured debt to asset ratio less than fixed charge ratio greater than unencumbered asset test greater than 
table of contents at december   we had four interest rate contracts with an aggregate notional amount of million that were designated as fair value hedges and convert fixed interest payments at rates ranging from to to variable interest payments ranging from 
to we also have three interest rate contracts with an aggregate notional amount of million that were designated as cash flow hedges 
these contracts have maturities through september and either fix or cap interest rates ranging from to 
we have determined that these contracts are highly effective in offsetting future variable interest cash flows 
we could be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by the counter parties  however  management believes such nonperformance is unlikely 
equity in february  our board of trust managers approved an increase to our quarterly dividend rate for our common shares from 
to 
per share commencing with the first quarter distribution 
common and preferred dividends paid totaled million during our dividend payout ratio as calculated as dividends paid on common shares divided by funds from operation basic for  and approximated  and  respectively  which is inclusive of non cash transactions including impairment charges and other non cash items 
subsequent to december   our board of trust managers approved an increase to our quarterly dividend rate to 
per share 
in september  we filed a universal shelf registration statement which is effective for the next three years 
we will continue to closely monitor both the debt and equity markets and carefully consider our available financing alternatives  including both public offerings and private placements 
contractual obligations we have debt obligations related to our mortgage loans and unsecured debt  including any draws on our revolving credit facilities 
we have shopping centers that are subject to non cancelable long term ground leases where a third party owns and has leased the underlying land to us to construct and or operate a shopping center 
in addition  we have non cancelable operating leases pertaining to office space from which we conduct our business 
the table below excludes obligations related to our new development projects because such amounts are not fixed or determinable 
we have entered into commitments aggregating million comprised principally of construction contracts which are generally due in to months 
the following table summarizes our primary contractual obligations as of december  in thousands thereafter total mortgages and notes payable unsecured debt secured debt lease payments other obligations total contractual obligations includes principal and interest with interest on variable rate debt calculated using rates at december   excluding the effect of interest rate swaps

table of contents related to our investment in a development project in sheridan  colorado  we  our joint venture partner and the joint venture have each provided a guaranty for the payment of any debt service shortfalls on tax increment revenue bonds issued in connection with the project 
in  the sheridan redevelopment agency agency issued million of series a bonds used for an urban renewal project 
the bonds are to be repaid with incremental sales and property taxes and a public improvement fee pif to be assessed on current and future retail sales and  to the extent necessary  any amounts we may have to provide under a guaranty 
the incremental taxes and pif are to remain intact until the earlier of the payment of the bond liability in full or unless such date is otherwise extended by the agency 
in connection with the above project and a lawsuit settlement in  the joint venture purchased a portion of the bonds in the amount of million at par  and we established a million letter of credit 
on april   the agency remarketed the bonds  which included an extension of the incremental taxes and pif for an additional years 
all of the outstanding bonds were recalled by the agency and replaced with million in senior bonds and million in subordinate bonds 
this transaction resulted in us receiving approximately million in cash proceeds and million in new subordinated bonds replacing the face value of our million of senior bonds and million of subordinate bonds 
the subordinate bonds had been previously written down to a fair value of million 
upon the completion of this transaction  we recorded a net credit loss on the exchange of bonds of approximately million  and our million letter of credit was terminated 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   none of our off balance sheet arrangements had a material effect on our liquidity or availability of  or requirement for  our capital resources 
letters of credit totaling million and million were outstanding under the revolving credit facility at december  and  respectively 
we have entered into several unconsolidated real estate joint ventures and partnerships 
under many of these agreements  we and our joint venture partners are required to fund operating capital upon shortfalls in working capital 
we have also committed to fund the capital requirements of several new development joint ventures 
as operating manager of most of these entities  we have considered these funding requirements in our business plan 
reconsideration events  including changes in variable interests  could cause us to consolidate these joint ventures and partnerships 
we continuously evaluate these events as we become aware of them 
some triggers to be considered are additional contributions required by each partner and each partner s ability to make those contributions 
under certain of these circumstances  we may purchase our partner s interest 
our material unconsolidated real estate joint ventures are with entities which appear sufficiently stable  however  if market conditions were to continue to deteriorate and our partners are unable to meet their commitments  there is a possibility we may have to consolidate these entities 
if we were to consolidate all of our unconsolidated real estate joint ventures  we would still be in compliance with our debt covenants 
as of december   two unconsolidated real estate joint ventures were determined to be vies through the issuance of secured loans  since the lenders have the ability to make decisions that could have a significant impact on the profitability of the entities 
in addition  we have another unconsolidated real estate joint venture with an interest in an entity  which is deemed to be a vie since the unconsolidated joint venture provided a guaranty for the entity s debt 
our maximum risk of loss associated with these vies was limited to million at december  we have a real estate limited partnership agreement with a foreign institutional investor to purchase up to million of retail properties in various states 
our ownership in this unconsolidated real estate limited partnership is 
to date  no properties have been purchased 

table of contents funds from operations effective for the fourth quarter of  the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit issued updated guidance on the definition of funds from operation ffo to exclude the effects of impairment related to depreciable real estate assets and in substance real estate equity investments 
previously  our calculation of ffo did not exclude impairment of depreciable real estate assets and as a result  we have changed our presentation of ffo for all periods presented to comply with the revised guidance 
nareit defines ffo as net income loss attributable to common shareholders computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of operating real estate assets and extraordinary items  plus depreciation and amortization of operating properties and impairment of depreciable real estate and in substance real estate equity investments  including our share of unconsolidated real estate joint ventures and partnerships 
we calculate ffo in a manner consistent with the nareit definition 
we believe ffo is a widely recognized measure of reit operating performance which provides our shareholders with a relevant basis for comparison among other reits 
management uses ffo as a supplemental internal measure to conduct and evaluate our business because there are certain limitations associated with using gaap net income by itself as the primary measure of our operating performance 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  management believes that the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that uses historical cost accounting is insufficient by itself 
there can be no assurance that ffo presented by us is comparable to similarly titled measures of other reits 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or other measurements under gaap as an indicator of our operating performance or to cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as a measure of liquidity 
ffo does not reflect working capital changes  cash expenditures for capital improvements or principal payments on indebtedness 
ffo is calculated as follows in thousands year ended december  net loss income attributable to common shareholders depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization of unconsolidated real estate joint ventures and partnerships impairment of operating properties and real estate equity investments impairment of operating properties of unconsolidated real estate joint ventures and partnerships gain on acquisition gain on land and merchant development sales gain on sale of property loss gain on sale of property of unconsolidated real estate joint ventures and partnerships funds from operations basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding basic effect of dilutive securities share options and awards weighted average shares outstanding diluted

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use fixed and floating rate debt to finance our capital requirements 
these transactions expose us to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
derivative financial instruments are used to manage a portion of this risk  primarily interest rate contracts with major financial institutions 
these agreements expose us to credit risk in the event of non performance by the counter parties 
we do not engage in the trading of derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business 
at december   we had fixed rate debt of billion and variable rate debt of million  after adjusting for the net effect of million notional amount of interest rate contracts 
in the event interest rates were to increase basis points and holding all other variables constant  annual net income and cash flows for the following year would decrease by approximately million associated with our variable rate debt  including the effect of the interest rate contracts 
the effect of the basis points increase would decrease the fair value of our variable rate and fixed rate debt by approximately million and million  respectively
