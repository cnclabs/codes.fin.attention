item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview general we compete in the department store segment of the us retail industry 
founded in  the company is one of the largest regional department store operators  currently operating stores in states in the northeast  midwest and upper great plains under the bon ton  bergner s  boston store  carson pirie scott  elder beerman  herberger s and younkers nameplates and  in the detroit  michigan area  under the parisian nameplate 
our stores are predominately located in fashion oriented shopping malls and lifestyle centers  encompassing a total of approximately million square feet and offering a broad assortment of national brand and exclusive private brand fashion apparel and accessories for women  men and children as well as cosmetics  home furnishings and other goods 
the company had net sales of billion in performance and accomplishments our operations are impacted by  among other things  macroeconomic conditions that affect our customers and our business  competitive pressures  and our responsiveness to the development of new technologies and social media 
in  we continued to make targeted investments to address these economic and competitive challenges and emerging technologies  with a concerted focus on improving our customers experience and increasing the productivity of our store portfolio and online operations 
during  we believe our customers continued to experience economic pressures and were  in many instances  motivated by price 
this difficult consumer environment  coupled with our disappointing execution of certain merchandising and marketing strategies and the adverse impact of unseasonably mild weather in the fourth quarter  resulted in decreases in both sales and margin comparable store sales declined from the prior year and our gross margin rate decreased basis points to of net sales 
despite expense reductions in sg a and interest  we were unable to offset our sales and margin deficits such that we recorded a net loss of million in  as compared with net income of million in the prior year 
although we did not meet our financial goals  our efforts resulted in the following accomplishments in  achievements key to positioning ourselves for growth in and beyond we successfully implemented several merchandising initiatives in seven pilot stores  including the expansion of updated and better merchandise assortments and brands  reallocation of square footage to more productive merchandise categories  and introduction of self service online kiosks 
we expanded our shoe business in stores including the seven pilot stores  significantly increasing both square footage and brand assortment 
we continued to grow our online and mobile properties  with significant expansion of merchandise assortment and improvement in website performance and multichannel capabilities 
we launched mambo  a collection of surf wear and street wear for young men  juniors and children  and john bartlett  a line of men s apparel and accessories created by the renowned american designer  adding to our exclusive portfolio of private brands 
we opened one new store and relocated a store to an improved site in an existing market 
we completed several financing transactions that further strengthened our financial position and created additional financial flexibility to support our growth plans 

table of contents in  as part of our financing strategy  we continued our focus on opportunities to improve our credit profile and deliver value to shareholders 
in furtherance of our strategy  on january   we voluntarily prepaid our outstanding indebtedness under our second lien loan and security agreement that provided for million of term loans expiring november  the term loan facility 
as a result of such prepayment  the term loan facility was terminated 
on march   we entered into a million senior secured second amended and restated loan and security agreement the second amended revolving credit facility that expires on the earlier of a march  and b the date that is days prior to the earlier of the maturity date of our senior notes the senior notes and the mortgage loan facility 
the second amended revolving credit facility replaced our prior million revolving credit facility  which was scheduled to mature on june  the revolving credit facility 
in the fourth quarter of  we repurchased at a discount  in open market transactions  a total of million principal amount of the million aggregate principal outstanding of our senior notes 
as a result of the aforementioned financing activity  we reduced our interest expense in and realized a net gain on the extinguishment of debt 
our interest expense decreased million  largely the result of reduced borrowing levels and lower interest rates due to our prepayment of the term loan facility and entry into the second amended revolving credit facility 
the repurchase of our senior notes resulted in a gain of million 
this gain was partially offset by a million loss primarily for an early termination fee associated with the prepayment of the term loan facility and accelerated deferred financing fees associated with the term loan facility and the revolving credit facility  resulting in a net gain on extinguishment of debt of million 
see results of operations compared with for further discussion of our interest expense and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our long term debt 
on december   we entered into a new  seven year private label credit card program agreement with ads  which will replace our current agreement with hbsc 
our current proprietary credit card program with hsbc will remain in place until the accounts portfolio sale from hsbc to ads occurs in the second quarter of strategies and guidance we are taking actions to address our operating performance and are focused on strategies to accelerate sales growth and improve our financial results in the years ahead  including i the expansion of our successful merchandising initiatives from the seven pilot stores to additional stores in  ii the reallocation of marketing expenditures to increase effectiveness through the expanded employment of new  multi channel technologies  iii the continued investment in our online and mobile platform operations  iv the renewed focus on our small stores in niche markets to capitalize on our competitive advantages and v the increased penetration of our proprietary credit card sales to total sales

current and future expansions of our online and mobile platforms consist of 
table of contents investments in inventory  marketing  fulfillment capabilities and site development  all of which complement ongoing efforts to improve customer service and drive sales 
we believe our smaller markets provide significant growth opportunity as we generally face less competition in these niche markets for our national and private label brands 
we plan to strategically expand our strongest merchandise categories in the targeted markets as we seek to maximize our return 
building on our established customer relationships and broad customer base  we are looking to grow our sales through the increased penetration of our proprietary credit card 
to achieve this  we will target the next generation customer through focused marketing efforts including a digital marketing campaign 
additionally  our continued commitment to accelerating new account acquisitions will be aided by a renewed focus on sales promotion efforts such as targeted mailings  cardholder events and updates to our loyalty program 
in  we expect to achieve earnings per diluted share ranging from to 
on march   we provided the following assumptions with respect to our guidance a comparable store sales increase ranging from to  a gross margin rate to basis points higher than the rate of  a million to million increase in sg a expense from the expense of million a portion of which is attributable to the addition of the rd week in  a tax rate of  capital expenditures not to exceed million  net of external contributions  and an estimated million to million average diluted shares outstanding 
we are finding cost pressures on our inventory have moderated since their peak in  however  we do not expect to realize lower costs until mid due to the timing of production 
in our private brands  where we have greater control over the production and manufacturing of merchandise  we will continue to diversify production to lower cost markets 
overall  we anticipate cost increases of approximately five to seven percent in the spring season of over spring levels  and cost decreases of approximately five to ten percent in fall from fall earnings per share guidance does not reflect any non cash income tax benefit of reducing the valuation allowance currently recorded for deferred tax assets 
the amount of such adjustment cannot be determined until our results are final

ebitda is not calculated in the same manner by all companies and accordingly is not necessarily comparable to similarly entitled measures of other companies and may not be an appropriate measure for performance relative to other companies 
ebitda should not be assessed in isolation from or construed as a substitute for net income or cash flows from operations  which are prepared in accordance with gaap

at january   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million available under our second amended revolving credit facility before taking into account the minimum borrowing availability covenant under such facility 
excess availability was million as of the comparable prior year period under the revolving credit facility 
the decrease in excess availability primarily reflects increased direct borrowings  partially offset by an increased borrowing base availability 
the year to year comparison of excess availability is impacted by our prepayment of the million term loan facility in the first month of the first quarter of  terminating a prior year source of funding 
typically  cash flows from operations are impacted by consumer confidence  weather in the geographic markets served by the company  and economic and competitive conditions existing in the retail industry  a downturn in any single factor or a combination of factors could have a material adverse impact upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to operate our business

table of contents critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
preparation of these financial statements required us to make estimates and judgments that affected reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to merchandise returns  the valuation of inventories  long lived assets  intangible assets  insurance reserves  contingencies  litigation and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes and retirement and other post employment benefits  among others 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially lead to materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe our critical accounting policies are as described below 
for a discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see the notes to consolidated financial statements 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined by the retail inventory method 
under the retail inventory method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margin is derived by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
the retail inventory method is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry 
use of the retail inventory method will result in valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market if markdowns are taken timely as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
inherent in the retail inventory method calculation are certain significant management judgments and estimates including  among others  merchandise markups  markdowns and shrinkage  which significantly impact both the ending inventory valuation at cost and the resulting gross margin 
these significant estimates  coupled with the fact that the retail inventory method is an averaging process  can  under certain circumstances  result in individual inventory components with cost above related net realizable value 
factors that can lead to this result include applying the retail inventory method to a group of products that is not fairly uniform in terms of its cost  selling price relationship and turnover  or applying the retail inventory method to transactions that include different rates of gross profit  such as those relating to seasonal merchandise 
in addition  failure to take timely markdowns can result in an overstatement of inventory under the lower of cost or market principle 
we believe that the retail inventory method we use provides an inventory valuation that approximates cost and results in carrying inventory in the aggregate at the lower of cost or market 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record an adjustment for excess or old inventory based primarily on an estimated forecast of merchandise demand for the selling season 
demand for merchandise can fluctuate greatly 
a significant increase in the demand for merchandise could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  estimates of future merchandise demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the adjustment required for excess or old inventory 
if our inventory is determined to be overvalued in the future  we would be required to recognize such costs in costs of goods sold and reduce operating income at the time of such determination 
likewise  if inventory is later determined to be undervalued  we may have overstated the costs of goods sold in previous periods and would recognize additional operating income when such inventory is sold 
therefore  although 
table of contents every effort is made to ensure the accuracy of forecasts of merchandise demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or in economic conditions within our markets could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and reported operating results 
as of january  and january   approximately and  respectively  of our inventories were valued using a first in  first out cost basis and approximately and  respectively  of our inventories were valued using a last in  first out lifo cost basis 
as is currently the case with many companies in the retail industry  our lifo calculations yielded inventory increases due to deflation reflected in price indices used 
the lifo method values merchandise sold at the cost of more recent inventory purchases which the deflationary indices indicated to be lower  resulting in the general inventory on hand being carried at the older  higher costs 
given these higher values and the promotional retail environment  we have reduced the carrying value of our lifo inventories to an estimated realizable value 
these reductions totaled million and million as of january  and january   respectively 
inherent in the valuation of inventories are significant management judgments and estimates regarding future merchandise selling costs and pricing 
should these estimates prove to be inaccurate  we may have overstated or understated our inventory carrying value 
in such cases  operating results would ultimately be impacted 
vendor allowances as is standard industry practice  allowances from merchandise vendors are received as reimbursement for charges incurred on marked down merchandise 
vendor allowances are recorded when determined to be collectable 
allowances are credited to costs of goods sold  provided the allowance is for merchandise permanently marked down or sold  not predicated on a future purchase  and not predicated on a future increase in the purchase price from the vendor 
if the aforementioned criteria are not met  the allowances are recorded as an adjustment to the cost of merchandise capitalized in inventory and reflected as a reduction of costs of merchandise sold when the related merchandise is sold 
additionally  allowances are received from vendors in connection with cooperative advertising programs and for reimbursement of certain payroll expenses 
to the extent the reimbursements are for specific  incremental and identifiable advertising or payroll costs incurred to sell the vendor s products and do not exceed the costs incurred  they are recognized as a reduction of sg a expense 
if the aforementioned criteria are not met  the allowances are recorded as an adjustment to the cost of merchandise capitalized in inventory and reflected as a reduction of costs of merchandise sold when the related merchandise is sold 
income taxes significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
the process involves summarizing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
in addition  we are required to assess whether valuation allowances should be established against our deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard 
to the extent a valuation allowance is established in a period  an expense must generally be recorded within the income tax provision in the statement of operations 
we reported net deferred tax liabilities of million and million at january  and january   respectively 
in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets  we considered whether it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized based upon all available evidence  including scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  historical operating results  projected future operating results  tax carry back availability and limitations pursuant to section of the 
table of contents internal revenue code  among others 
significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
as a result  current or previous losses are given more weight than any projected future taxable income 
in addition  a recent three year historical cumulative loss is considered a significant element of negative evidence that is difficult to overcome 
we evaluate our deferred tax assets each reporting period  including assessment of the company s cumulative income or loss over the prior three year period  to determine if valuation allowances are required 
with respect to our reviews during  and  our three year historical cumulative loss and the continuation of uncertain near term economic conditions impeded our ability to rely on our projections of future taxable income in assessing valuation allowance requirements 
as such  we concluded it was necessary to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets 
our deferred tax asset valuation allowance totaled million and million at january  and january   respectively 
if actual results differ from these estimates or these estimates are adjusted in future periods  the valuation allowance may need to be adjusted  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
if sufficient positive evidence arises in the future indicating that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets meet the more likely than not standard for realization  the valuation allowance would be reduced accordingly in the period that such a conclusion is reached 
if reduced  a maximum of million of the valuation allowance reduction would result in an increase to paid in capital rather than an income tax benefit 
we recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained 
recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than likely of being realized 
changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs 
interpretations and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time  and changes to our assumptions and judgments could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
long lived assets property  fixtures and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of such assets 
changes in our business model or capital strategy can result in the actual useful lives differing from estimates 
in cases where we determined the useful life of property  fixtures and equipment should be shortened  we depreciated the net book value in excess of the salvage value over the revised remaining useful life  thereby increasing depreciation expense 
factors such as changes in the planned use of fixtures or leasehold improvements could also result in shortened useful lives 
our net property  fixtures and equipment amounted to million and million at january  and january   respectively 
we are required to test a long lived asset for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance of stores relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of assets or overall business strategy  and significant negative industry or economic trends for a sustained period 
if the undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are insufficient to support the recorded asset  an impairment loss is recognized for the amount if any by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
cash flow estimates are based on historical results  adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
estimates of fair value are determined through various techniques  including discounted cash flow models and market approaches  as considered necessary 
should cash flow estimates differ significantly from actual results  an 
table of contents impairment could arise and materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
given the seasonality of operations  impairment is not conclusive  in many cases  until after the holiday period in the fourth quarter is concluded 
newly opened stores may take time to generate positive operating and cash flow results 
factors such as store type  store location  current marketplace awareness of private label brands  local customer demographic data and current fashion trends are all considered in determining the time frame required for a store to achieve positive financial results 
if conditions prove to be substantially different from expectations  the carrying value of new stores long lived assets may ultimately become impaired 
we evaluated the recoverability of our long lived assets and  as a result  in we recognized impairment charges of million which resulted in a reduction in the carrying amount of certain marginally performing store properties 
in and we recognized asset impairment charges of million and million  respectively  which resulted in a reduction in the carrying amount of certain store and distribution center properties 
these analyses anticipate certain economic conditions 
should economic conditions be worse than anticipated  additional impairment charges could result 
intangible assets net intangible assets totaled million and million at january  and january   respectively 
our intangible assets at january  are principally comprised of million of lease interests that relate to below market rate leases and million associated with trade names  private label brand names and customer lists 
the lease related interests are being amortized using a straight line method 
the customer lists are being amortized using a declining balance method 
at january   lease related interests and customer lists had average remaining lives of years and seven years  respectively  for amortization purposes 
at january   trade names and private label brand names of million have been deemed as having indefinite lives 
intangible assets that have indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values 
fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis  which requires certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors 
our policy is to conduct impairment testing based on our most current business plans  which reflect anticipated changes in the economy and the industry 
as a result of the decline in our business performance in  we recognized asset impairment charges of million and million on three indefinite lived trade names and one private label brand name  respectively 
no adjustment was required pursuant to our review of the carrying amount of intangible assets in in  we recorded an asset impairment charge of million related to a reduction in the value of two indefinite lived private label brand names 
should significant changes in the manner of our use of assets or overall business strategy  future results or economic events cause us to adjust our projected cash flows  future estimates of fair value may not support the carrying amount of these assets 
if actual results prove inconsistent with our assumptions and judgments  we could be exposed to a material impairment charge 
insurance reserve estimates we use a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks  including workers compensation  general liability and employee related health care benefits  a portion of which is paid by our associates 
we determine the estimates for the liabilities associated with these risks by considering historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
a change in claims frequency and severity of claims from historical experience as well as changes in state statutes and the mix of states in which we operate could result in a change to the required reserve levels 

table of contents pension and supplementary retirement plans we provide an unfunded supplementary pension plan to certain key executives 
through acquisitions  we acquired a defined benefit pension plan and assumed the liabilities of three supplementary pension plans and a postretirement benefit plan 
major assumptions used in accounting for these plans include the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on the defined benefit plan s assets 
the discount rate assumption is evaluated annually 
we utilize the citibank pension discount curve to develop the discount rate assumption 
a single constant discount rate is developed based on the expected timing of the benefit payments 
we base our asset return assumption on current and expected allocations of assets  as well as a long term view of expected returns on the plan asset categories 
we assess the appropriateness of the expected rate of return on an annual basis and  when necessary  revise the assumption 
at january   our target pension plan asset allocation was equity securities  fixed income and hedge funds 
changes in the assumptions regarding the discount rate and expected return on plan assets may result in materially different expense and liability amounts 
actuarial estimations may differ materially from actual results  reflecting many factors including changing market and economic conditions  changes in investment strategies  higher or lower withdrawal rates and longer or shorter life spans of participants 
in addition  the funded status of this plan and the related cost reflected in our financial statements are affected by various factors that are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty  particularly in the current economic environment 
losses of asset values of the defined benefit pension plan may require us to fund obligations earlier than we forecasted in order to meet minimum federal government requirements  which would have a negative impact on cash flows from operations 
in the first quarter of  we paid million pursuant to the termination of one of our unfunded supplemental pension plans 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 presentation of comprehensive income asu  which amends fasb codification topic on comprehensive income disclosures 
the new guidance allows an entity to present components of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement  referred to as the statement of comprehensive income  or in two separate  but consecutive statements 
the new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity 
while the new guidance changes the presentation of comprehensive income  there are no changes to the components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under current accounting guidance 
this new guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of asu to have an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows as it requires only a change in the format of presentation 
in may  asu no 
 amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs asu  was issued  amending fasb codification topic asc on fair value measurements and disclosures 
the amendments clarify the fasb s intent regarding application of existing fair value measurement guidance  revise certain measurement and disclosure requirements that change or modify a principle to achieve convergence with international accounting standards and expand the information required to be disclosed with respect to fair value measurements categorized in level fair value measurements 
the amendments to asc made by asu are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of asu to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk and financial instruments we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates 
to provide some protection against potential rate increases associated with our variable rate borrowing facilities  we have previously entered into  and may in the future enter into  interest rate swap agreements to change the fixed variable interest rate mix of our debt portfolio in order to maintain an appropriate balance of fixed rate and variable rate debt and to mitigate the impact of volatile interest rates 
we have not entered into new interest rate swap agreements since the expiration of our prior interest rate swaps on july  during and  we did not enter into or hold derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
the following table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates at january  expected maturity date by year dollars in thousands there after total fair value debt fixed rate debt average fixed rate variable rate debt average variable rate the variable rate debt is the second amended revolving credit facility that expires on the earlier of a march  and b the date that is days prior to the earlier of the maturity date of the senior notes and the mortgage loan facility 
seasonality and inflation our business  like that of most retailers  is subject to seasonal fluctuations  with the major portion of sales and income realized during the second half of each fiscal year  which includes the holiday season 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for the company s quarterly results for and due to the fixed nature of certain costs  sg a expense is typically higher as a percentage of net sales during the first half of each year 
working capital requirements fluctuate during the year as well and generally reach their highest levels during the third and fourth quarters 
because of the seasonality of our business  results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for a full year 
in addition  quarterly operating results are impacted by the timing and amount of revenues and costs associated with the opening of new stores and the closing and remodeling of existing stores 
we do not believe inflation has had a material effect on operating results during the past three years 
we did  however  experience inflationary conditions in our merchandise and transportation costs in in our private brands  where we have more control over the production and manufacturing of the merchandise  we have historically been able to minimize inflationary pressures through measures such as committing earlier for merchandise purchases and shifting production to lower cost markets 
our third party brand vendors are also facing the same inflationary pressures 
we will continue to work with these vendors  as possible  to minimize the impact of inflation on our merchandise costs and our selling prices 
overall  we anticipate cost increases of approximately five to seven percent in the spring season of over spring levels  and cost decreases of approximately five to ten percent in fall from fall
