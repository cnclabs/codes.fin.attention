overview we are a pharmaceutical company dedicated primarily to the discovery and development of novel small molecule therapeutics with a focus on oncology and hematology 
we changed our name from supergen  inc to astex pharmaceuticals  inc 
in september we believe we are developing a proprietary pipeline of novel medicines for partnership with leading pharmaceutical companies 
we believe we are a leader in the application of fragment based drug discovery and development of small molecule therapeutics 
fragment based drug discovery is considered by many in our sector to be one of the most important advances in discovery chemistry in the last years 
we currently receive development and license revenue from partnered programs and royalty revenues relating to sales of dacogen decitabine for injection  a product approved by the fda for the treatment of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes mds  which is licensed to eisai corporation 
on july   we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of astex therapeutics limited atl  a privately held uk based biotechnology company with particular expertise in fragment based drug discovery 
pursuant to the acquisition  we paid approximately million in cash and issued million shares of our common stock representing approximately of our issued and outstanding stock as of the closing of the acquisition after giving effect to the issuance of such shares to the securityholders of atl 
in addition  we will pay deferred consideration of million in stock  cash  or a combination of stock and cash  to be determined at the discretion of the company  no later than months after the closing of the acquisition january 

table of contents atl discovers and develops novel small molecule therapeutics 
using its fragment based drug discovery platform  pyramid  atl has built a pipeline of molecularly targeted drugs for large pharmaceutical partners and internal development that are at various stages of clinical  pre clinical and early discovery development 
our primary developmental efforts revolve around the products progressing out of our small molecule drug discovery programs 
our two lead programs are at  a novel hsp inhibitor  coming out of our atl acquisition  and sgi  a novel second generation hypomethylating agent 
the third product in our clinical pipeline is amuvatinib mp  our multi targeted kinase inhibitor and dna repair suppressor 
we are currently conducting a phase ii trial for amuvatinib in small cell lung cancer called escape 
we also have partnered clinical trials ongoing for at  a cdk inhibitor  and at  an aurora jak inhibitor 
in addition to our own clinical pipeline  we maintain several partnerships with pharmaceutical companies and may receive development and license revenue in the future based on program advancement 
our founding strategy was to in license late stage clinical products and commercialize these products by executing selective developmental and commercialization strategies that might allow these products to come into the market and be utilized by the widest possible patient populations 
however  the competition for late stage compounds that can be obtained through licensure or acquisition  that have shown initial efficacy in humans  has increased significantly with most major pharmaceutical companies and emerging biotechnology companies taking positions in this market 
we believe that our current strategy attempts to mitigate the competitive risk of in licensure and positions us to out license selective products to our licensing competitors or other pharmaceutical companies 
our primary objective is to become a leading developer and seller or licensor of medicines for patients suffering from cancer 
we currently receive royalty revenues relating to sales of dacogen for treatment of patients with mds 
we are entitled to receive a royalty on worldwide net sales of dacogen starting at and escalating to a maximum of 
we recognize royalty revenue when the royalty statement is received from eisai because we do not have sufficient ability to accurately estimate dacogen sales prior to that time 
in  eisai executed an agreement to sublicense dacogen to cilag gmbh international cilag  a johnson johnson company  granting exclusive development and commercialization rights in all territories outside north america 
cilag is responsible for conducting regulatory and commercial activities related to dacogen in all territories outside north america  while eisai retains all commercialization rights and responsibility for all activities in the united states  canada and mexico 
as a result of both the original agreement with eisai and the sublicense with cilag  we may receive up to million in future contingent payments dependent upon achievements for dacogen globally 
in the second half of  the company will learn the outcome of cilag s maa submission to the ema  seeking approval for dacogen in the elderly acute myeloid leukemia indication 
all of our current products  other than dacogen  are in the development or clinical trial stage  and will require substantial additional investments in research and development  clinical trials  regulatory and sales and marketing activities to commercialize these product candidates 
conducting clinical trials is a lengthy  time consuming  and expensive process involving inherent uncertainties and risks  and our studies may be insufficient to demonstrate safety and efficacy to support fda approval of any of our product candidates 
as a result of our substantial research and development expenditures and minimal product revenues  we have incurred cumulative losses of million through december   and have not consistently generated enough funds through our operations to support our business 
although we were profitable in the years ended december  and  we expect to have operating losses over the next few years and we may never achieve sustained profitability 

table of contents ultimately  our ability to sustain profitability will depend upon a variety of factors  including regulatory approvals of our products  the timing of the introduction and market acceptance of our products and competing products  eisai s success in selling dacogen  the success of our various collaborative  research and license arrangements  the launch of new products and our ability to control our ongoing costs and operating expenses 
if our drug discovery and research efforts are not successful  or if the results from our clinical trials are not positive  we may not be able to get sufficient funding to continue our trials or conduct new trials  and we would be forced to scale down or cease our business operations 
moreover  if our products are not approved or commercially accepted we will remain unprofitable for longer than we currently anticipate 
additionally  we might be forced to substantially scale down our operations or sell certain of our assets  and it is likely the price of our stock would decline precipitously 
critical accounting policies our management discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and reported disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  impairment of goodwill  intangible assets  investments  and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are more fully disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
however  some of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
intangible assets and goodwill the fair value of the identified intangible assets recorded in the acquisition of atl was estimated by using income or cost replacement approaches 
the acquisition of atl also created goodwill as the purchase price exceeded the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired net of the liabilities assumed 
the value assigned to developed technology is being amortized over seven years and the value assigned to non active collaboration agreements is being amortized over five years  the estimated useful lives of the assets 
we do not amortize goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
we test goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis in december and in between annual tests if we become aware of any events occurring or changes in circumstances that would indicate a reduction in the fair value of the assets below their carrying amounts 
the annual test for goodwill impairment is a two step process 
in the first step we compare the carrying value of the company s net assets including goodwill with its fair value 
we determine the fair value of the company based on its market capitalization using quoted market prices of its common stock  and taking into account other factors that may affect the fair value of the company as a whole 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value of the company s net assets  then in the second step  the impairment loss is measured as the excess  if any  of recorded goodwill over its implied fair value 

table of contents implied fair value is the excess of the fair value of the company over the fair value of all its identified assets and liabilities 
in december  we performed an annual goodwill impairment test 
during the last quarter of and in through the filing date of these financial statements  there has been significant fluctuation in the quoted market prices of our common stock 
significant judgment is required to evaluate the fair value of the company 
we concluded  based on the changes in the market prices of the company s common stock during this period and our assessment of the premium a market participant would be willing to pay to acquire control of the company  that goodwill was not impaired  as the fair value of the company as a whole exceeded the carrying value of its net assets 
such excess was relatively insignificant and consequently  we will continue to monitor the company s market capitalization and other events and circumstances affecting its fair value  and will evaluate our goodwill for potential impairment in future periods 
should we conclude in a future period that the fair value of the company as a whole is less than the carrying value of its net assets  it is likely that we will record a material charge for goodwill impairment  which could be as high as the entire goodwill amount 
we test indefinite lived intangibles for impairment by comparing the carrying value of these intangibles to their fair value  and record an impairment loss for any excess 
in october  janssen  exercised its right under our research alliance to terminate its participation in the development of one compound  which constituted one of the in process research and development assets we acquired with atl in july as a result  we concluded there was a decline in the fair value of the corresponding indefinite lived intangible asset compared to the amount we recorded upon the acquisition of atl in july we determined the new fair value of this intangible based on an estimated likelihood of continuing the research and development through a similar collaboration agreement 
we recorded a  charge during the year ended december  related to this impairment 
should we decide in the future to abandon this project or others for which we have recorded intangible assets  we may have to record additional impairment charges 
intangible assets related to in process research and development projects are considered to be indefinite lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts 
if and when development is completed  the associated assets would be deemed finite lived and would then be amortized based on their respective estimated useful lives at that point in time 
if we abandon a research and development project its value will be written off and recognized as an impairment loss 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation at the fair value estimated on the measurement date using the black scholes option pricing model based on assumptions for volatility  risk free interest rates  expected life of the option  and dividends if any 
expected volatility is determined using a blend of historical and implied volatility of our common stock based on the period of time corresponding to the expected life of the stock options 
the expected life of our stock options is based on our historical data and represents the period of time that stock options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant commensurate with the expected life assumption 
we are using the straight line attribution method to recognize stock based compensation expense 
the amount of stock based compensation recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest  including awards that vest based on certain performance criteria 
we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise them  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the term forfeitures is distinct from cancellations or expirations and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option 
this analysis is re evaluated quarterly and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary based 
table of contents upon historical data 
ultimately  the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those shares that vest 
as of december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock based awards that vest based upon service conditions or vest based upon performance conditions and are probable of vesting 
this cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
revenue recognition eisai is required to pay us royalties starting at and escalating to a maximum of of net worldwide dacogen sales within days after the end of each calendar quarter 
during the year ended december   we recorded royalty revenue of million 
because we do not have sufficient ability to accurately estimate dacogen sales  we recognize royalty revenue when we receive the royalty statement from eisai 
in accordance with our license agreement with eisai  we are entitled to receive of any payments eisai receives as a result of any sublicenses 
we recognize milestone fees upon completion of specified substantive at risk milestones according to the related contract terms 
we enter into revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  such as intellectual property rights and research and development services 
for these arrangements  we generally have not met the criteria to separate the deliverables for revenue recognition purposes and we have treated the deliverables as a combined unit of accounting 
as such  non refundable up front payments received in connection with research and license agreements have been deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the relevant estimated periods of continuing involvement  generally the research term 
we re evaluate the period of continuing involvement each reporting period and adjust our estimates accordingly 
advance payments in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue until earned 
revenues associated with substantive  at risk milestones pursuant to atl s collaborative agreements will be recognized upon achievement of the milestones through option exercise by the collaboration partner 
we consider a milestone to be substantive at the inception of the arrangement if it is commensurate with either our performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone  it relates solely to past performance  and it is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement 
non refundable contingent future amounts receivable in connection with future events specified in the collaboration agreement that are not considered milestones will be recognized as revenue when payments are earned from our collaborators through completion of any underlying performance obligations  the amounts are fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
impairment of investments in financial instruments investments in financial instruments are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices  with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders equity 
our investment portfolio includes equity securities that could subject us to material equity market risk and corporate and us government or us governmental agency obligations that subject us to varying levels of credit risk 
an other than temporary decline in fair value of a financial instrument will be subject to a write down resulting in a charge against earnings 
the determination of whether a decline in fair value is other than temporary requires significant judgment  and could have a material impact on our balance sheet and results of operations 
our management reviews the securities within our portfolio for other than temporary declines in value on a regular basis 
as of december   the gross unrealized losses on available for sale debt securities was approximately  and such losses were not attributed to changes in credit risk 
the prices of some of our marketable equity securities are subject to considerable volatility 
currently we own  
table of contents shares of avi bio pharma  inc avi and recorded an other than temporary decline in value of million related to this investment during the year ended december  at december   our investment in avi was trading at below its carrying value of per share  but the investment has been in an unrealized loss position for less than six months and is deemed to be temporary 
decreases in the fair value of our securities may significantly impact our results of operations 
investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair value are carried at cost 
we periodically review those carried costs  amounting to  as of december   and evaluate whether an impairment has occurred 
the determination of whether an impairment has occurred requires significant judgment  as each investment has unique market and development opportunities 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu relating to fair value measurements 
this guidance clarifies the application of existing fair value measurements and disclosures  and changes certain principles or requirements for fair value measurements and disclosures 
these amendments are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  the adoption of this amendment will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued asu on the presentation of comprehensive income  which amends current comprehensive income guidance 
these amendments will require companies to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income either as one continuous statement or as two consecutive statements 
it eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the amended guidance  which must be applied retroactively  is effective for annual periods beginning after december   with earlier adoption permitted 
this amendment will impact the presentation of our financial statements  but will have no effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued asu on testing goodwill for impairment 
under these amendments  an entity may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if determined to be necessary  the two step impairment test shall be used to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of a goodwill impairment loss to be recognized  if any 
the amendment is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect that adoption of this amendment will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations revenues in thousands royalty revenue development and license revenue total revenues the increases in royalty revenue are due to higher worldwide dacogen product sales by eisai 
eisai is required to pay us royalties starting at and escalating to a maximum of of net dacogen sales within days after the end of each calendar quarter 
we recognize royalty revenue when we receive the royalty statements from eisai because we do not have sufficient ability to accurately estimate dacogen sales prior to that time 
for example  the royalty revenues recorded in represent eisai s dacogen sales for the fourth quarter of and the first three quarters of 
table of contents development and license revenue includes the recognition of up front payments received from gsk and janssen in connection with research and license agreements of   and  in  and  respectively 
the increase in revenue from up front payments in from relates to the research alliance with janssen that generated revenue subsequent to our acquisition of atl 
included within the revenue from up front payments in is recognition of the remaining deferred revenue balance of  related to the janssen research alliance during the fourth quarter of when janssen exercised its right to terminate its participation in the development of one compound 
the increase in revenue from up front payments in from relates to the collaboration with gsk that we entered into in the fourth quarter of up front payments have been deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the relevant estimated periods of continuing involvement  generally the research term 
development and license revenue in also includes the receipt of contingent payments of  based upon achievement of specific performance criteria under our gsk collaboration agreement 
operating expenses in thousands research and development general and administrative amortization of intangibles and impairment charge gain on sale of products total operating expenses the increase in research and development expenses from to was primarily due to the consolidation of atl s activities from the acquisition date of july  and corresponding expenditures related to drug discovery efforts and clinical trial costs for at  sgi  and amuvatinib  and one time severance costs of  in the decrease in research and development expenses from to was primarily due to lower contracted outside research and development services for several of our drug candidates and lower clinical trial costs related to our phase i and phase ib clinical trials for amuvatinib 
we conduct research internally and through collaborations with third parties as we continue to maintain a strong commitment to our research and development efforts 
our research and development activities consist primarily of drug discovery  drug development  and pre clinical and clinical development  as we advance our existing product candidates through clinical trials 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  employee benefits and other personnel related costs  stock based compensation expense  laboratory equipment and supplies  third party consultant fees and contract labor  costs for pre clinical and clinical trials  including clinical research organizations  other outsourced research  depreciation expense  corporate overhead  and allocated facility costs 
we do not allocate certain of our internal research and development costs such as salaries and other personnel related costs  corporate overhead and facility costs to our development programs on a project by project basis 
these costs are incurred across all programs and activities and contribute to many discovery  research and development programs including a broad range of scientific research projects  many of which fail in the early stages of discovery and development 
we do allocate direct salaries and third party costs to certain major development programs that are generally in later stages of pre clinical or clinical development 
our scientists record their time to such specific projects when appropriate  however  many activities simultaneously benefit multiple projects and cannot be readily attributed to a specific program 
accordingly  the accurate assignment of time and costs to a specific project is difficult and does not give a true indication of the actual costs of a particular project on a 
table of contents fully burdened basis 
below is a summary of direct salaries and third party costs that are identifiable for our major drug programs third party costs and direct salaries identifiable by project in thousands cumulative to date amuvatinib sgi sgi at at at all other projects conducting clinical trials is a lengthy  expensive and uncertain process 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more 
the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of the product candidate 
our clinical trials may be suspended at any time if we or the fda believe the patients participating in our studies are exposed to unacceptable health risks 
we may encounter problems in our studies which will cause us or the fda to delay or suspend the studies 
because of these uncertainties  we cannot predict when or whether we will successfully complete the development of our product candidates or the ultimate product development cost for any of our product candidates 
the increase in general and administrative expenses from to relates primarily to acquisition costs of million relating to the acquisition of atl and the consolidation of atl s activities from the acquisition date of july   as well as higher stock based compensation and legal expenses 
the increase in general and administrative expenses from to relates primarily to higher costs for accounting and tax consultation fees  additional mailing and consulting costs relating to our annual stockholder meeting and related proxy solicitation  and additional investor relations and business development consulting expenses  offset in part by lower stock based compensation expenses 
amortization of intangible assets was recorded during as a result of our acquisition of atl including developed technology and non active collaboration intangible assets 
we record amortization using the straight line method  which approximates the pattern in which we expect to derive benefits from the use of these assets  over the estimated useful lives of the intangibles years for developed technology and years for non active collaborations 
during the year ended december   we have recorded amortization of  related to the developed technology and  related to the non active collaboration agreements 
we expect to record amortization expense of approximately  in each of the next four years   in the fifth year   in the sixth year  and  in the seventh year 
however  since the underlying intangible assets are denominated in british pounds sterling and translated to us dollars  the amounts we record as amortization expense may vary due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
in addition  during we recorded an impairment charge of  related to the reduction in the fair value of one of our active collaboration intangibles that resulted from janssen terminating its participation in the development of one compound 
as a result of the termination  janssen will not be obligated to make any payments of milestones or royalties associated with the development of this compound in the future 
we may not identify another research and development partner for this compound  and may choose not to pursue further research and development of this compound if we believe that our resources can be more efficiently deployed for other projects 
as a result  we concluded there was a decline in the fair value of the corresponding indefinite lived intangible asset compared to the amount we recorded upon the acquisition of atl in july we determined the new fair value of this intangible based on an estimated likelihood of continuing the research and development through a similar collaboration agreement 
gain on sale of products relates to the sale of our north american and worldwide rights to nipent to hospira 
gain on sale of products for the year ended december  represented the receipt of 
table of contents a  payment from hospira relating to the sale of the worldwide rights for nipent  a  reduction of our price protection reserve  and  relating to the reversal of a residual products return reserve that was no longer required due to the expiration of the contractual return period 
gain on sale of products for the year ended december  represented the receipt of a  payment from hospira relating to the sale of the worldwide rights for nipent and a  elimination of the remaining balance of our price protection reserve relating to the north american agreement 
the  gain on sale of products for the year ended december  represented a payment from hospira relating to the sale of the nipent worldwide rights 
we expect to receive one additional  payment in  representing the final payment due under the sale of the worldwide rights for nipent 
other income expense and income tax benefit provision in thousands interest income other income expense income tax benefit provision the changes in interest income have been due primarily to variations in interest rates 
other expense recorded in primarily represents losses on foreign currency transactions and disposals of fixed assets  offset in part by changes in the value of a warrant liability 
other income in represented receipt of proceeds under the qualifying therapeutic discovery project program relating to our qualifying research and development programs 
the income tax benefit for was primarily due to the recognition of tax benefits associated with the amortization of deferred tax liabilities resulting from the acquisition of atl and uk research and development tax credits 
the tax provision of  in represented state tax provisions  taking into account estimated net operating loss carrybacks and research and development tax credits 
in  we recorded a tax benefit of  which was primarily due to the worker  home ownership and business assistance act of  signed into law on november   that allowed for certain net operating losses to be used to eliminate or refund alternative minimum tax  as well as monetization of research credits and other state tax benefits 
liquidity and capital resources our cash  cash equivalents  and current and non current marketable securities totaled million at december   compared to million at december  net cash provided by operating activities was million in and consisted primarily of the net income of million plus non cash depreciation of million  non cash amortization of intangibles and impairment charge of million  non cash stock based compensation expense of million  decrease in restricted cash of million  and an increase in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities of million  offset in part by an increase in accounts receivable of million  an increase in income tax receivable of million  a decrease in deferred tax liability of million  and a decrease in deferred revenue of million

our contractual obligations as of december  are as follows in thousands payments due by period total year years years after years operating leases total contractual cash obligations our principal administrative facility is currently located in leased general office space  containing approximately  square feet  in dublin  california  under a lease that expires in november as part of the acquisition of atl  we assumed the property lease on a  square foot laboratory and administrative building in cambridge  uk 
the lease was executed in march for a year term 
we are currently leasing  square feet of space for our drug discovery laboratory operations in salt lake city  utah 
the lease on this space expires in may we will pay the former atl stockholders deferred consideration of million in stock  cash  or a combination of stock and cash  to be determined at the discretion of the company 
deferred consideration will be paid in semi annual installments whose amounts will be determined based on the amounts of the contingent payments atl has received and will receive under its collaboration arrangements during the period from january  through january  the amount of the future semi annual installments reflects our best estimates of the probability and timing of collaboration milestones to be received 
we paid the first deferred consideration installment of million in early february we currently estimate that remaining installments will be approximately million in july  million in january  million in july  and million in january avicine  avi biopharma s proprietary cancer vaccine  will require significant additional expenditures to complete the clinical development necessary to gain marketing approval from the fda and equivalent foreign regulatory agencies 
as part of our agreement with avi biopharma  we are obligated to make additional payments to avi based on successful achievement of developmental  regulatory approval  and commercialization milestones over the next several years that could total million 
however  no significant development efforts have been incurred for avicine since and none are anticipated in the near future 
we are unable to determine precisely when and if our payment obligations under our agreement with avi will become due as these obligations are based on milestone events  the achievement of which is subject to a significant number of risks and uncertainties 
because some of the milestone events are revenue related and the payment obligation would not be triggered absent our receipt of revenues  we may be able to use funds generated from revenues to make the milestone payments if they become due 
additionally  there is a million remaining future contingent regulatory milestone payment due to the former montigen stockholders when and if the related milestone is achieved  which is payable in shares of our common stock 

table of contents we have financed our operations primarily through the issuance of equity and debt securities  the receipt of milestone  royalty and other payments in connection with collaborative agreements  and the sale of non core assets 
based on our current forecasted product development activities  we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and other investments will satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we may pursue additional financing options  including the selling of additional shares of stock in public or private offerings 
we believe that our need for additional funding will increase in the future  especially if we acquire new product technologies for development and sale  and our ability to continue raising funds from external sources will be critical to our success 
we continue to actively consider future contractual arrangements that would require significant financial commitments 
if we experience currently unanticipated cash requirements  we could require additional capital much sooner than presently anticipated 
we may raise money by the sale of our equity securities or debt  or the exercise of outstanding stock options by the holders of such options 
however  given uncertain market conditions and the volatility of our stock price  we may not be able to sell our securities in public offerings or private placements at prices and on terms that are favorable to us  if at all 
we may also choose to obtain funding through licensing and other contractual agreements 
such arrangements may require us to relinquish our rights to our technologies  products or marketing territories  or to grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
if we fail to obtain adequate funding in a timely manner  or at all  we will be forced to scale back our product development activities or our operations in a manner that will ensure we can discharge our obligations as they come due in the ordinary course of business 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are currently material or reasonably likely to be material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
income taxes as of december   we have net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million which expire in the years through  net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes of approximately million which expire in the years through  federal research and development credit carryforwards of approximately  which expire in the year  and state research and development carryforwards of approximately million  some of which expire in and some of which have no expiration 
the realization of these future tax benefits is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period 
because of our history of operating losses  we believe that these benefits are not currently likely to be realized  and  accordingly  the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards are subject to substantial annual limitations due to ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation will result in the expiration of the net operating losses before utilization 
our deferred tax assets have been adjusted for the expected limitation 
we have no unrecognized tax benefits as of december  we do not anticipate that total unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change prior to december  no interest and penalties expenses were recognized in the statements of operations for the years ended december    and we are subject to income tax examinations for us federal income taxes and state income taxes from forward due to net operating losses in tax years through we are subject to tax examinations in the united kingdom from forward 
we do not anticipate that total unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change prior to december  
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk the functional currency of our subsidiary in the united kingdom is british pounds sterling 
we have certain cash balances  goodwill and other intangible assets  and other assets and liabilities denominated in british pounds sterling
