sales to governmental entities and agencies remained strong in approximately of our sales were to federal  state and local governmental entities and related agencies 
pricing pressure continued to have a significant impact on sales

the office segment is impacted primarily by changes in the canadian dollar 
the studio and coverings segments are impacted primarily by changes in the euro 
looking at the average rates for the year  the canadian dollar was significantly higher while the euro was lower in versus liquidity and capital resources the following table highlights certain key cash flows and capital information pertinent to the discussion that follows in thousands cash provided by operating activities capital expenditures cash used in investing activities purchase of common stock for treasury repayment of revolving credit facilities  net repayment of long term debt payment of dividends proceeds from issuance of common stock cash used in financing activities 
table of contents historically  we have carried significant amounts of debt  and cash generated by operating activities has been used to fund working capital  capital expenditures  repurchase shares and payments of principal and interest under our debt 
our capital expenditures are typically for new product tooling and manufacturing equipment 
these capital expenditures support new products and continuous improvements in our manufacturing processes 
cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in and million in for the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities consisted of million from net income  plus various non cash charges which included a million curtailment benefit and million of unfavorable changes in assets and liabilities 
for the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities consisted of million from net income  plus various non cash charges which included million of non cash expense related to the ineffective portion of the interest rate swaps and a million write off of assets due to restructuring  and million of favorable changes in assets and liabilities 
for the year ended december   we used available cash  including the million of cash from operating activities to repay million of debt  fund million in capital expenditures  fund dividend payments to shareholders totaling million  and to fund working capital 
in  we used available cash  including the million of cash from operating activities to repay million of debt  fund million in capital expenditures  fund dividend payments to shareholders totaling million  and to fund working capital 
the increase in capital expenditures year over year includes expenditures on infrastructure related to information technology as we have begun to implement a new enterprise resource planning system in we use our revolving credit facility in the ordinary course of business to fund our working capital needs and  at times  make significant borrowings and repayments under the facility depending on our cash needs and availability at such time 
this facility was amended and restated on february  and matures in february and provides for a revolving credit line of up to million  but includes the option to increase the size of the facility by up to an additional million  subject to the satisfaction of certain terms and conditions 
as of december   there was approximately million outstanding under the facility  compared to million outstanding under the facility as of december  borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be repaid at any time  but no later than february on february   the company completed an amendment to its existing credit facility  dated june   whereby the existing credit agreement was amended and restated in its entirety 
see note of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k and our current report on form k filed with the securities and exchange commission on february  for further information regarding this amendment 
our revolving credit facility requires that we comply with two financial covenants our consolidated leverage ratio  defined as the ratio of total indebtedness to consolidated ebitda as defined in our credit agreement for a period of four fiscal quarters  cannot exceed to  and our consolidated interest coverage ratio  defined as the ratio of our consolidated ebitda as defined in our credit agreement for a period of four fiscal quarters to our consolidated interest expense  must be a minimum of to we are also required to comply with various other affirmative and negative covenants  including without limitation  covenants that prevent or restrict our ability to pay dividends  engage in certain mergers or acquisitions  make certain investments or loans  incur future indebtedness  make significant capital expenditures  engage in sale leaseback transactions  alter our capital structure or line of business  prepay subordinated indebtedness  engage in certain transactions with affiliates and sell stock or assets 
we are currently in compliance with all of the covenants and conditions under our credit facility 
we believe that existing cash balances and internally generated cash flows  together with borrowings available under our revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to fund normal working capital needs  
table of contents capital spending requirements  debt service requirements and dividend payments for at least the next twelve months 
however  because of the financial covenants mentioned above  our capacity under our revolving credit facility could be reduced if our trailing consolidated ebitda as defined by our credit agreement would decline due to deteriorating market conditions 
future debt payments may be paid out of cash flows from operations  from future refinancing of our debt or from equity issuances 
however  our ability to make scheduled payments of principal  to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness  to satisfy our other debt obligations and to pay dividends to stockholders will depend upon our future operating performance  which will be affected by general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory  business and other factors beyond our control 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period less than year to years to years more than years total long term debt  c  operating leases purchase commitments pension plan contributions a postretirement benefit plan obligations a total a due to the uncertainty of future cash outflows  contributions to the pension and other post retirement benefit plans subsequent to have been excluded from the table above 
b due to the uncertainty of future cash outflows  uncertain tax positions have been excluded from the table above 
c on february   the company completed an amendment to its existing credit facility  dated june   whereby the existing credit agreement was amended and restated in its entirety 
this amended and restated agreement provides for a million revolving credit facility that matures in five years  with the option to increase the size of the facility by up to an additional million  subject to the satisfaction of certain terms and conditions 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be repaid at any time  but no later than february  contractual obligations for long term debt include principal and interest payments 
interest has been included at the variable rate in effect as of december   as applicable 
environmental matters our past and present business operations and the past and present ownership and operation of manufacturing plants on real property are subject to extensive and changing federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations  including those relating to discharges to air  water and land  the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and the cleanup of properties affected by hazardous substances 
as a result  we are involved from time to time in administrative and judicial proceedings and inquiries relating to environmental matters and could become subject to fines or penalties related thereto 
we cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future  how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted or what environmental conditions may be found to exist 
compliance with more stringent laws or regulations  or stricter interpretation of existing laws  may require additional expenditures by us  some 
table of contents of which may be material 
we have been identified as a potentially responsible party pursuant to the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of cercla for remediation costs associated with waste disposal sites that we previously used 
the remediation costs and our allocated share at some of these cercla sites are unknown 
we may also be subject to claims for personal injury or contribution relating to cercla sites 
we reserve amounts for such matters when expenditures are probable and reasonably estimable 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as a result  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of certain contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from such estimates 
we believe that the critical accounting policies that follow are those policies that require the most judgment  estimation and assumption in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients and dealers to make required payments 
the allowance is determined through an analysis of the aging of accounts receivable and assessments of risk that are based on historical trends and an evaluation of the impact of current and projected economic conditions 
we evaluate the past due status of our trade receivables based on contractual terms of sale 
if the financial condition of our clients and dealers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
accounts receivable are charged off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when we determine that recovery is unlikely 
losses have been consistent with our expectations 
inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
we write down inventory that  in our judgment  is impaired or obsolete 
obsolescence may be caused by the discontinuance of a product line  changes in product material specifications  replacement products in the marketplace and other competitive influences 
goodwill and other intangible assets intangible assets consist of goodwill  trademarks and deferred financing fees 
goodwill is recorded at the amount by which cost exceeds the net assets of acquired businesses  and all other intangible assets are recorded at cost 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually unless indicators of impairment exist 
financing costs that are incurred by us in connection with the issuance of debt are deferred and amortized to interest expense over the life of the underlying indebtedness 
the period of these costs may be shortened if the underlying indebtedness is modified or retired 

table of contents product warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and by material usage and service costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
cost estimates are based on historical product failure rates and identified one time fixes for each specific product category 
warranty cost generally varies in direct relation to sales volume  as such costs tend to be a consistent percentage of revenue 
should actual costs differ from original estimates  the estimated warranty liability would be revised 
employee benefits we are partially self insured for our employee health benefits 
we accrue for employee health benefit obligations based on an actuarial valuation 
the actuarial valuation is based upon historical claims as well as a number of assumptions  including rates of inflation for medical costs  and benefit plan changes 
actual results could be materially different from the estimates used 
pension and other postretirement benefits we sponsor two defined benefit pension plans and two other postretirement benefit plans 
several statistical and other factors  which attempt to anticipate future events  are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans 
key factors include assumptions about the expected rates of return on plan assets  discount rates  and health care cost trend rates  as determined by us  within certain guidelines 
we consider market conditions  including changes in investment returns and interest rates  in making these assumptions 
both the pension plans and the other postretirement benefit plans were modified during the year ended december  participants who had or greater points age plus years of service could elect to stay in the pension plan and accrue additional benefits or receive the company s k match which was reinstated and enhanced as of january  those with less than points were removed from the pension plan and will not accrue any additional benefits 
the company s other postretirement benefit plans are in the process of being eliminated 
as a result of this modification  the company recorded a million curtailment benefit during the year ended december  we determine the expected long term rate of return on plan assets based on aggregating the expected rates of return for each component of the plan s asset mix 
we use historic plan asset returns combined with current market conditions to estimate the rate of return 
the expected rate of return on plan assets is a long term assumption and generally does not change annually 
the discount rate reflects the market rate for high quality fixed income debt instruments as of our annual measurement date and is subject to change each year 
holding all other assumptions constant  a one percentage point increase or decrease in the assumed rate of return on plan assets would decrease or increase net periodic pension expense by approximately million excluding the curtailment benefit 
likewise  a one percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate would decrease or increase net periodic pension expense by approximately million or million excluding the curtailment benefit  respectively 
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses are recognized over the expected remaining service life of the employee group 
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses arise from several factors  including experience and assumption changes with respect to the obligations and from the difference between expected returns and actual returns on plan assets 
these unrecognized gains and losses are systematically recognized as a change in future net periodic pension expense in accordance with the appropriate accounting guidance relating to defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 

table of contents key assumptions we use in determining the amount of the obligation and expense recorded for postretirement benefits other than pensions opeb  under the appropriate accounting guidance  include the assumed discount rate and the assumed rate of increases in future health care costs 
the discount rate we use to determine the obligation for these benefits matches the discount rate used in determining our pension obligations in each year presented 
in estimating the health care cost trend rate  we consider actual health care cost experience  future benefit structures  industry trends and advice from our actuaries 
we assume that the relative increase in health care costs will generally trend downward over the next several years  reflecting assumed increases in efficiency and cost containment initiatives in the health care system 
at december   the expected rate of increase in future health care costs was in determining the benefit obligation for and and in determining the net periodic benefit cost in for medical and prescription drug  respectively 
the rate was then assumed to decrease to an ultimate rate of for and thereafter for the benefit obligation 
increasing the assumed health care cost trend by one percentage point in each year would increase the benefit obligation as of december  by million and increase the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for by approximately million 
decreasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by one percentage point in each year would decrease the benefit obligation as of december  by approximately million and decrease the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for by approximately million 
in accordance with the appropriate accounting guidance  we recognize in our consolidated balance sheet the funded status ie the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation of our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans 
to record the unfunded status of our plans we recorded an additional liability and an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax 
the actuarial assumptions we use in determining our pension and opeb retirement benefits may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates  or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our financial position or results of operations 
commitments and contingencies we establish reserves for the estimated cost of environmental and legal contingencies when such expenditures are probable and reasonably estimable 
a significant amount of judgment and use of estimates is required to quantify our ultimate exposure in these matters 
we engage outside experts as deemed necessary or appropriate to assist in the evaluation of exposure 
from time to time  as information becomes available regarding changes in circumstances for ongoing issues as well as information regarding emerging issues  our potential liability is reassessed and reserve balances are adjusted as necessary 
revisions to our estimates of potential liability  and actual expenditures related to environmental and legal contingencies  could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with the appropriate accounting guidance relating to income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
the appropriate accounting guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be recognized 

table of contents at december   deferred tax liabilities of million exceeded deferred tax assets of million by million 
at december   our deferred tax liabilities of million exceeded deferred tax assets of million by million 
our deferred tax assets at december  and of million and million  respectively  are net of valuation allowances of million and million  respectively 
we have recorded the above valuation allowance primarily for net operating loss carryforwards in foreign tax jurisdictions where we have incurred historical tax losses from operations or acquired tax losses through acquisition  and have determined that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we evaluate on an ongoing basis the realizability of our deferred tax assets and adjust the amount of the allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include our forecast of future taxable income and our assessment of available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance relating to uncertainty in income taxes 
accordingly  we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken  or expected to be taken  in an income tax return 
we recognize interest and penalties  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
interest rate swap agreements we have variable rate debt obligations that are denominated in us dollars 
a change in interest rates impacts the interest incurred and cash paid on our variable rate debt obligations 
we sometimes use interest rate hedge agreements for other than trading purposes in order to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate debt 
in may of  we entered into four interest rate swap agreements in order to manage our interest rate risk 
each agreement hedged a notional amount of million of our revolving credit facility

recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued amendments to guidance regarding the presentation of comprehensive income 
the amendments eliminate the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the amendments require that comprehensive income be presented in either a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in a single continuous statement  the entity would present the components of net income and total net income  the components of other comprehensive income and a total of other comprehensive income  along with the total of comprehensive income in that statement 
in the two statement approach  the entity would present components of net income and total net income in the statement of net income and a statement of other comprehensive income would immediately follow the statement of net income and include the components of other comprehensive income and a total for other comprehensive income  along with a total for comprehensive income 
the amendments also require the entity to present on the face of the financial statements any reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement s where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented 
the amendments do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income  when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassed to net income or the option to present components of other comprehensive income either net of related tax effects or before related tax effects 
the amendments  excluding the specific requirement to present on the face of the financial statements any reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement s where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented which was deferred by the fasb in december  are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  and are to be applied retrospectively 
the company is evaluating its presentation options under asu no 
 however  it does not expect adoption of this guidance to impact the company s consolidated financial statements other than the change in presentation 
in september  the fasb issued amendments to simplify how entities test goodwill for impairment 
under the updated guidance  an entity now has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
if the assessment of qualitative factors leads to a determination that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
however  if an entity concludes otherwise  then the entity is required to perform the first step of the two step impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing it against its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the entity is required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
under the new guidance  an entity can elect to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the first step of the two step goodwill impairment 
the amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted  however the company did not early adopt this amendment
