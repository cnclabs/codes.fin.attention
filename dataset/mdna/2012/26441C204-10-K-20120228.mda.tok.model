duke energy conducts its operations in the following business segments  all of which are considered reportable segments under the applicable accounting rules us franchised electric and gas usfe g  commercial power and international energy 
the remainder of duke energy s operations are presented as other 
duke energy s chief operating decision maker regularly reviews financial information about each of these business segments in deciding how to allocate resources and evaluate performance 
for additional information on each of these business segments  including financial and geographic information about each reportable business segment  see note to the consolidated financial statements  business segments 
us franchised electric and gas service area and customers usfe g generates  transmits  distributes and sells electricity in central and western north carolina  western south carolina  central  north central and southern indiana  and northern kentucky 
usfe g also transmits  distributes and sells electricity in southwestern ohio 
additionally  usfe g transports and sells natural gas in southwestern ohio and northern kentucky 
it conducts operations primarily through duke energy carolinas  the regulated transmission and distribution operations of duke energy ohio  including duke energy kentucky  and duke energy indiana duke energy ohio  duke energy indiana and duke energy kentucky collectively referred to as duke energy midwest 
these electric and gas operations are subject to the rules and regulations of the ferc  the ncuc  the pscsc  the public utilities commission of ohio puco  the indiana utility regulatory commission iurc and the kpsc 
the substantial majority of usfe g s operations are regulated and  accordingly  these operations qualify for regulatory accounting treatment 
its service area covers  square miles with an estimated population of million 
usfe g supplies electric service to four million residential  general service and industrial customers 
usfe g provides regulated transmission and distribution services for natural gas to  customers in southwestern ohio and northern kentucky 
electricity is also sold wholesale to incorporated municipalities  electric cooperative utilities and other load serving entities 
duke energy carolinas service area has a diversified general service and industrial presence 
manufacturing continues to be an important contributor to the region s economy  along with financial  professional and business services 
other sectors such as trade  health care  local government and education also constitute key components of the states gross domestic product 
chemicals  computers and electronics  rubber and plastics  textile  paper and motor vehicle manufacturing industries were among the most significant contributors to the duke energy carolinas industrial sales revenue for duke energy ohio s service area has a diversified general service and industrial customer base 
major components of the manufacturing sector include aerospace and motor vehicles  metals  chemicals and food 
other sectors include real estate and rental leasing  financial and insurance services  healthcare and wholesale trade services 
these are among the primary contributors to duke energy ohio s industrial and general service sales revenue for for duke energy indiana  a significant portion of the service territory s economic output is driven by manufacturing 
chemicals  transportation equipment  machinery and metal industries were the primary contributors 
other sectors include retail trade  government  financial  health care and education services 
duke energy indiana s industrial and general service sales were concentrated in the aforementioned sectors 
the number of residential  general service and industrial customers within the usfe g service territory  as well as sales to these customers  is expected to increase over time 
however  growth in the near term is being hampered by the current economic conditions 
industrial sales increased modestly in when compared to  however  the growth rate was lower than in previous comparable periods 
seasonality and the impact of weather usfe g s costs and revenues are influenced by seasonal patterns 
peak sales of electricity occur during the summer and winter months  resulting in higher revenue and cash flows during those periods 
by contrast  fewer sales of electricity occur during the spring and fall  allowing for scheduled plant maintenance during those periods 
peak gas sales occur during the winter months 
residential and commercial customers are most impacted by weather 
industrial customers are less weather sensitive 
normal weather conditions are defined as the long term average of actual historical weather conditions 
the estimated impact of weather on earnings is based on the number of customers  temperature variances from a normal condition and customer s historic usage levels and patterns 
the methodology used to estimate the impact of weather does not and cannot consider all variables that may impact customer response to weather conditions such as humidity and relative temperature changes 
the precision of this estimate may also be impacted by applying long term weather trends to shorter term periods 
competition usfe g s regulated utility business operates as the sole supplier of electricity within certain service territories 
it owns and operates all of the businesses and facilities necessary to generate  transmit and distribute electricity 
services are priced by state commission approved rates designed to include the costs of providing these services and a reasonable return on invested capital 
this regulatory policy is intended to provide safe and reliable electricity at fair prices 
usfe g s competition in the regulated electric distribution business is primarily from the on site generation of industrial customers 
usfe g also competes with other utilities and marketers in the wholesale electric business 
the principal factors in competing for wholesale sales are price including fuel costs  availability of capacity and power and reliability of service 
wholesale electric prices are influenced primarily by market conditions and fuel costs 
energy capacity and resources for information on usfe g s generation facilities  see us franchised electric and gas in item properties 
electric energy for usfe g s customers is generated by three nuclear generating stations with a combined owned capacity of  megawatt mw including duke energy s ownership in the catawba nuclear station  coal fired stations with an overall combined owned capacity of  mw including duke energy s ownership in the east bend steam station and ownership in unit of the gibson steam station  hydroelectric stations including two pumped storage facilities with a combined owned capacity of  mw  combustion turbine ct stations burning natural gas  oil or other fuels with an overall combined owned capacity of  mw  and two combined cycle cc stations burning natural gas with an owned capacity of mw 
in addition  usfe g operates a solar distributed generation program with mw of capacity 
energy and capacity are also supplied through contracts with other generators and purchased on the open market 
factors that could cause usfe g to purchase power for its customers include generating plant outages  extreme weather conditions  generation reliability during the summer  growth  and price 
usfe g has interconnections and arrangements with its neighboring utilities to facilitate planning  emergency assistance  sale and purchase of capacity and energy  and reliability of power supply 

table of contents part i usfe g s generation portfolio is a balanced mix of energy resources having different operating characteristics and fuel sources designed to provide energy at the lowest possible cost to meet its obligation to serve native load customers 
all options  including owned generation resources and purchased power opportunities  are continually evaluated on a real time basis to select and dispatch the lowest cost resources available to meet system load requirements 
the vast majority of customer energy needs have historically been met by large  low energy production cost nuclear and coal fired generating units that operated almost continuously or at baseload levels 
however  recent commodity pricing trends have resulted in more combined cycle gas fired generation 
hydroelectric both conventional and pumped storage facilities in the carolinas and gas oil ct and cc stations in both the carolinas and midwest operate primarily during the peak hour load periods when customer loads are rapidly changing 
ct s and cc s are less expensive to build and maintain than either nuclear or coal  and can be rapidly started or stopped as needed to meet changing customer loads or operated as base load units depending on commodity prices 
hydroelectric units produce low cost energy  but their operations are limited by the availability of water flow 
usfe g s pumped storage hydroelectric facilities offer the added flexibility of using low cost off peak energy to pump water that will be stored for later generation use during times of higher cost on peak periods 
these facilities allow usfe g to maximize the value spreads between different high and low cost generation periods 
usfe g is engaged in planning efforts to meet projected load growth in its service territories 
long term projections indicate a need for capacity additions  which may include new nuclear  integrated gasification combined cycle igcc  coal facilities  gas fired generation units or renewable energy facilities 
because of the long lead times required to develop such assets  usfe g is taking steps now to ensure those options are available 
significant current or potential future capital projects are discussed below 
in  north carolina and south carolina passed energy legislation which includes provisions to provide assurance of cost recovery  subject to prudency review  related to a utility s incurrence of project development costs associated with nuclear baseload generation  cost recovery assurance for construction costs associated with nuclear or coal baseload generation  and the ability to recover financing costs for new nuclear baseload generation in rates during construction 
william states lee iii nuclear station in december  duke energy carolinas filed an application with the nrc  which has been docketed for review  for a combined construction and operating license col for two westinghouse ap advanced passive reactors for the proposed william states lee iii nuclear station lee nuclear station at a site in cherokee county  south carolina 
each reactor is capable of producing  mw 
submitting the col application does not commit duke energy carolinas to build nuclear units 
through several separate orders  the ncuc and pscsc have allowed duke energy to incur project development and pre construction costs for the project through june   and up to an aggregate maximum amount of million 
as a condition to the approval of continued development of the project  duke energy carolinas shall provide certain monthly reports to the pscsc and the office of regulatory staff ors 
duke energy carolinas has also agreed to provide a monthly report to certain parties on the progress of negotiations to acquire an interest in the vc summer nuclear station expansion being developed by south carolina public service authority santee cooper and south carolina electric gas company 
any change in ownership interest  output allocation  sharing of costs or control and any future option agreements concerning lee nuclear station shall be subject to prior approval of the pscsc 
the nrc review of the col application continues and the estimated receipt of the col is in mid duke energy carolinas filed with the department of energy doe for a federal loan guarantee  which has the potential to significantly lower financing costs associated with the proposed lee nuclear station  however  it was not among the four projects selected by the doe for the final phase of due diligence for the federal loan guarantee program 
the project could be selected in the future if the program funding is expanded or if any of the current finalists drop out of the program 
duke energy carolinas is seeking partners for lee nuclear station by issuing options to purchase an ownership interest in the plant 
in the first quarter of  duke energy carolinas entered into an agreement with jea that provides jea with an option to purchase up to a undivided ownership interest in lee nuclear station 
jea has days following duke energy carolinas receipt of the col to exercise the option 
duke energy carolinas vc summer nuclear station letter of intent 
in july  duke energy carolinas signed a letter of intent with santee cooper related to the potential acquisition by duke energy carolinas of a five percent to ten percent ownership interest in the vc summer nuclear station being developed by santee cooper and sce g near jenkinsville  south carolina 
the letter of intent provides a path for duke energy carolinas to conduct the necessary due diligence to determine if future participation in this project is beneficial for its customers 
cliffside unit on march   the ncuc issued an order allowing duke energy carolinas to build an mw coal fired unit 
following final equipment selection and the completion of detailed engineering  cliffside unit is expected to have a net output of mw 
on january   duke energy carolinas filed its updated cost estimate of billion excluding allowance for funds used during construction afudc of million for the approved new cliffside unit in march  duke energy carolinas filed an updated cost estimate of billion excluding afudc with the ncuc where it reduced the estimated afudc financing costs to million as a result of the december rate case settlement with the ncuc that allowed the inclusion of construction work in progress in rate base prospectively 
duke energy carolinas believes that the overall cost of cliffside unit will be reduced by million in federal advanced clean coal tax credits 
the cliffside unit project is approximately complete as of december  and is currently anticipated to be completed and in service in dan river and buck combined cycle facilities 
in june  the ncuc issued its order approving the certificate of public convenience and necessity cpcn applications to construct a mw combined cycle natural gas fired generating facility at each of duke energy carolinas existing dan river steam station and buck steam station 
the division of air quality daq issued a final air permit authorizing construction of the buck and dan river combined cycle natural gas fired generating units in october and august  respectively 
based on the most updated cost estimates  total costs including afudc for the buck and dan river projects are million and million  respectively 
in november  duke energy carolinas placed the buck combined cycle natural gas fired generation facility in service 
the dan river project is approximately complete as of december   and expected to be placed into service by the end of edwardsport igcc 
in september  duke energy indiana and southern indiana gas and electric company d b a vectren energy delivery of indiana vectren filed a joint petition with the iurc seeking a cpcn for the construction of a mw igcc power plant at duke energy indiana s edwardsport generating station in knox county  indiana 
the facility was initially estimated to cost approximately billion including million of afudc 
in august  vectren formally withdrew its participation in the igcc plant and a hearing was conducted on the cpcn petition based on duke energy indiana owning of the project 
on november   the iurc issued an order granting duke energy indiana a cpcn for the proposed igcc project  approved the cost estimate of billion and approved the timely recovery of costs related to the project 
on january   duke energy indiana received the final air permit from the indiana department of environmental management 
the citizens action coalition of indiana  inc cac  sierra club  inc  save the valley  inc  and valley watch  inc  all intervenors in the cpcn proceeding  have appealed the air permit 

table of contents part i on may   duke energy indiana filed its first semi annual igcc rider and ongoing review proceeding with the iurc as required under the cpcn order issued by the iurc 
in its filing  duke energy indiana requested approval of a new cost estimate for the igcc project of billion including million of afudc and for approval of plans to study carbon capture as required by the iurc s cpcn order 
on january   the iurc approved duke energy indiana s request  including the new cost estimate of billion  and cost recovery associated with a study on carbon capture 
duke energy indiana was required to file its plans for studying carbon storage related to the project within days of the order 
on november  and may   duke energy indiana filed its second and third semi annual igcc riders  respectively  both of which were approved by the iurc in full 
on november   duke energy indiana filed a petition for its fourth semi annual igcc rider and ongoing review proceeding with the iurc 
as duke energy indiana experienced design modifications  quantity increases and scope growth above what was anticipated from the preliminary engineering design  capital costs to the igcc project were anticipated to increase 
duke energy indiana forecasted that the additional capital cost items would use the remaining contingency and escalation amounts in the current billion cost estimate and add million  excluding the impact associated with the need to add more contingency 
duke energy indiana did not request approval of an increased cost estimate in the fourth semi annual update proceeding  rather  duke energy indiana requested  and the iurc approved  a subdocket proceeding in which duke energy indiana would present additional evidence regarding an updated estimated cost for the igcc project and in which a more comprehensive review of the igcc project could occur 
an interim order was received on july  and approves implementation of an updated igcc rider to recover costs incurred through september  the approvals are on an interim basis pending the outcome of the sub docket proceeding involving the revised cost estimate as discussed further below 
on april   duke energy indiana filed a revised cost estimate for the igcc project reflecting an estimated cost increase of million 
duke energy indiana requested approval of the new cost estimate of billion including million of afudc and for continuation of the existing cost recovery treatment 
a major driver of the cost increase included quantity increases and design changes  which impacted the scope  productivity and schedule of the igcc project 
on september  an agreement was reached with the indiana office of utility consumer counselor oucc  duke energy indiana industrial group and nucor steel indiana to increase the authorized cost estimate of billion to billion  and to cap the project s costs that could be passed on to customers at billion 
any construction cost amounts above billion will be subject to a prudence review similar to most other rate base investments in duke energy indiana s next general rate increase request before the iurc 
duke energy indiana agreed to accept a basis point reduction in the equity return for any project construction costs greater than billion 
additionally  duke energy indiana agreed not to file for a general rate case increase before march duke energy indiana also agreed to reduce depreciation rates earlier than would otherwise be required and to forego a deferred tax incentive related to the igcc project 
as a result of the settlement  duke energy indiana recorded a pre tax charge to earnings of million in the third quarter of to reflect the impact of the reduction in the return on equity 
due to the iurc investigation discussed below  the iurc convened a technical conference on november   related to the continuing need for the edwardsport igcc facility 
on december   the parties to the settlement withdrew the settlement agreement to provide an opportunity for the parties to the settlement to assess whether and to what extent the settlement agreement remained a reasonable allocation of risks and rewards and whether modifications to the settlement agreement were appropriate 
the iurc granted the motion and scheduled a new evidentiary hearing to begin march  management determined that the million charge discussed above was not impacted by the withdrawal of the settlement agreement 
during  duke energy indiana filed petitions for its fifth and sixth semi annual igcc riders 
evidentiary hearings are set for april   respectively 
the citizens action coalition of indiana  inc cac  sierra club  inc  save the valley  inc  and valley watch  inc 
filed motions for two subdocket proceedings alleging improper circumstances  undue influence  fraud  concealment and gross mismanagement  and a request for field hearing in this proceeding 
duke energy indiana opposed the requests 
on february   the iurc issued an order which denied the request for a subdocket to investigate the allegations of improper communications and undue influence at this time  finding there were other agencies better suited for such investigation 
the iurc also found that allegations of fraud  concealment and gross mismanagement related to the igcc project should be heard in a phase ii proceeding of the cost estimate subdocket and set evidentiary hearings on both phase i cost estimate increase and phase ii beginning in august after procedural delays  hearings for phase i began on october  and for phase ii hearings begin on november  on march   duke energy indiana filed testimony with the iurc proposing a framework designed to mitigate customer rate impacts associated with the edwardsport igcc project 
duke energy indiana s filing proposed a cap on the project s construction costs  excluding financing costs  which can be recovered through rates at billion 
it also proposed rate related adjustments that will lower the overall customer rate increase related to the project from an average of to approximately 
the proposal is subject to the approval of the iurc in the phase i hearings 
on june   duke energy indiana filed testimony with the iurc in connection with its seventh semi annual rider request which included an update on the current cost forecast of the edwardsport igcc project 
the updated forecast excluding afudc increased from billion to billion  not including any contingency for unexpected start up events 
on june   the oucc and intervenors filed testimony in phase i recommending that duke energy indiana be disallowed cost recovery of any of the additional cost estimate increase above the previously approved cost estimate of billion 
duke energy indiana filed rebuttal testimony on august  on november   duke energy indiana filed a petition with the iurc in connection with its eight semi annual rider request for the edwardsport project 
evidentiary hearings for the seventh and eighth semi annual rider requests are scheduled for august and august  in the subdocket proceeding on july   the oucc and certain intervenors filed testimony in phase ii alleging that duke energy indiana concealed information and grossly mismanaged the project  and therefore duke energy indiana should only be permitted to recover from customers billion  the original igcc project cost estimate approved by the iurc 
other intervenors recommended that duke energy indiana not be able to rely on any cost recovery granted under the cpcn or the first cost increase order 
duke energy indiana believes it has diligently and prudently managed the project 
on september   duke energy defended against the allegations in its responsive testimony 
the oucc and intervenors filed their final rebuttal testimony in phase ii on or before october   making similar claims of fraud  concealment and gross mismanagement and recommending the same outcome of limiting duke energy indiana s recovery to the billion initial cost estimate 
additionally  the cac parties recommended that recovery be limited to the costs incurred on the igcc project as of november  duke energy indiana estimates it had committed costs of billion  with further iurc proceedings to be held to determine the financial consequences of this recommendation 
on october   duke energy revised its project cost estimate from approximately billion  excluding financing costs  to approximately billion  excluding financing costs 
the revised estimate reflects additional cost pressures resulting from quantity increase and the resulting impact on the scope  productivity and schedule of the igcc project 
duke energy indiana previously proposed to the iurc a cost cap of approximately billion  plus the actual afudc that accrues on that amount 
as a result  duke energy indiana recorded a pre tax impairment charge of approximately million in the third quarter of related to costs expected to be incurred above the cost cap 
this charge is in addition to a pre tax impairment charge of approximately million recorded in the third quarter of as discussed above 
the cost cap  if approved by the iurc  limits the amount of project construction costs that may be incorporated into customer rates in 
table of contents part i indiana 
as a result of the proposed cost cap  recovery of these cost increases is not considered probable 
additional updates to the cost estimate could occur through the completion of the plant in phase i and phase ii hearings concluded on january  final orders from the iurc on phase i and phase ii of the subdocket and the pending igcc rider proceedings are expected no sooner than the end of the third quarter duke energy is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these proceedings 
in the event the iurc disallows a portion of the plant costs  including financing costs  or if cost estimates for the plant increase  additional charges to expense  which could be material  could occur 
the edwardsport igcc facility is approximately complete as of december  and is expected to be completed and placed in service in duke energy indiana carbon sequestration 
duke energy indiana filed a petition with the iurc requesting approval of its plans for studying carbon storage  sequestration and or enhanced oil recovery for the carbon dioxide co from the edwardsport igcc facility on march  on july   duke energy indiana filed its case in chief testimony requesting approval for cost recovery of a million site assessment and characterization plan for co sequestration options including deep saline sequestration  depleted oil and gas sequestration and enhanced oil recovery for the co from the edwardsport igcc facility 
the oucc filed testimony supportive of the continuing study of carbon storage  but recommended that duke energy indiana break its plan into phases  recommending approval of only million in expenditures at this time and deferral of expenditures rather than cost recovery through a tracking mechanism as proposed by duke energy indiana 
the cac  an intervenor  recommended against approval of the carbon storage plan stating customers should not be required to pay for research and development costs 
duke energy indiana s rebuttal testimony was filed october   wherein it amended its request to seek deferral of million to cover the carbon storage site assessment and characterization activities scheduled to occur through the end of  with further required study expenditures subject to future iurc proceedings 
an evidentiary hearing was held on november  see note to the consolidated financial statements  regulatory matters  for further discussion on the above in process or potential construction projects 
duke energy generating facility retirements 
duke energy carolinas  duke energy indiana  duke energy ohio and duke energy kentucky each periodically file integrated resource plans irp with their state regulatory commissions 
the irps provide a view of forecasted energy needs over a long term years  and options being considered to meet those needs 
the irp s filed by duke energy carolinas  duke energy indiana  duke energy ohio and duke energy kentucky in and included planning assumptions to potentially retire  by  certain coal fired generating facilities in north carolina  south carolina  indiana  ohio and kentucky that do not have the requisite emission control equipment  primarily to meet epa regulations that are not yet effective 
these facilities total approximately  mw at eight sites dan river  riverbend  lee  buck units and  wabash river  gallagher  beckjord and miami fort unit 
duke energy continues to evaluate the potential need to retire these coal fired generating facilities earlier than the current estimated useful lives  and plans to seek regulatory recovery for amounts that would not be otherwise recovered when any assets are retired 
fuel supply usfe g relies principally on coal and nuclear fuel for its generation of electric energy 
the following table lists usfe g s sources of power and fuel costs for the three years ended december  generation by source percent cost of delivered fuel per net kilowatt hour generated cents d d d d coal a nuclear oil and gas b all fuels cost based on weighted average a hydroelectric c a statistics related to coal generation and all fuels reflect usfe g s ownership interest in the east bend steam station and ownership interest in unit of the gibson steam station 
b cost statistics include amounts for light off fuel at usfe g s coal fired stations and combined cycle gas only 
c generating figures are net of output required to replenish pumped storage facilities during off peak periods 
d in addition  duke energy carolinas produced approximately  megawatt hours mwh in solar generation for and  no fuel costs are attributed to this generation 
coal 
usfe g meets its coal demand in the carolinas and midwest through a portfolio of long term purchase contracts and short term spot market purchase agreements 
large amounts of coal are purchased under long term contracts with mining operators who mine both underground and at the surface 
usfe g uses spot market purchases to meet coal requirements not met by long term contracts 
expiration dates for its long term contracts  which have various price adjustment provisions and market re openers  range from to for the carolinas and to for the midwest 
usfe g expects to renew these contracts or enter into similar contracts with other suppliers for the quantities and quality of coal required as existing contracts expire  though prices will fluctuate over time as coal markets change 
the coal purchased for the carolinas is primarily produced from mines in eastern kentucky  west virginia and southwestern virginia 
the coal purchased for the regulated midwest entities is primarily produced in indiana  illinois  and kentucky 
usfe g has an adequate supply of coal under contract to fuel its projected operations and a significant portion of supply to fuel its projected operations 
coal inventory levels have increased during the past year due to the impact of mild weather and the economy on retail load and low natural gas prices which are resulting in higher combined cycle gas fired generation 
if these factors continue for an extended period of time  usfe g could have excess levels of coal inventory or incur incremental purchased power or other costs 

table of contents part i the current average sulfur content of coal purchased by usfe g for the carolinas is between and  while the midwest is between and 
usfe g s scrubbers  in combination with the use of sulfur dioxide so emission allowances  enable usfe g to satisfy current so emission limitations for existing facilities in the carolinas and midwest 
gas 
usfe g is responsible for the purchase and the subsequent delivery of natural gas to native load customers in its ohio and kentucky service territories 
usfe g s natural gas procurement strategy is to buy firm natural gas supplies natural gas intended to be available at all times and firm interstate pipeline transportation capacity during the winter season november through march and during the non heating season april through october through a combination of firm supply and transportation capacity along with spot supply and interruptible transportation capacity 
this strategy allows usfe g to assure reliable natural gas supply for its high priority non curtailable firm customers during peak winter conditions and provides usfe g the flexibility to reduce its contract commitments if firm customers choose alternate gas suppliers under usfe g customer choice gas transportation programs 
in  firm supply purchase commitment agreements provided approximately of the natural gas supply 
these firm supply agreements feature two levels of gas supply  specifically i 
base load  which is a continuous supply to meet normal demand requirements  and ii 
swing load  which is gas available on a daily basis to accommodate changes in demand due primarily to changing weather conditions 
usfe g also owns two underground caverns with a total storage capacity of million gallons of liquid propane 
in addition  usfe g has access to million gallons of liquid propane storage and product loan through a commercial services agreement with a third party 
this liquid propane is used in the three propane air peak shaving plants located in ohio and kentucky 
propane air peak shaving plants vaporize the propane and mix it with natural gas to supplement the natural gas supply during peak demand periods 
usfe g maintains natural gas procurement price volatility mitigation programs for duke energy ohio and duke energy kentucky 
these programs pre arrange percentages of seasonal gas requirements for duke energy ohio and duke energy kentucky 
duke energy ohio and duke energy kentucky use primarily fixed price forward contracts and contracts with a ceiling and floor on the price 
as of december   duke energy ohio and duke energy kentucky  combined  had locked in pricing for of their winter system load requirements 
usfe g is also responsible for the purchase and the subsequent delivery of natural gas to the gas turbine generators to serve native electric load customers in the duke energy carolinas  duke energy indiana and duke energy kentucky service territories 
the natural gas procurement strategy is to contract with one or several suppliers who buy spot market natural gas supplies along with firm or interruptible interstate pipeline transportation capacity for deliveries to the sites 
this strategy allows for competitive pricing  flexibility of delivery  and reliable natural gas supplies to each of the natural gas plants 
in addition  duke energy carolinas entered into a year contract for firm capacity to serve a portion of the buck and dan river facilities 
many of the natural gas plants can be served by several supply zones and multiple pipelines 
nuclear 
the industrial processes for producing nuclear generating fuel generally involve the mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates  the services to convert uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride  the services to enrich the uranium hexafluoride  and the services to fabricate the enriched uranium hexafluoride into usable fuel assemblies 
duke energy carolinas has contracted for uranium materials and services to fuel the oconee  mcguire and catawba nuclear stations in the carolinas 
uranium concentrates  conversion services and enrichment services are primarily met through a diversified portfolio of long term supply contracts 
the contracts are diversified by supplier  country of origin and pricing 
duke energy carolinas staggers its contracting so that its portfolio of long term contracts covers the majority of its fuel requirements at oconee  mcguire and catawba in the near term and decreasing portions of its fuel requirements over time thereafter 
near term requirements not met by long term supply contracts have been and are expected to be fulfilled with spot market purchases 
due to the technical complexities of changing suppliers of fuel fabrication services  duke energy carolinas generally sources these services to a single domestic supplier on a plant by plant basis using multi year contracts 
duke energy carolinas has entered into fuel contracts that  based on its current need projections  cover of the uranium concentrates  conversion services  and enrichment services requirements of the oconee  mcguire and catawba nuclear stations through at least and cover fabrication services requirements for these plants through at least for subsequent years  a portion of the fuel requirements at oconee  mcguire and catawba are covered by long term contracts 
for future requirements not already covered under long term contracts  duke energy carolinas believes it will be able to renew contracts as they expire  or enter into similar contractual arrangements with other suppliers of nuclear fuel materials and services 
energy efficiency 
several factors have led to increased focus on energy efficiency  including environmental constraints  increasing costs of generating plants and legislative mandates regarding building codes and appliance efficiencies 
as a result of these factors  duke energy has developed various programs designed to promote the efficient use of electricity by its customers 
these programs and associated compensation mechanisms have been filed with various state commissions over the past several years 
in february  the ncuc approved duke energy carolinas energy efficiency programs and authorized duke energy carolinas to implement its rate rider pending approval of a final compensation mechanism by the ncuc

renewable energy 
concerns of climate change and energy security  carbon emissions and a desire to stimulate energy related to economic development have resulted in rising government support of renewable energy legislation at both the federal and state level 
for example  the north carolina legislation sb established a renewable energy and energy efficiency portfolio standard reps for electric utilities  and in  the state of ohio also passed legislation that included renewable energy and advanced energy targets 
with the passage of senate bill sb in ohio in  duke energy ohio is required to secure renewable energy and include an increasing percentage of renewables as part of its resource portfolio 
the compliance percentages are based on a three year historical average of its standard service offer load 
the requirements begin at of the baseline load from all renewable resources  including to be specifically from solar beginning in  increasing to total renewable  with from solar by of these percentages  at least of each resource type must come from resources located within the state of ohio 
to address this legislation  duke energy ohio initiated several acquisition activities focused on meeting the specific near term  and requirements 
effective december   the puco adopted a set of reporting standards known as green rules which will regulate energy efficiency  alternative energy generation requirements and emission reporting for activities mandated by sb the north carolina reps was enacted in as part of sb and became effective january  sb requires that renewable energy must equal of retail sales beginning in and increases to by a portion of the requirement may be met through energy efficiency programs less than until and less than thereafter 
a portion may also be met through purchases of unbundled out of state renewable energy credits less than 
duke energy carolinas recovers the majority of costs associated with renewable compliance through rate rider regulatory recovery  these costs apply only to north carolina customers 
reps rider charges are statutorily capped in order to limit the impact of renewable compliance costs on customers and spending beyond the cost cap is not required 
the indiana state legislature passed senate bill in  establishing a voluntary portfolio standard 
iurc rulemaking is underway with final rules expected mid duke energy carolinas expects to be deemed in full compliance with these requirements in  subject to ncuc order  and duke energy ohio also expects to be in full compliance with these requirements in inventory generation of electricity is capital intensive 
usfe g must maintain an adequate stock of fuel  materials and supplies in order to ensure continuous operation of generating facilities and reliable delivery to customers

risk factors 
unless otherwise indicated  the risk factors discussed below generally relate to risks associated with all of the duke energy registrants 
risks identified at the subsidiary registrant level are generally applicable to duke energy 
the duke energy registrants franchised electric revenues  earnings and results are dependent on state legislation and regulation that affect electric generation  transmission  distribution and related activities  which may limit duke energy s ability to recover costs 
the duke energy registrants franchised electric businesses are regulated on a cost of service rate of return basis subject to the statutes and regulatory commission rules and procedures of north carolina  south carolina  ohio  indiana and kentucky 
if the duke energy registrants franchised electric earnings exceed the returns established by the state regulatory commissions  the duke energy registrants retail electric rates may be subject to review and possible reduction by the commissions  which may decrease the duke energy registrants future earnings 
additionally  if regulatory bodies do not allow recovery of costs incurred in providing service on a timely basis  the duke energy registrants future earnings could be negatively impacted 
if legislative and regulatory structures were to evolve in such a way that the duke energy registrants exclusive rights to serve their franchised customers were eroded  the duke energy registrants future earnings could be negatively impacted 
the duke energy registrants businesses are subject to extensive federal regulation that will affect the duke energy registrants operations and costs 
the duke energy registrants are subject to regulation by ferc  the nrc and various other federal agencies 
regulation affects almost every aspect of the duke energy registrants businesses  including  among other things  the duke energy registrants ability to take fundamental business management actions  determine the terms and rates of the duke energy registrants transmission and distribution businesses services  make acquisitions  issue equity or debt securities  engage in transactions between the duke energy registrants utilities and other subsidiaries and affiliates  and the ability of the operating subsidiaries to pay dividends to the duke energy registrants 
changes to these regulations are ongoing  and the duke energy registrants cannot predict the future course of changes in this regulatory environment or the ultimate effect that this changing regulatory environment will have on the duke energy registrants business 
however  changes in regulation including re regulating previously deregulated markets can cause delays in or affect business planning and transactions and can substantially increase the duke energy registrants costs 
the duke energy registrants must meet credit quality standards and there is no assurance that they and their rated subsidiaries will maintain investment grade credit ratings 
if the duke energy registrants or their rated subsidiaries are unable to maintain an investment grade credit rating  the duke energy registrants would be required under credit agreements to provide collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash  which may materially adversely affect the duke energy registrants liquidity 
each of the duke energy registrants and their rated subsidiaries senior unsecured long term debt is currently rated investment grade by various rating agencies 
the duke energy registrants cannot be sure that the senior unsecured long term debt of the duke energy registrants or their rated subsidiaries will be rated investment grade in the future 
if the rating agencies were to rate the duke energy registrants or their rated subsidiaries below investment grade  the entities borrowing costs would increase  perhaps significantly 
in addition  their potential pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease 
further  if the duke energy registrants short term debt rating were to fall  the entities access to the commercial paper market could be significantly limited 
any downgrade or other event negatively affecting the credit ratings of the duke energy registrants subsidiaries could make their costs of borrowing higher or access to funding sources more limited  which in turn could increase the duke energy registrants need to provide liquidity in the form of capital contributions or loans to such subsidiaries  thus reducing the liquidity and borrowing availability of the consolidated group 
a downgrade below investment grade could also require the duke energy registrants to post additional collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash under various credit agreements and trigger termination clauses in some interest rate derivative agreements  which would require cash payments 
all of these events would likely reduce the duke energy registrants liquidity and profitability and could have a material adverse effect on the duke energy registrants financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
duke energy relies on access to short term money markets and longer term capital markets to finance duke energy s capital requirements and support duke energy s liquidity needs  and duke energy s access to those markets can be adversely affected by a number of conditions  many of which are beyond duke energy s control 
duke energy s business is financed to a large degree through debt and the maturity and repayment profile of debt used to finance investments often does not correlate to cash flows from duke energy s assets 
accordingly  duke energy relies on access to both short term money markets and longer term capital markets as a source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from duke energy s operations and to fund investments originally financed through debt instruments with disparate maturities 
if duke energy is not able to access capital at competitive rates or at all  duke energy s ability to finance its operations and implement its strategy and business plan as scheduled could be adversely affected 
an inability to access capital may limit duke energy s ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions that duke energy may otherwise rely on for future growth 
market disruptions may increase duke energy s cost of borrowing or adversely affect duke energy s ability to access one or more financial markets 
such disruptions could include economic downturns  the bankruptcy of an unrelated energy company  capital market conditions generally  market prices for electricity and gas  terrorist attacks or threatened attacks on duke energy s facilities or unrelated energy companies  or the overall health of the energy industry 
the availability of credit under duke energy s revolving credit facilities depends upon the ability of the banks providing commitments under such facilities to provide funds when their obligations to do so arise 
systematic risk of the banking system and the financial markets could prevent a bank from meeting its obligations under the facility 
duke energy maintains revolving credit facilities to provide back up for commercial paper programs and or letters of credit at various entities 
these facilities typically include borrowing sublimits for certain subsidiaries and financial covenants which limit the amount of debt that can be outstanding as a percentage of the total capital for the specific entity 
failure to maintain these covenants at a particular entity could preclude duke energy from issuing commercial paper or duke energy and the particular entity from issuing letters of credit or borrowing under the revolving credit facility 
additionally  failure to comply with these financial covenants could result in duke energy being required to immediately pay down any outstanding amounts under other revolving credit agreements 
the subsidiary registrants rely on access to short term intercompany borrowings and longer term capital markets to finance the subsidiary registrants capital requirements and support their liquidity needs  and the subsidiary registrants access to those markets can be adversely affected by a number of conditions  many of which are beyond the subsidiary registrants control 
the subsidiary registrants businesses are financed to a large degree through debt and the maturity and repayment profile of debt used to finance investments often does not correlate to cash flows from the subsidiary registrants assets 
accordingly  the subsidiary registrants rely on access to short term borrowings via duke energy s money pool arrangement and financings from longer term capital markets as a source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from its operations and to fund investments originally financed through debt instruments with disparate maturities 
if the subsidiary registrants are not able to access capital at competitive rates 
table of contents part i or the subsidiary registrants cannot obtain short term borrowings via the money pool arrangement  their ability to finance their operations and implement their strategy could be adversely affected 
market disruptions may increase the subsidiary registrants cost of borrowing or adversely affect the subsidiary registrants ability to access one or more financial markets 
such disruptions could include economic downturns  the bankruptcy of an unrelated energy company  capital market conditions generally  market prices for electricity and gas  terrorist attacks or threatened attacks on the subsidiary registrants facilities or unrelated energy companies  or the overall health of the energy industry 
restrictions on the subsidiary registrants ability to access financial markets may also affect its ability to execute its business plan as scheduled 
an inability to access capital may limit the subsidiary registrants ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions that it may otherwise rely on for future growth 
the availability of credit under duke energy s revolving credit facilities depends upon the ability of the banks providing commitments under such facilities to provide funds when their obligations to do so arise 
systematic risk of the banking system and the financial markets could prevent a bank from meeting its obligations under the facility agreement 
the subsidiary registrants ultimate parent  duke energy  maintains revolving credit facilities to provide back up for commercial paper programs and or letters of credit at various entities 
these facilities typically include borrowing sublimits for certain subsidiaries and financial covenants which limit the amount of debt that can be outstanding as a percentage of the total capital for the specific entity 
failure to maintain these covenants at either duke energy or the subsidiary registrants could preclude duke energy or the subsidiary registrants from issuing letters of credit or borrowing under the revolving credit facility 
the duke energy registrants are exposed to credit risk of the customers and counterparties with whom the duke energy registrants do business 
adverse economic conditions affecting  or financial difficulties of  customers and counterparties with whom the duke energy registrants do business could impair the ability of these customers and counterparties to pay for the duke energy registrants services or fulfill their contractual obligations  including loss recovery payments under insurance contracts  or cause them to delay such payments or obligations 
the duke energy registrants depend on these customers and counterparties to remit payments on a timely basis 
any delay or default in payment could adversely affect the duke energy registrants cash flows  financial position or results of operations 
the duke energy registrants are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations that require significant capital expenditures that can increase the duke energy registrants cost of operations  and which may impact or limit the duke energy registrants business plans  or expose the duke energy registrants to environmental liabilities 
the duke energy registrants are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of the duke energy registrants present and future operations  including air emissions such as reducing nox  nox mercury and greenhouse gas emissions in the us  water quality  wastewater discharges  solid waste and hazardous waste 
these laws and regulations can result in increased capital  operating  and other costs 
these laws and regulations generally require the duke energy registrants to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses  permits  inspections and other approvals 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations can require significant expenditures  including expenditures for cleanup costs and damages arising from contaminated properties  and failure to comply with environmental regulations may result in the imposition of fines  penalties and injunctive measures affecting operating assets 
the steps the duke energy registrants could be required to take to ensure that its facilities are in compliance could be prohibitively expensive 
as a result  the duke energy registrants may be required to shut down or alter the operation of their facilities  which may cause the duke energy registrants to incur losses 
further  the duke energy registrants regulatory rate structure and the duke energy registrants contracts with customers may not necessarily allow the duke energy registrants to recover capital costs the duke energy registrants incur to comply with new environmental regulations 
also  the duke energy registrants may not be able to obtain or maintain from time to time all required environmental regulatory approvals for the duke energy registrants operating assets or development projects 
if there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals  if the duke energy registrants fail to obtain and comply with them or if environmental laws or regulations change and become more stringent  then the operation of the duke energy registrants facilities or the development of new facilities could be prevented  delayed or become subject to additional costs 
although it is not expected that the costs of complying with current environmental regulations will have a material adverse effect on the duke energy registrants financial position  results of operations or cash flows  no assurance can be made that the costs of complying with environmental regulations in the future will not have such an effect 
the epa has proposed new federal regulations governing the management of coal combustion by products  including fly ash 
these regulations may require the duke energy registrants to make additional capital expenditures and increase the duke energy registrants operating and maintenance costs 
additionally  other potential new environmental regulations  limiting the use of coal acquired from mountaintop removal and imposing additional requirements on water discharges associated with mountaintop removal  could require the duke energy registrants to increase costs of fuel and make additional related capital expenditures 
in addition  the duke energy registrants are generally responsible for on site liabilities  and in some cases off site liabilities  associated with the environmental condition of the duke energy registrants power generation facilities and natural gas assets which the duke energy registrants have acquired or developed  regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown 
in connection with some acquisitions and sales of assets  the duke energy registrants may obtain  or be required to provide  indemnification against some environmental liabilities 
if the duke energy registrants incur a material liability  or the other party to a transaction fails to meet its indemnification obligations to the duke energy registrants  the duke energy registrants could suffer material losses 
the duke energy registrants are involved in numerous legal proceedings  the outcome of which are uncertain  and resolution adverse to the duke energy registrants could negatively affect the duke energy registrants financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the duke energy registrants are subject to numerous legal proceedings  including claims for damages for bodily injuries alleged to have arisen prior to from the exposure to or use of asbestos at electric generation plants of duke energy carolinas 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties and the duke energy registrants cannot predict the outcome of individual matters with assurance 
it is reasonably possible that the final resolution of some of the matters in which the duke energy registrants are involved could require the duke energy registrants to make additional expenditures  in excess of established reserves  over an extended period of time and in a range of amounts that could have a material effect on the duke energy registrants cash flows and results of operations 
similarly  it is reasonably possible that the terms of resolution could require the duke energy registrants to change the duke energy registrants business practices and procedures  which could also have a material effect on the duke energy registrants financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the duke energy registrants results of operations may be negatively affected by overall market  economic and other conditions that are beyond the duke energy registrants control 
sustained downturns or sluggishness in the economy generally affect the markets in which the duke energy registrants operate and negatively influence the duke energy registrants energy operations 
declines in demand for energy as a result of economic downturns in the duke energy registrants franchised electric service territories will reduce overall sales and lessen the duke energy registrants cash flows  especially as the duke energy registrants industrial customers reduce production and  therefore  consumption of electricity and gas 
although the duke energy registrants franchised electric and gas business is subject to regulated allowable rates of return and recovery of 
table of contents part i certain costs  such as fuel under periodic adjustment clauses  overall declines in electricity sold as a result of economic downturn or recession could reduce revenues and cash flows  thus diminishing results of operations 
additionally  prolonged economic downturns that negatively impact the duke energy registrants results of operations and cash flows could result in future material impairment charges being recorded to write down the carrying value of certain assets  including goodwill  to their respective fair values 
the duke energy registrants also sell electricity into the spot market or other competitive power markets on a contractual basis 
with respect to such transactions  the duke energy registrants are not guaranteed any rate of return on the duke energy registrants capital investments through mandated rates  and the duke energy registrants revenues and results of operations are likely to depend  in large part  upon prevailing market prices in the duke energy registrants regional markets and other competitive markets 
these market prices may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time and could reduce the duke energy registrants revenues and margins and thereby diminish the duke energy registrants results of operations 
factors that could impact sales volumes  generation of electricity and market prices at which duke energy is able to sell electricity are as follows weather conditions  including abnormally mild winter or summer weather that cause lower energy usage for heating or cooling purposes  respectively  and periods of low rainfall that decrease the duke energy registrants ability to operate its facilities in an economical manner  supply of and demand for energy commodities  transmission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies which impact the duke energy registrants non regulated energy operations  availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources  which are preferred by some customers over electricity produced from coal  nuclear or gas plants  and of energy efficient equipment which reduces energy demand  natural gas  crude oil and refined products production levels and prices  ability to procure satisfactory levels of inventory  such as coal and uranium  electric generation capacity surpluses which cause the duke energy registrants non regulated energy plants to generate and sell less electricity at lower prices and may cause some plants to become non economical to operate  and capacity and transmission service into  or out of  the duke energy registrants markets 
coal inventory levels have increased due to mild weather  low natural gas and power prices resulting in higher combined cycle gas fired generation  and the economy s overall effect on load 
continuation of these factors for an extended period of time  could result in additional costs of managing the coal inventory such as purchased power or other costs 
if these costs are not recoverable the duke energy registrants results of operations could be negatively impacted 
energy conservation could negatively impact the duke energy registrants financial results 
certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and or incentives to reduce energy consumption by certain dates 
additionally  technological advances driven by federal laws mandating new levels of energy efficiency in end use electric devices or other improvements in or applications of technology could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption 
to the extent conservation results in reduced energy demand or significantly slows the growth in demand  the duke energy registrants unregulated business activities could be adversely impacted 
in the duke energy registrants regulated operations  conservation could have a negative impact depending on the regulatory treatment of the associated impacts 
the duke energy registrants currently have energy efficiency riders in place to recover the cost of energy efficiency programs in north carolina  south carolina  ohio and kentucky 
should the duke energy registrants be required to invest in conservation measures that result in reduced sales from effective conservation  regulatory lag in adjusting rates for the impact of these measures could have a negative financial impact 
the duke energy registrants operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis 
electric power generation is generally a seasonal business 
in most parts of the us  and other markets in which the duke energy registrants operate  demand for power peaks during the warmer summer months  with market prices typically peaking at that time 
in other areas  demand for power peaks during the winter 
further  extreme weather conditions such as heat waves or winter storms could cause these seasonal fluctuations to be more pronounced 
as a result  in the future  the overall operating results of the duke energy registrants businesses may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal and quarterly basis and thus make period comparison less relevant 
potential terrorist activities or military or other actions  including cyber system attacks  could adversely affect the duke energy registrants businesses 
the continued threat of terrorism and the impact of retaliatory military and other action by the us and its allies may lead to increased political  economic and financial market instability and volatility in prices for natural gas and oil which may materially adversely affect the duke energy registrants in ways the duke energy registrants cannot predict at this time 
in addition  future acts of terrorism and any possible reprisals as a consequence of action by the us and its allies could be directed against companies operating in the us or their international affiliates 
cyber systems  infrastructure and generation facilities such as the duke energy registrants nuclear plants could be potential targets of terrorist activities or harmful activities by individuals or groups 
the potential for terrorism has subjected the duke energy registrants operations to increased risks and could have a material adverse effect on the duke energy registrants businesses 
in particular  the duke energy registrants may experience increased capital and operating costs to implement increased security for its cyber systems and plants  including its nuclear power plants under the nrc s design basis threat requirements  such as additional physical plant security  additional security personnel or additional capability following a terrorist incident 
the insurance industry has also been disrupted by these potential events 
as a result  the availability of insurance covering risks the duke energy registrants and the duke energy registrants competitors typically insure against may decrease 
in addition  the insurance the duke energy registrants are able to obtain may have higher deductibles  higher premiums  lower coverage limits and more restrictive policy terms 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the duke energy registrants or that the duke energy registrants currently deems to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect the duke energy registrants financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
duke energy carolinas may incur substantial costs and liabilities due to duke energy carolinas ownership and operation of nuclear generating facilities 
duke energy carolinas ownership interest in and operation of three nuclear stations subject duke energy carolinas to various risks including  among other things the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage  handling and disposal of radioactive materials  limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with nuclear operations  and uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives 
duke energy carolinas ownership and operation of nuclear generation facilities requires duke energy carolinas to meet licensing and safety related requirements imposed by the nrc 
in the event of non compliance  the nrc may increase regulatory oversight  impose fines  and or shut down a unit  depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation 
revised security and safety requirements promulgated by the nrc  which could be prompted by  among other things  events within or outside of duke energy carolinas control  such 
table of contents part i as a serious nuclear incident at a facility owned by a third party  could necessitate substantial capital and other expenditures at duke energy carolinas nuclear plants  as well as assessments against duke energy carolinas to cover third party losses 
in addition  if a serious nuclear incident were to occur  it could have a material adverse effect on duke energy carolinas results of operations and financial condition 
duke energy carolinas ownership and operation of nuclear generation facilities also requires duke energy carolinas to maintain funded trusts that are intended to pay for the decommissioning costs of duke energy carolinas nuclear power plants 
poor investment performance of these decommissioning trusts holdings and other factors impacting decommissioning costs could unfavorably impact duke energy carolinas liquidity and results of operations as duke energy carolinas could be required to significantly increase its cash contributions to the decommissioning trusts 
the duke energy registrants operating results depend on the successful operation of electric generating facilities and the duke energy registrants ability to deliver electricity to customers 
operating the duke energy registrants generating facilities and delivery systems involves many risks  such as operator error and breakdown or failure of equipment or processes  including repair and replacement power costs  the inability to adequately manage generation in times of extreme weather ie  storms  peak use periods  droughts  etc  failure of information technology systems and network infrastructure  operational limitations imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements  inadequate or unreliable access to transmission and distribution assets  inability to successfully and timely execute repair  maintenance and or refueling outages  interruptions to the supply of fuel and other commodities used in generation  and failure to adequately forecast system requirement and commodity requirements 
occurrences of these events could adversely affect the duke energy registrants financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the duke energy registrants plans for future expansion and modernization of the duke energy registrants generation fleet subject the duke energy registrants to risk of failure to adequately execute and manage its significant construction plans  as well as the risk of not recovering all costs or of recovering costs in an untimely manner  which could materially impact the duke energy registrants results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
the completion of the duke energy registrants anticipated capital investment projects in existing and new generation facilities is subject to many construction and development risks  including  but not limited to  risks related to financing  obtaining and complying with terms of permits  meeting construction budgets and schedules  and satisfying operating and environmental performance standards 
moreover  the duke energy registrants ability to recover all these costs and recovering costs in a timely manner could materially impact the duke energy registrants consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the duke energy registrants sales may decrease if the duke energy registrants are unable to gain adequate  reliable and affordable access to transmission assets 
the duke energy registrants depend on transmission and distribution facilities owned and operated by utilities and other energy companies to deliver the electricity the duke energy registrants sell to the wholesale market 
ferc s power transmission regulations  as well as those of duke energy s international markets  require wholesale electric transmission services to be offered on an open access  non discriminatory basis 
if transmission is disrupted  or if transmission capacity is inadequate  the duke energy registrants ability to sell and deliver products may be hindered 
the different regional power markets have changing regulatory structures  which could affect the duke energy registrants growth and performance in these regions 
in addition  the independent system operators who oversee the transmission systems in regional power markets have imposed in the past  and may impose in the future  price limitations and other mechanisms to address volatility in the power markets 
these types of price limitations and other mechanisms may adversely impact the profitability of the duke energy registrants wholesale power marketing business 
duke energy ohio s membership in a rto presents risks that could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
the price at which duke energy ohio can sell its generation capacity and energy is dependent on a number of factors  which include the overall supply and demand of generation and load  other state legislation or regulation  transmission congestion  and its business rules 
as a result  the prices in day ahead and real time energy markets and rto capacity markets are subject to price volatility 
administrative costs imposed by rtos  including the cost of administering energy markets  are also subject to volatility 
pjm interconnection  llc pjm conducts reliability pricing model rpm base residual auctions for capacity on an annual planning year basis 
the results of the pjm rpm base residual auction are impacted by the supply and demand of generation and load and also may be impacted by congestion and pjm rules relating to bidding for demand response and energy efficiency resources 
auction prices could fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time 
duke energy ohio cannot predict the outcome of future auctions  but if the auction prices are sustained at low levels  duke energy ohio s results of operations  financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted 
the rules governing the various regional power markets may also change  which could affect duke energy ohio s costs and or revenues 
to the degree duke energy ohio incurs significant additional fees and increased costs to participate in an rto  duke energy ohio s results of operations may be impacted 
duke energy ohio may be allocated a portion of the cost of transmission facilities built by others due to changes in rto transmission rate design 
duke energy ohio may be required to expand its transmission system according to decisions made by an rto rather than duke energy ohio s internal planning process 
while pjm transmission rates were initially designed to be revenue neutral  various proposals and proceedings currently taking place by the ferc may cause transmission rates to change from time to time 
in addition  pjm has been developing rules associated with the allocation and methodology of assigning costs associated with improved transmission reliability  reduced transmission congestion and firm transmission rights that may have a financial impact on duke energy ohio 
duke energy ohio may also incur fees and costs to participate in pjm 
as a member of an rto  duke energy ohio is subject to certain additional risks  including those associated with the allocation among pjm members  of losses caused by unreimbursed defaults of other participants in the pjm market and those associated with complaint cases filed against pjm that may seek refunds of revenues previously earned by pjm members  including duke energy ohio 
deregulation or restructuring in the electric industry may result in increased competition and unrecovered costs that could adversely affect duke energy carolinas and duke energy indiana s financial position  results of operations or cash flows and duke energy carolinas and duke energy indiana s utility businesses 
increased competition resulting from deregulation or restructuring efforts  including from the energy policy act of  could have a significant adverse financial impact on duke energy carolinas and duke energy indiana and their utility subsidiaries and consequently on duke energy carolinas and duke energy indiana s results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
increased competition could also result in increased pressure to lower costs  including the cost of electricity 
retail competition and the unbundling of regulated energy and gas service could have a significant adverse financial impact on duke energy carolinas and duke energy indiana and their subsidiaries due to an impairment of assets  a loss of retail customers  lower profit margins or increased costs of capital 
duke energy carolinas and duke energy indiana cannot predict the extent and timing of entry by additional competitors into the electric markets 
duke energy carolinas and duke energy indiana cannot predict when they will be subject to changes in legislation or regulation  nor can duke energy carolinas and duke energy indiana predict the impact of these changes on their financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents part i duke energy s investments and projects located outside of the united states expose duke energy to risks related to laws of other countries  taxes  economic conditions  political conditions and policies of foreign governments 
these risks may delay or reduce duke energy s realization of value from duke energy s international projects 
duke energy currently owns and may acquire and or dispose of material energy related investments and projects outside the us the economic  regulatory  market and political conditions in some of the countries where duke energy has interests or in which duke energy may explore development  acquisition or investment opportunities could present risks related to  among others  duke energy s ability to obtain financing on suitable terms  duke energy s customers ability to honor their obligations with respect to projects and investments  delays in construction  limitations on duke energy s ability to enforce legal rights  and interruption of business  as well as risks of war  expropriation  nationalization  renegotiation  trade sanctions or nullification of existing contracts and changes in law  regulations  market rules or tax policy 
duke energy s investments and projects located outside of the united states expose duke energy to risks related to fluctuations in currency rates 
these risks  and duke energy s activities to mitigate such risks  may adversely affect duke energy s cash flows and results of operations 
duke energy s operations and investments outside the us expose duke energy to risks related to fluctuations in currency rates 
as each local currency s value changes relative to the us dollar duke energy s principal reporting currency the value in us dollars of duke energy s assets and liabilities in such locality and the cash flows generated in such locality  expressed in us dollars  also change 
duke energy s primary foreign currency rate exposure is to the brazilian real 
duke energy selectively mitigates some risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations by  among other things  indexing contracts to the us dollar and or local inflation rates  hedging through debt denominated or issued in the foreign currency and hedging through foreign currency derivatives 
these efforts  however  may not be effective and  in some cases  may expose duke energy to other risks that could negatively affect duke energy s cash flows and results of operations 
poor investment performance of the duke energy pension plan holdings and other factors impacting pension plan costs could unfavorably impact the duke energy registrants liquidity and results of operations 
duke energy s costs of providing non contributory defined benefit pension plans are dependent upon a number of factors  such as the rates of return on plan assets  discount rates  the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans  future government regulation and duke energy s required or voluntary contributions made to the plans 
the subsidiary registrants participate in employee benefit plans sponsored by their parent  duke energy 
the subsidiary registrants are allocated their proportionate share of the cost and obligations related to these plans 
without sustained growth in the pension investments over time to increase the value of duke energy s plan assets and depending upon the other factors impacting duke energy s costs as listed above  duke energy could be required to fund its plans with significant amounts of cash 
such cash funding obligations  and the subsidiary registrants proportionate share of such cash funding obligations  could have a material impact on the duke energy registrants financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could unfavorably impact the duke energy registrants results of operations 
certain events  such as an aging workforce  mismatch of skill set or complement to future needs  or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs 
the challenges include lack of resources  loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development 
in this case  costs  including costs for contractors to replace employees  productivity costs and safety costs  may rise 
failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees  including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees  or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the business 
if the duke energy registrants are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce  the duke energy registrants financial position or results of operations could be negatively affected 
duke energy may be unable to obtain the approvals required to complete its merger with progress energy or  in order to do so  the combined company may be required to comply with material restrictions or conditions 
on january   duke energy announced the execution of a merger agreement with progress energy 
before the merger may be completed  approval must be received from the ferc and various state utility  regulatory  antitrust and other authorities in the us  and there is no assurance that duke energy will obtain all required approvals 
moreover  these governmental authorities may impose conditions on the completion  or require changes to the terms  of the merger  including restrictions or conditions on the business  operations  or financial performance of the combined company following completion of the merger 
these conditions or changes could have the effect of delaying completion of the merger or imposing additional costs on or limiting the revenues of the combined company following the merger  which could have a material adverse effect on the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the combined company and or cause either duke energy or progress energy to abandon the merger 
conditions imposed by governmental authorities  including restrictions or conditions on the business  operations  or financial performance of duke energy carolinas following the merger could have a material adverse effect on the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of duke energy carolinas or could have a material reduction in the expected benefits of the transaction to duke energy shareholders 
if completed  duke energy s merger with progress energy may not achieve its intended results 
duke energy and progress energy entered into the merger agreement with the expectation that the merger would result in various benefits  including  among other things  cost savings and operating efficiencies relating to the joint dispatch of generation and combining of fuel purchasing power 
achieving the anticipated benefits of the merger is subject to a number of uncertainties  including market conditions  risks related to progress energy s and duke energy s respective businesses  and whether the business of progress energy is integrated in an efficient and effective manner 
failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs  decreases in the amount of expected revenues generated by the combined company and diversion of management s time and energy and could have an adverse effect on the combined company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
if completed  duke energy will record goodwill related to the merger with progress energy 
impairment of goodwill could have a significant negative impact on duke energy s financial condition and results of operations 
generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the us require that one party to the merger be identified as the acquirer 
in accordance with these standards  the merger will be accounted for as an acquisition of progress energy common stock by duke energy and will follow the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations 
the assets and liabilities of progress energy will be consolidated with those of duke energy 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of progress energy s assets and liabilities will be recorded as goodwill 
the amount of goodwill  which is expected to be material  will be allocated to the appropriate reporting units of the combined company 
duke energy is required to assess goodwill for impairment at least annually and more frequently if events or circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
under current accounting guidance  an entity may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a two step goodwill impairment test 
duke energy s annual qualitative assessments of goodwill include reviews of current forecasts compared to prior forecasts  consideration of recent fair value 
table of contents part i calculations  if any  review of duke energy s  as well as its peers  stock price performance  credit ratings of duke energy s significant subsidiaries  updates to weighted average cost of capital wacc calculations or review of the key inputs to the wacc and consideration of overall economic factors  recent regulatory commission actions and related regulatory climates  and recent financial performance 
if the results of qualitative assessments indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying value of the reporting unit  the two step impairment test is required 
step one of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of reporting units with their carrying values  including goodwill 
to the extent the carrying value of any of those reporting units is greater than the fair value of the related reporting units  a second step comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying amount would be required to determine if the goodwill is impaired 
such a potential impairment could result in a charge that would have a material impact on duke energy s future financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
duke energy is subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the merger with progress energy is pending that could adversely affect duke energy s financial results 
uncertainty about the effect of the merger with progress energy on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on duke energy 
although duke energy has taken and intends to continue to take steps designed to reduce any adverse effects  these uncertainties may impair duke energy s ability to attract  retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is completed and for a period of time thereafter  and could cause customers  suppliers and others that deal with duke energy to seek to change existing business relationships 
employee retention and recruitment may be particularly challenging prior to the completion of the merger  as employees and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company 
if  despite duke energy s retention and recruiting efforts  key employees depart or fail to accept employment with duke energy because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the combined company  duke energy s financial results could be affected 
the pursuit of the merger and the preparation for the integration of progress energy into duke energy may place a significant burden on management and internal resources 
the diversion of management attention away from day to day business concerns and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could affect duke energy s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in addition  the merger agreement restricts duke energy  without progress energy s consent  from making certain acquisitions and taking other specified actions until the merger occurs or the merger agreement terminates 
these restrictions may prevent duke energy from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities and making other changes to duke energy s business prior to completion of the merger or termination of the merger agreement 
failure to complete the merger with progress energy could negatively impact duke energy s stock price and duke energy s future business and financial results 
if duke energy s merger with progress energy is not completed  duke energy s ongoing business and financial results may be adversely affected and duke energy will be subject to a number of risks  including the following duke energy may be required  under specified circumstances set forth in the merger agreement  to pay progress energy a termination fee of million  duke energy will be required to pay costs relating to the merger  including legal  accounting  financial advisory  filing and printing costs  whether or not the merger is completed  and matters relating to duke energy s merger with progress energy including integration planning may require substantial commitments of time and resources by duke energy s management  which could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to duke energy 
duke energy could also be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete its merger with progress energy 
if the merger is not completed  these risks may materialize and may adversely affect duke energy s financial position  results of operations or cash flows

duke energy ohio completed its regional transmission organization rto realignment from the midwest independent transmission system operator  inc midwest iso to pjm interconnection  llc pjm  on december  benefits of the realignment from midwest iso to pjm include greater electrical interconnectivity  reduced congestion and production costs  a capacity market structure that promotes long term contracting  consolidation of duke energy ohio s coal fired and gas fired generation into a single market area and alignment of duke energy ohio s jointly owned generation units into a single market area that provides for a consistent dispatch signal 
in conjunction with the realignment  duke energy ohio recorded a liability related to its midwest iso exit obligation and share of mtep costs  excluding multi value projects mvp of approximately million 
approximately million of this amount was recorded as a regulatory asset while the remainder was recorded as an expense 
in addition to the above amounts  duke energy ohio may also be responsible for costs associated with the midwest iso mvp projects 
duke energy ohio is contesting its obligation to pay for such costs 
however  depending on the final outcome of this matter  duke energy ohio could incur material costs associated with mvp 
objectives 
duke energy will focus on managing regulatory approvals related to the proposed merger with progress energy  completing its remaining major capital projects  obtaining constructive regulatory outcomes and achieving its adjusted diluted earnings target and continuing to grow annual dividends 

table of contents part ii managing regulatory approvals related to the proposed merger with progress energy 
in december  the ferc rejected duke energy and progress energy s proposed mitigation plan related to market power concerns 
duke energy and progress energy continue to evaluate the ferc s december order in an attempt to develop an alternative proposal 
in addition to addressing ferc s market power concerns  any subsequent filing needs to be structured to balance retaining benefits of the transaction for duke energy and progress energy s customers and shareholders 
prior to submitting an alternative proposal to ferc  duke energy and progress energy are required to make a day notification filing with the ncuc 
accordingly  duke energy filed advance notice of the revised ferc mitigation plan on february  completing remaining major capital projects 
duke energy anticipates total capital expenditures of billion to billion in approximately billion of these expenditures are related to expansion and growth projects  including but not limited to  the edwardsport igcc plant  cliffside unit and dan river combined cycle facility 
duke energy also plans to complete mw of wind projects in its non regulated businesses during before the expiration of federal tax incentives 
obtaining constructive regulatory outcomes 
the majority of future earnings are anticipated to be contributed from us franchised electric and gas usfe g  which consists of duke energy s regulated businesses 
duke energy carolinas plans to file rate cases in north carolina and south carolina during duke energy ohio plans to file for electric distribution and gas rate cases in these planned rates cases are needed to recover investments in duke energy s ongoing infrastructure modernization projects and operating costs 
planning for and obtaining favorable outcomes from these regulatory proceedings as well as recovery of the edwardsport igcc plant are a key factor in achieving duke energy s long term growth assumptions 
achieving adjusted diluted earnings target and growing annual dividends 
duke energy s adjusted diluted earnings per share outlook range for is to 
attainment of this range will be a key factor in achieving duke energy s targeted long term adjusted earnings growth plan from a base of refer to the section results of operations for the definition of adjusted earnings  a non gaap financial measure 
duke energy expects its financial results as compared to to be impacted by the items discussed below 
positive earnings drivers for are expected to include increased earnings from ongoing modernization program and rate cases  and increased weather normalized retail load growth 
negative earnings drivers for are expected to include an assumed return to normal weather in compared to favorable weather experienced in  the impact of the new esp on ohio coal fired generation operations  lower results from midwest gas assets as a result of lower pjm capacity prices  and the impact of potentially unfavorable exchange rates for foreign operations 
economic factors for duke energy s business 
the historical and future trends of duke energy s operating results have been and will be affected in varying degrees by a number of factors  including those discussed below 
duke energy s revenues depend on customer usage  which varies with weather conditions and behavior patterns  general business conditions and the cost of energy services 
various regulatory agencies approve the prices for electric service within their respective jurisdictions and affect duke energy s ability to recover its costs from customers 
declines in demand for electricity as a result of economic downturns reduce overall electricity sales and have the potential to lessen duke energy s cash flows  especially if retail customers reduce consumption of electricity 
a weakening economy could also impact duke energy s customers ability to pay  causing increased delinquencies  slowing collections and leading to higher than normal levels of accounts receivables  bad debts and financing requirements 
a portion of usfe g s business risk is mitigated by its regulated allowable rates of return and recovery of fuel costs under fuel adjustment clauses 
duke energy s business model provides diversification between relatively stable regulated businesses like those in usfe g  and the commodity cyclical and contracted businesses like commercial power and international energy 
duke energy s businesses can be negatively affected by sustained downturns or sluggishness in the economy 
market prices of commodities  which are beyond duke energy s control  could have a significant positive or negative impact on the achievement of duke energy s goals for and beyond 
if negative market conditions should persist over time and estimated cash flows over the lives of duke energy s individual assets  including goodwill  do not exceed the carrying value of those individual assets  asset impairments may occur in the future under existing accounting rules and diminish results of operations 
a change in management s intent about the use of individual assets held for use versus held for sale could also result in impairments or losses 
duke energy evaluates the carrying amount of its recorded goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of august and performs interim impairment tests if a triggering event occurs that indicates it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
for further information on key assumptions that impact duke energy s goodwill impairment assessments  see critical accounting policy for goodwill impairment assessments and note to the consolidated financial statements  goodwill  intangible assets and impairments 
duke energy s goals for and beyond could also be substantially at risk due to the regulation of its businesses 
duke energy s businesses in the us are subject to regulation on the federal and state level 
regulations  applicable to the electric power industry  have a significant impact on the nature of the businesses and the manner in which they operate 
duke energy plans to file various rate cases with several state regulatory agencies during new legislation and changes to regulations are ongoing  including anticipated carbon legislation  and duke energy cannot predict the future course of changes in the regulatory or political environment or the ultimate effect that any such future changes will have on its business 
results of usfe g are also impacted by the completion of its major generation fleet modernization projects 
duke energy makes substantial investments in power plant upgrades and to maintain the reliability of the energy transmission and distribution system 
regulatory approval is needed to recover the costs of these investments  which are expected to provide a significant cash flow to enable recovery of costs incurred on a timely basis 
duke energy indiana is complete with the edwardsport igcc power plant  which is expected to be in service in updates to the cost estimate have led duke energy indiana to filing a proposed cap on the projects construction costs excluding financing costs which can be recovered through rates at billion 
as a result  duke energy indiana has recorded pre tax charges to earnings of million in the third quarter of and million in the third quarter of to reflect the impact of cost over runs 
updates to the cost estimate could occur through the completion of the plant 
duke energy indiana is awaiting an order from the indiana utility regulatory commission iurc regarding the cost estimate increase and the allegations of fraud  concealment and gross mismanagement related to the igcc project 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  regulatory matters  for further discussion of the significant increase in the estimated cost of the mw edwardsport igcc plant 

table of contents part ii duke energy s earnings are impacted by fluctuations in commodity prices 
exposure to commodity prices generates higher earnings volatility in the unregulated businesses 
to mitigate these risks  duke energy enters into derivative instruments to effectively hedge some  but not all  known exposures 
additionally  duke energy s investments and projects located outside of the us expose duke energy to risks related to laws of other countries  taxes  economic conditions  fluctuations in currency rates  political conditions and policies of foreign governments 
changes in these factors are difficult to predict and may impact duke energy s future results 
duke energy also relies on access to both short term money markets and longer term capital markets as a source of liquidity for capital requirements not met by cash flow from operations 
an inability to access capital at competitive rates or at all could adversely affect duke energy s ability to implement its strategy 
market disruptions or a downgrade of duke energy s credit rating may increase its cost of borrowing or adversely affect its ability to access one or more sources of liquidity 
for further information related to management s assessment of duke energy s risk factors  see item a 
risk factors 
results of operations duke energy in this section  duke energy provides analysis and discussion of earnings and factors affecting earnings on both a gaap and non gaap basis 
management evaluates financial performance in part based on the non gaap financial measure  adjusted earnings  which is measured as income from continuing operations after deducting income attributable to noncontrolling interests  adjusted for the impact of special items and the mark to market impacts of economic hedges in the commercial power segment 
special items represent certain charges and credits  which management believes will not be recurring on a regular basis  although it is reasonably possible such charges and credits could recur 
mark to market adjustments reflect the mark to market impact of derivative contracts  which is recognized in gaap earnings immediately as such derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting or regulatory accounting treatment  used in duke energy s hedging of a portion of economic value of its generation assets in the commercial power segment 
the economic value of the generation assets is subject to fluctuations in fair value due to market price volatility of the input and output commodities eg  coal  power and  as such  the economic hedging involves both purchases and sales of those input and output commodities related to the generation assets 
because the operations of the generation assets are accounted for under the accrual method  management believes that excluding the impact of mark to market changes of the economic hedge contracts from operating earnings until settlement better matches the financial impacts of the hedge contract with the portion of economic value of the underlying hedged asset 
management believes that the presentation of adjusted earnings provides useful information to investors  as it provides them an additional relevant comparison of duke energy s performance across periods 
management uses this non gaap financial measure for planning and forecasting and for reporting results to the board of directors  employees  shareholders  analysts and investors concerning duke energy s financial performance 
the most directly comparable gaap measure for adjusted earnings is net income attributable to duke energy common shareholders  which includes the impact of special items  the mark to market impacts of economic hedges in the commercial power segment and discontinued operations

table of contents part ii critical accounting policies and estimates the application of accounting policies and estimates is an important process that continues to develop as duke energy s operations change and accounting guidance evolves 
duke energy has identified a number of critical accounting policies and estimates that require the use of significant estimates and judgments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on other various assumptions that it believes are reasonable at the time of application 
the estimates and judgments may change as time passes and more information about duke energy s environment becomes available 
if estimates and judgments are different than the actual amounts recorded  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to take into consideration the new information 
duke energy discusses its critical accounting policies and estimates and other significant accounting policies with senior members of management and the audit committee  as appropriate 
duke energy s critical accounting policies and estimates are discussed below 
regulatory accounting duke energy s regulated operations the substantial majority of us franchised electric and gas s operations meet the criteria for application of regulatory accounting treatment 
as a result  duke energy records assets and liabilities that result from the regulated ratemaking process that would not be recorded under gaap in the us for non regulated entities 
regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in customer rates 
regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to make refunds to customers for previous collections for costs that either are not likely to or have yet to be incurred 
management continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory environment changes  historical regulatory treatment for similar costs in duke energy s jurisdictions  recent rate orders to other regulated entities  and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation 
based on this continual assessment  management believes the existing regulatory assets are probable of recovery 
this assessment reflects the current political and regulatory climate at the state and federal levels  and is subject to change in the future 
if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable  the asset write offs would be required to be recognized in operating income 
additionally  the regulatory agencies can provide flexibility in the manner and timing of the depreciation of property  plant and equipment  recognition of nuclear decommissioning costs and amortization of regulatory assets or may disallow recovery of all or a portion of certain assets 
total regulatory assets were  million as of december   and  million as of december  total regulatory liabilities were  million as of december  and  million as of december  for further information  see note to the consolidated financial statements  regulatory matters 
in order to apply regulatory accounting treatment and record regulatory assets and liabilities  certain criteria must be met 
in determining whether the criteria are met for its operations  management makes significant judgments  including determining whether revenue rates for services provided to customers are subject to approval by an independent  third party regulator  whether the regulated rates are designed to recover specific costs of providing the regulated service  and a determination of whether  in view of the demand for the regulated services and the level of competition  it is reasonable to assume that rates set at levels that will recover the operations costs can be charged to and collected from customers 
this final criterion requires consideration of anticipated changes in levels of demand or competition  direct and indirect  during the recovery period for any capitalized costs 
the regulatory accounting rules require recognition of a loss if it becomes probable that part of the cost of a plant under construction or a recently completed plant will be disallowed for ratemaking purposes and a reasonable estimate of the amount of the disallowance can be made 
such assessments can require significant judgment by management regarding matters such as the ultimate cost of a plant under construction  regulatory recovery implications  etc 
as discussed in note  regulatory matters  during and duke energy indiana recorded disallowance charges of million and million  respectively  related to the igcc plant currently under construction in edwardsport  indiana 
management will continue to assess matters as the construction of the plant and the related regulatory proceedings continue  and further charges could be required in or beyond 
as discussed further in note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  regulatory matters  duke energy ohio discontinued the application of regulatory accounting treatment to portions of its generation operations in november in conjunction with the approval of its new electric security plan by the public utilities commission of ohio 
the effect of this change was immaterial to the financial statements 
goodwill impairment assessments duke energy s goodwill balances are included in the following table 
december  in millions us franchised electric and gas commercial power international energy total duke energy goodwill the majority of duke energy s goodwill relates to the acquisition of cinergy in april  whose assets are primarily included in the us franchised electric and gas and commercial power segments 
commercial power also has million of goodwill that resulted from the september acquisition of catamount energy corporation  a leading wind power company located in rutland  vermont 
as of the acquisition date  duke energy allocates goodwill to a reporting unit  which duke energy defines as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
duke energy recorded impairments of million and million related to commercial power s non regulated midwest generation reporting unit in and subsequent to the impairment charges  there is no recorded amount of goodwill at commercial power s non regulated midwest generation reporting unit 
these impairment charges are recorded in goodwill and other impairment charges on duke energy s consolidated statement of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  goodwill  intangible assets and impairments for further information regarding the factors impacting the valuation of commercial power s non regulated generation reporting unit 
duke energy determined that no other goodwill impairments existed in  and as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  goodwill  intangible assets and impairments  duke energy is required to test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually and more frequently if events or circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
duke energy evaluates the carrying amount of its recorded goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of august and performs interim impairment tests if a triggering event occurs that indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
the analysis of the potential impairment of goodwill has historically required a two step process 
however  effective with the fasb s september issuance of new goodwill 
table of contents part ii accounting guidance  an entity may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
duke energy s annual qualitative assessments under the new accounting guidance include reviews of current forecasts compared to prior forecasts  consideration of recent fair value calculations  if any  review of duke energy s  as well as its peers  stock price performance  credit ratings of duke energy s significant subsidiaries  updates to weighted average cost of capital wacc calculations or review of the key inputs to the wacc and consideration of overall economic factors  recent regulatory commission actions and related regulatory climates  and recent financial performance 
if the results of qualitative assessments indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying value of the reporting unit  the two step impairment test is required 
in  duke energy  after completion of its qualitative assessments of the factors noted above  concluded that it was more likely than not the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 
thus  the two step goodwill impairment test was not necessary in for years in which the two step impairment test is necessary  such as was the case in and  step one of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of reporting units with their carrying values  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  step two must be performed to determine the amount  if any  of the goodwill impairment loss 
if the carrying amount is less than fair value  further testing of goodwill is not performed 
step two of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill against the carrying value of the goodwill 
under step two  determining the implied fair value of goodwill requires the valuation of a reporting unit s identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination on the testing date 
the difference between the fair value of the entire reporting unit as determined in step one and the net fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill 
the goodwill impairment charge  if any  would be the difference between the carrying amount of goodwill and the implied fair value of goodwill upon the completion of step two 
for purposes of the step one analyses  determination of the reporting units fair values is based on a combination of the income approach  which estimates the fair value of duke energy s reporting units based on discounted future cash flows  and the market approach  which estimates the fair value of duke energy s reporting units based on market comparables within the utility and energy industries 
key assumptions used in the income approach analyses for the us franchised electric and gas reporting units include  but are not limited to  the use of an appropriate discount rate  estimated future cash flows and estimated run rates of operation  maintenance  and general and administrative costs  and expectations of returns on equity in each regulated jurisdiction that will be achieved 
in estimating cash flows  duke energy incorporates expected growth rates  regulatory stability and ability to renew contracts  as well as other factors  into its revenue and expense forecasts 
estimated future cash flows under the income approach are based to a large extent on duke energy s internal business plan  and adjusted as appropriate for duke energy s views of market participant assumptions 
duke energy s internal business plan reflects management s assumptions related to customer usage and attrition based on internal data and economic data obtained from third party sources  projected commodity pricing data and potential changes in environmental regulations 
the business plan assumes the occurrence of certain events in the future  such as the outcome of future rate filings  future approved rates of returns on equity  anticipated earnings returns related to significant future capital investments  continued recovery of cost of service and the renewal of certain contracts 
management also makes assumptions regarding the run rate of operation  maintenance and general and administrative costs based on the expected outcome of the aforementioned events 
should the actual outcome of some or all of these assumptions differ significantly from the current assumptions  revisions to current cash flow assumptions could cause the fair value of duke energy s reporting units to be significantly different in future periods 
one of the most significant assumptions that duke energy utilizes in determining the fair value of its reporting units under the income approach is the discount rate applied to the estimated future cash flows 
management determines the appropriate discount rate for each of its reporting units based on the wacc for each individual reporting unit 
the wacc takes into account both the pre tax cost of debt and cost of equity a major component of the cost of equity is the current risk free rate on twenty year us treasury bonds 
in the and step one impairment tests  duke energy considered implied wacc s for certain peer companies in determining the appropriate wacc rates to use in its analysis 
as each reporting unit has a different risk profile based on the nature of its operations  including factors such as regulation  the wacc for each reporting unit may differ 
accordingly  the waccs were adjusted  as appropriate  to account for company specific risk premiums 
for example  transmission and distribution reporting units generally would have a lower company specific risk premium as they do not have the higher level of risk associated with owning and operating generation assets nor do they have significant construction risk or risk associated with potential future carbon legislation or pending epa regulations 
the discount rates used for calculating the fair values as of august   for each of duke energy s domestic reporting units were commensurate with the risks associated with each reporting unit and ranged from to 
for duke energy s international operations  a base discount rate of was used  with specific adders used for each separate jurisdiction in which international energy operates to reflect the differing risk profiles of the jurisdictions and countries 
this resulted in discount rates for the august  goodwill impairment test for the international operations ranging from to 
as discussed above  in duke energy performed a qualitative assessment of potential goodwill impairment  and thus a step one valuation was not necessary 
management s qualitative assessment took into consideration the decline in of a key input to the wacc calculation  namely  a decline in the current risk free rate on twenty year us treasury bonds 
management concluded that had step one valuations been necessary  the decline in this key wacc input would likely have resulted in lower discount rates and higher income approach valuations 
the underlying assumptions and estimates are made as of a point in time  subsequent changes  particularly changes in the discount rates or growth rates inherent in management s estimates of future cash flows  could result in future impairment charges 
management continues to remain alert for any indicators that the fair value of a reporting unit could be below book value and will assess goodwill for impairment as appropriate 
the majority of duke energy s business is in environments that are either fully or partially rate regulated 
in such environments  revenue requirements are adjusted periodically by regulators based on factors including levels of costs  sales volumes and costs of capital 
accordingly  duke energy s regulated utilities operate to some degree with a buffer from the direct effects  positive or negative  of significant swings in market or economic conditions 
however  management will continue to monitor changes in the business  as well as overall market conditions and economic factors that could require additional impairment tests 
long lived asset impairment assessments property  plant and equipment is stated at the lower of historical cost less accumulated depreciation or fair value  if impaired 
duke energy evaluates property  plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
the determination of whether an impairment has occurred is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets  as compared with the carrying value of the assets 
performing an impairment evaluation involves a significant degree of estimation and judgment in areas such as identifying circumstances that indicate an impairment may exist  identifying and grouping affected assets  and developing the undiscounted and discounted future cash flows used to estimate fair value in the absence of market based value associated with the asset 
additionally  determining fair values requires probability weighting the cash flows to reflect 
table of contents part ii expectations about possible variations in their amounts or timing and the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
although cash flow estimates are based on relevant information available at the time the estimates are made  estimates of future cash flows are  by nature  highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results 
if an impairment has occurred  the amount of the impairment recognized is determined by estimating the fair value of the assets and recording a loss if the carrying value is greater than the fair value 
for assets identified as held for sale  the carrying value is compared to the estimated fair value less the cost to sell in order to determine if an impairment loss is required 
until the assets are disposed of  their estimated fair value is re evaluated when circumstances or events change 
when it becomes probable that regulated generation  transmission or distribution assets have been abandoned  the cost of the asset is removed from plant in service 
the value that may be retained as an asset on the balance sheet for the abandoned property is dependent upon amounts that may recovered through regulated rates  including any return 
as such  an impairment charge could be offset by the establishment of a regulatory asset if rate recovery is probable 
as discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements  goodwill  intangible assets and impairments  in the third quarter of  commercial power recorded million of pre tax impairment charges related to clean air act emission allowances which were no longer expected to be used as a result of the new cross state air pollution rule 
in the second quarter of  commercial power recorded million of pre tax impairment charges related to certain generating assets and emission allowances primarily associated with these generation assets in the midwest to write down the value of these assets to their estimated fair value 
the generation assets that were subject to this impairment charge were those coal fired generating assets that do not have certain environmental emissions control equipment  causing these generation assets to be potentially heavily impacted by the epa s rules on emissions of nox and nox 
additionally  in the third quarter of  commercial power recorded million of pre tax impairment charges related to certain generating assets and emission allowances primarily associated with these generation assets in the midwest to write down the value of these assets to their estimated fair value 
these impairment charges are recorded in goodwill and other impairment charges on duke energy s consolidated statement of operations 
revenue recognition revenues on sales of electricity and gas are recognized when either the service is provided or the product is delivered 
operating revenues include unbilled electric and gas revenues earned when service has been delivered but not billed by the end of the accounting period 
unbilled retail revenues are estimated by applying an average revenue per kilowatt hour kwh or per mcf for all customer classes to the number of estimated kwh or mcf delivered but not billed 
unbilled wholesale energy revenues are calculated by applying the contractual rate per megawatt hour mwh to the number of estimated mwh delivered but not yet billed 
unbilled wholesale demand revenues are calculated by applying the contractual rate per mw to the mw volume delivered but not yet billed 
the amount of unbilled revenues can vary significantly from period to period as a result of numerous factors  including seasonality  weather  customer usage patterns and customer mix 
at december  and  duke energy had million and million  respectively  of unbilled revenues within restricted receivables of variable interest entities and receivables on their respective consolidated balance sheets 
accounting for loss contingencies duke energy is involved in certain legal and environmental matters that arise in the normal course of business 
in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements  management makes judgments regarding the future outcome of contingent events and records a loss contingency when it is determined that it is probable that a loss has occurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
management regularly reviews current information available to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple forecasts and scenarios that often depend on judgments about potential actions by third parties  such as federal  state and local courts and other regulators 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long periods of time 
amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may differ from the actual outcome once the contingency is resolved  which could have a material impact on future results of operations  financial position and cash flows of duke energy 
duke energy has experienced numerous claims for indemnification and medical cost reimbursement relating to damages for bodily injuries alleged to have arisen from the exposure to or use of asbestos in connection with construction and maintenance activities conducted by duke energy carolinas on its electric generation plants prior to amounts recognized as asbestos related reserves in the respective consolidated balance sheets totaled million and million as of december  and december   respectively  and are classified in other within deferred credits and other liabilities and other within current liabilities 
these reserves are based upon the minimum amount in duke energy s best estimate of the range of loss for current and future asbestos claims through management believes that it is possible there will be additional claims filed against duke energy after in light of the uncertainties inherent in a longer term forecast  management does not believe that they can reasonably estimate the indemnity and medical costs that might be incurred after related to such potential claims 
asbestos related loss estimates incorporate anticipated inflation  if applicable  and are recorded on an undiscounted basis 
these reserves are based upon current estimates and are subject to greater uncertainty as the projection period lengthens 
a significant upward or downward trend in the number of claims filed  the nature of the alleged injury  and the average cost of resolving each such claim could change our estimated liability  as could any substantial adverse or favorable verdict at trial 
a federal legislative solution  further state tort reform or structured settlement transactions could also change the estimated liability 
given the uncertainties associated with projecting matters into the future and numerous other factors outside our control  management believes that it is possible duke energy may incur asbestos liabilities in excess of the recorded reserves 
duke energy has a third party insurance policy to cover certain losses related to asbestos related injuries and damages above an aggregate self insured retention of million 
duke energy s cumulative payments began to exceed the self insurance retention on its insurance policy in future payments up to the policy limit will be reimbursed by duke energy s third party insurance carrier 
the insurance policy limit for potential future insurance recoveries for indemnification and medical cost claim payments is million in excess of the self insured retention 
insurance recoveries of million and million related to this policy are classified in the consolidated balance sheets in other within investments and other assets and receivables as of december  and  respectively 
duke energy is not aware of any uncertainties regarding the legal sufficiency of insurance claims 
management believes the insurance recovery asset is probable of recovery as the insurance carrier continues to have a strong financial strength rating

accounting for income taxes significant management judgment is required in determining duke energy s provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against duke energy s net deferred tax assets  if any 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the book basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the probability of realizing deferred tax 
table of contents part ii assets is based on forecasts of future taxable income and the use of tax planning that could impact the ability to realize deferred tax assets 
if future utilization of deferred tax assets is uncertain  a valuation allowance may be recorded against certain deferred tax assets 
in assessing the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets  management considers estimates of the amount and character of future taxable income 
actual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to the impacts of various items  including changes to income tax laws  duke energy s forecasted financial condition and results of operations in future periods  as well as results of audits and examinations of filed tax returns by taxing authorities 
although management believes current estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from these estimates 
significant judgment is also required in computing duke energy s quarterly effective tax rate etr 
etr calculations are revised each quarter based on the best full year tax assumptions available at that time  including  but not limited to  income levels  deductions and credits 
in accordance with interim tax reporting rules  a tax expense or benefit is recorded every quarter to adjust for the difference in tax expense computed based on the actual year to date etr versus the forecasted annual etr 
duke energy recognizes tax benefits for positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns  including the decision to exclude certain income or transactions from a return  when a more likely than not threshold is met for a tax position and management believes that the position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities 
duke energy records the largest amount of the tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon settlement 
management evaluates each position based solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position  assuming the position will be examined by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information 
significant management judgment is required to determine recognition thresholds and the related amount of tax benefits to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
management reevaluates tax positions each period in which new information about recognition or measurement becomes available 
the portion of the tax benefit which is uncertain is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
undistributed foreign earnings associated with international energy s operations are considered indefinitely reinvested  thus no us tax is recorded on such earnings 
this assertion is based on management s determination that the cash held in international energy s foreign jurisdictions is not needed to fund the operations of its us operations and that international energy either has invested or has intentions to reinvest such earnings 
while management currently intends to indefinitely reinvest all of international energy s unremitted earnings  should circumstances change  duke energy may need to record additional income tax expense in the period in which such determination changes 
the cumulative undistributed earnings as of december   on which duke energy has not provided deferred us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes is billion 
the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these undistributed earnings is estimated at between million and million 
for further information  see note to the consolidated financial statements  income taxes 
pension and other post retirement benefits the calculation of pension expense  other post retirement benefit expense and pension and other post retirement liabilities require the use of assumptions 
changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and reported liability amounts  and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions 
duke energy believes that the most critical assumptions for pension and other post retirement benefits are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 
additionally  medical and prescription drug cost trend rate assumptions are critical to duke energy s estimates of other post retirement benefits 
funding requirements for defined benefit plans are determined by government regulations 
duke energy made voluntary contributions to its defined benefit retirement plans of million in  million in and million in in  duke energy anticipates making million of contributions to its defined benefit plans 
duke energy and its subsidiaries maintain non contributory defined benefit retirement plans 
the plans cover most us employees using a cash balance formula 
under a cash balance formula  a plan participant accumulates a retirement benefit consisting of pay credits that are based upon a percentage which may vary with age and years of service of current eligible earnings and current interest credits 
certain employees are covered under plans that use a final average earnings formula 
under a final average earnings formula  a plan participant accumulates a retirement benefit equal to a percentage of their highest year average earnings  plus a percentage of their highest year average earnings in excess of covered compensation per year of participation maximum of years  plus a percentage of their highest year average earnings times years of participation in excess of years 
duke energy also maintains non qualified  non contributory defined benefit retirement plans which cover certain executives 
duke energy and most of its subsidiaries also provide some health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees on a contributory and non contributory basis 
certain employees are eligible for these benefits if they have met age and service requirements at retirement  as defined in the plans 
duke energy recognized pre tax qualified pension cost of million in in  duke energy s pre tax qualified pension cost is expected to be million higher than in resulting primarily from an increase in net actuarial loss amortization  primarily attributable to the effect of negative actual returns on assets from duke energy recognized pre tax nonqualified pension cost of million and pre tax other post retirement benefits cost of million  in in  pre tax non qualified pension cost is expected to be approximately the same amount as in in  pre tax other post retirement benefits costs are expected to be approximately million lower than in resulting primarily from an increase in net actuarial gain accretion and a decrease in net transition obligation amortization 
for both pension and other post retirement plans  duke energy assumes that its plan s assets will generate a long term rate of return of as of december  the assets for duke energy s pension and other post retirement plans are maintained in a master trust 
the investment objective of the master trust is to achieve reasonable returns on trust assets  subject to a prudent level of portfolio risk  for the purpose of enhancing the security of benefits for plan participants 
the asset allocation targets were set after considering the investment objective and the risk profile 
us equities are held for their high expected return 
non us equities  debt securities  hedge funds  real estate and other global securities are held for diversification 
investments within asset classes are to be diversified to achieve broad market participation and reduce the impact of individual managers or investments 
duke energy regularly reviews its actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances its investments to its targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
duke energy also invests other post retirement assets in the duke energy corporation employee benefits trust veba i 
the investment objective of veba i is to achieve sufficient returns  subject to a prudent level of portfolio risk  for the purpose of promoting the security of plan benefits for participants 
veba i is passively managed 
the expected long term rate of return of for the plan s assets was developed using a weighted average calculation of expected returns based primarily on future expected returns across asset classes considering the use of active asset managers 
the weighted average returns expected by asset classes were for us equities  for non us equities  for global equities  for debt securities  for global private equity  for hedge funds  for real estate and for other global securities 
duke energy discounted its future us pension and other post retirement obligations using a rate of as of december  the discount rates used to measure benefit plan benefit obligations for financial reporting purposes should reflect rates at which pension benefits could be effectively settled 
as of december   duke energy determined its discount rate for us pension and other post retirement obligations using a bond selection settlement portfolio approach 
this approach develops a discount rate by selecting a portfolio of 
table of contents part ii high quality corporate bonds that generate sufficient cash flow to provide for the projected benefit payments of the plan 
the selected bond portfolio is derived from a universe of non callable corporate bonds rated aa quality or higher 
after the bond portfolio is selected  a single interest rate is determined that equates the present value of the plan s projected benefit payments discounted at this rate with the market value of the bonds selected 
future changes in plan asset returns  assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in duke energy s pension and post retirement plans will impact duke energy s future pension expense and liabilities 
management cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future

liquidity and capital resources overview at december   duke energy had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of billion  of which billion is held in foreign jurisdictions and is forecasted to be used to fund the operations of and investments in international energy 
to fund its domestic liquidity and capital requirements  duke energy relies primarily upon cash flows from operations  borrowings  and its existing cash and cash equivalents 
the relatively stable operating cash flows of the us franchised electric and gas business segment compose a substantial portion of duke energy s cash flows from operations and it is anticipated that it will continue to do so for the foreseeable future 
a material adverse change in operations  or in available financing  could impact duke energy s ability to fund its current liquidity and capital resource requirements 
weather conditions  commodity price fluctuations and unanticipated expenses  including unplanned plant outages and storms  could affect the timing and level of internally generated funds 
ultimate cash flows from operations are subject to a number of factors  including  but not limited to  regulatory constraints  economic trends and market volatility see item a 
risk factors for details 
duke energy s projected capital and investment expenditures for the next three fiscal years are included in the table below 
in millions us franchised electric and gas commercial power  international energy and other total committed expenditures discretionary expenditures total projected capital and investment expenditures duke energy continues to focus on reducing risk and positioning its business for future success and will invest principally in its strongest business sectors 
based on this goal  the majority of duke energy s total projected capital expenditures are allocated to the us franchised electric and gas segment 
the table below includes the components of projected capital expenditures for us franchised electric and gas for the next three fiscal years 
system growth maintenance and upgrades of existing facilities nuclear fuel environmental total projected us franchised electric and gas capital expenditures 
table of contents part ii with respect to the capital expenditure plan  duke energy has flexibility within its billion budget to defer or eliminate certain spending should economic or financing conditions deteriorate 
of the billion budget  billion relates to projects for which management has committed capital  including  but not limited to  the continued construction of cliffside unit  the edwardsport igcc plant and the dan river combined cycle gas fired facilities  and management intends to spend those capital dollars in irrespective of broader economic factors 
billion of projected capital expenditures are expected to be used primarily for overall system maintenance and upgrades  customer connections  compliance with new environmental requirements and corporate capital expenditures 
although these expenditures are ultimately necessary to ensure overall system maintenance and reliability  the timing of the expenditures may be influenced by broad economic conditions and customer growth  thus management has more flexibility in terms of when these dollars are actually spent 
the remaining planned capital expenditures of billion are of a discretionary nature and relate to growth opportunities in which duke energy may invest  provided there are opportunities that meet return expectations 
as a result of duke energy s significant commitment to modernize its generating fleet through the construction of new units  the ability to cost effectively manage the construction phase of current and future projects is critical to ensuring full and timely recovery of costs of construction 
should duke energy encounter significant cost overruns above amounts approved by the various state commissions  and those amounts are disallowed for recovery in rates  or if construction cost of renewable generation exceed amounts provided through power sales agreements  future cash flows and results of operations could be adversely impacted 
many of duke energy s current capital expenditure projects  including system modernization and renewable investments  qualify for bonus depreciation 
duke energy estimates that over time it could generate cumulative cash benefits of approximately billion for projects expected to be placed in service by the end of even though bonus depreciation related to duke energy s regulated projects reduces rate base eligible for inclusion in future rates  the cash benefits will decrease duke energy s need for financings over time and help to mitigate future customer rate increases 
duke energy s capitalization is balanced between debt and equity as shown in the table below 
projected equity debt duke energy s fixed charges coverage ratio  calculated using sec guidelines  was times for  times for  and times for in  duke energy currently anticipates issuing additional net debt of million  primarily for the purpose of funding capital expenditures 
due to the flexibility in the timing of projected capital expenditures  the timing and amount of debt issuances throughout could be influenced by changes in capital spending 
in november  duke energy entered into a new billion  five year master credit facility with billion available at closing and the remaining billion available following successful completion of the proposed merger with progress energy  inc this facility is not restricted upon general market conditions 
additionally  duke energy has access to billion in a credit facility from smaller regional banks 
at december   duke energy has available borrowing capacity of billion under these facilities 
management currently believes that amounts available under its revolving credit facilities are accessible should there be a need to generate additional short term financing in management expects that cash flows from operations and issuances of debt will be sufficient to cover the funding requirements related to capital and investments expenditures  dividend payments and debt maturities 
see credit facilities section below for additional information regarding duke energy s credit facilities 
duke energy monitors compliance with all debt covenants and restrictions and does not currently believe it will be in violation or breach of its significant debt covenants during however  circumstances could arise that may alter that view 
if and when management had a belief that such potential breach could exist  appropriate action would be taken to mitigate any such issue 
duke energy also maintains an active dialogue with the credit rating agencies 
duke energy periodically evaluates the impact of repatriation of cash generated and held in foreign countries 
duke energy s current intent is to indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings 
however  circumstances could arise that may alter that view  including a future change in tax law governing us taxation of foreign earnings 
if duke energy were to decide to repatriate foreign generated and held cash  recognition of material us federal income tax liabilities could be required

the notes are offered on a continuous basis and bear interest at a floating rate per annum determined by the duke energy premiernotes committee  or its designee  on a weekly basis 
the interest rate payable on notes held by an investor may vary based on the principal amount of the investment 
the notes have no stated maturity date  but may be redeemed in whole or in part by duke energy at any time 
the notes are non transferable and may be redeemed in whole or in part at the investor s option 
proceeds from the sale of the notes will be used for general corporate purposes 
the balance as of december   is million 
the notes reflect a short term debt obligation of duke energy and are reflected as notes payable on duke energy s consolidated balance sheets 
in september  duke energy filed a form s with the sec 
under this form s  which is uncapped  duke energy  duke energy carolinas  duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana may issue debt and other securities in the future at amounts  prices and with terms to be determined at the time of future offerings 
the registration statement also allows for the issuance of common stock by duke energy 
duke energy has paid quarterly cash dividends for consecutive years and expects to continue its policy of paying regular cash dividends in the future 
there is no assurance as to the amount of future dividends because they depend on future earnings  capital requirements  financial condition and are subject to the discretion of the board of directors 
dividend and other funding restrictions of duke energy subsidiaries 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements regulatory matters  duke energy s wholly owned public utility operating companies have restrictions on the amount of funds that can be transferred to duke energy via dividend  advance or loan as a result of conditions imposed by various regulators in conjunction with duke energy s merger with cinergy 
additionally  certain other duke energy subsidiaries have other restrictions  such as minimum working capital and tangible net worth requirements pursuant to debt and other agreements that limit the amount of funds that can be transferred to duke energy 
at december   the amount of restricted net assets of wholly owned subsidiaries of duke energy that may not be distributed to duke energy in the form of a loan or dividend is billion 
however  duke energy does not have any legal or other restrictions on paying common stock dividends to shareholders out of its consolidated retained earnings account 
although these restrictions cap the amount of funding the various operating subsidiaries can provide to duke energy  management does not believe these restrictions will have any significant impact on duke energy s ability to access cash to meet its payment of dividends on common stock and other future funding obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements duke energy and certain of its subsidiaries enter into guarantee arrangements in the normal course of business to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties 
these arrangements include performance guarantees  stand by letters of credit  debt guarantees  surety bonds and indemnifications 
most of the guarantee arrangements entered into by duke energy enhance the credit standing of certain subsidiaries  non consolidated entities or less than wholly owned entities  enabling them to conduct business 
as such  these guarantee arrangements involve elements of performance and credit risk  which are not included on the consolidated balance sheets 
the possibility of duke energy  either on its own or on behalf of spectra energy capital  llc spectra capital through indemnification agreements entered into as part of the spin off 
table of contents part ii of spectra energy corp spectra energy  having to honor its contingencies is largely dependent upon the future operations of the subsidiaries  investees and other third parties  or the occurrence of certain future events 
duke energy performs ongoing assessments of its guarantee obligations to determine whether any liabilities have been triggered as a result of potential increased non performance risk by parties for which duke energy has issued guarantees 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  guarantees and indemnifications  for further details of the guarantee arrangements 
issuance of these guarantee arrangements is not required for the majority of duke energy s operations 
thus  if duke energy discontinued issuing these guarantees  there would not be a material impact to the consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
other than the guarantee arrangements discussed above and normal operating lease arrangements  duke energy does not have any material off balance sheet financing entities or structures 
for additional information on these commitments  see note to the consolidated financial statements  commitments and contingencies 

table of contents part ii contractual obligations duke energy enters into contracts that require payment of cash at certain specified periods  based on certain specified minimum quantities and prices 
the following table summarizes duke energy s contractual cash obligations for each of the periods presented 
contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years thereafter in millions long term debt a capital leases b operating leases b purchase obligations h firm capacity and transportation payments c commodity contracts d other purchase  maintenance and service obligations e other funding obligations f total contractual cash obligations g a see note to the consolidated financial statements  debt and credit facilities 
amount includes interest payments over the life of the debt 
interest payments on variable rate debt instruments were calculated using interest rates derived from the interpolation of the forecast interest rate curve 
in addition  a spread was placed on top of the interest rates to aid in capturing the volatility inherent in projecting future interest rates 
b see note to the consolidated financial statements  commitments and contingencies 
amounts in the table above include the interest component of capital leases based on the interest rates explicitly stated in the lease agreements 
c includes firm capacity payments that provide duke energy with uninterrupted firm access to electricity transmission capacity  and natural gas transportation contracts 
d includes contractual obligations to purchase physical quantities of electricity  coal  nuclear fuel and limestone 
also  includes contracts that duke energy has designated as hedges  undesignated contracts and contracts that qualify as normal purchase normal sale npns 
for contracts where the price paid is based on an index  the amount is based on forward market prices at december  for certain of these amounts  duke energy may settle on a net cash basis since duke energy has entered into payment netting agreements with counterparties that permit duke energy to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties 
e includes contracts for software  telephone  data and consulting or advisory services 
amount also includes contractual obligations for engineering  procurement and construction costs for new generation plants and nuclear plant refurbishments  environmental projects on fossil facilities  major maintenance of certain non regulated plants  maintenance and day to day contract work at certain wind facilities and commitments to buy wind and combustion turbines ct 
amount excludes certain open purchase orders for services that are provided on demand  for which the timing of the purchase cannot be determined 
f relates to future annual funding obligations to the nuclear decommissioning trust fund ndtf see note to the consolidated financial statements  asset retirement obligations 
g the table above excludes certain obligations discussed herein related to amounts recorded within deferred credits and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount of future cash flows necessary to settle these obligations 
the amount of cash flows to be paid to settle the asset retirement obligations is not known with certainty as duke energy may use internal resources or external resources to perform retirement activities 
as a result  cash obligations for asset retirement activities are excluded from the table above 
however  the vast majority of asset retirement obligations will be settled beyond asset retirement obligations recognized on the consolidated balance sheets total  million and the fair value of the ndtf  which will be used to help fund these obligations  is  million at december  the table above excludes reserves for litigation  environmental remediation  asbestos related injuries and damages claims and self insurance claims see note to the consolidated financial statements  commitments and contingencies because duke energy is uncertain as to the timing of when cash payments will be required 
additionally  the table above excludes annual insurance premiums that are necessary to operate the business  including nuclear insurance see note to the consolidated financial statements  commitments and contingencies  funding of pension and other post retirement benefit plans see note to the consolidated financial statements  employee benefit plans and regulatory liabilities see note to the consolidated financial statements  regulatory matters because the amount and timing of the cash payments are uncertain 
also excluded are deferred income taxes and investment tax credits recorded on the consolidated balance sheets since cash payments for income taxes are determined based primarily on taxable income for each discrete fiscal year 
additionally  amounts related to uncertain tax positions are excluded from the table above due to uncertainty of timing of future payments 
h current liabilities  except for current maturities of long term debt  and purchase obligations reflected in the consolidated balance sheets  have been excluded from the above table 

table of contents part ii quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management policies the duke energy registrants are exposed to market risks associated with commodity prices  credit exposure  interest rates  equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
management has established comprehensive risk management policies to monitor and manage these market risks 
duke energy s chief executive officer and chief financial officer are responsible for the overall approval of market risk management policies and the delegation of approval and authorization levels 
the finance and risk management committee of the board of directors receives periodic updates from the chief risk officer and other members of management on market risk positions  corporate exposures  credit exposures and overall risk management activities 
the chief risk officer is responsible for the overall governance of managing credit risk and commodity price risk  including monitoring exposure limits 
commodity price risk the duke energy registrants are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the prices of electricity  coal  natural gas and other energy related products marketed and purchased as a result of its ownership of energy related assets 
the duke energy registrants exposure to these fluctuations is limited by the cost based regulation of its us franchised electric and gas operations as these regulated operations are typically allowed to recover certain of these costs through various cost recovery clauses  including fuel clauses 
while there may be a delay in timing between when these costs are incurred and when these costs are recovered through rates  changes from year to year generally do not have a material impact on operating results of these regulated operations 
price risk represents the potential risk of loss from adverse changes in the market price of electricity or other energy commodities 
the duke energy registrants exposure to commodity price risk is influenced by a number of factors  including contract size  length  market liquidity  location and unique or specific contract terms 
the duke energy registrants employ established policies and procedures to manage the risks associated with these market fluctuations  which may include using various commodity derivatives  such as swaps  futures  forwards and options 
for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements  risk management  derivative instruments and hedging activities 
validation of a contract s fair value is performed by an internal group separate from the duke energy registrants deal origination areas 
while the duke energy registrants use common industry practices to develop their valuation techniques  changes in their pricing methodologies or the underlying assumptions could result in significantly different fair values and income recognition 
hedging strategies 
the duke energy registrants closely monitor the risks associated with commodity price changes on their future operations and  where appropriate  use various commodity instruments such as electricity  coal and natural gas forward contracts to mitigate the effect of such fluctuations on operations  in addition to optimizing the value of the non regulated generation portfolio 
duke energy s primary use of energy commodity derivatives is to hedge the generation portfolio against exposure to the prices of power and fuel 
the majority of derivatives used to manage the duke energy registrants commodity price exposure are either not designated as a hedge or do not qualify for hedge accounting 
these instruments are referred to as undesignated contracts 
mark to market changes for undesignated contracts entered into by regulated businesses are reflected as a regulatory asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets 
undesignated contracts entered into by unregulated businesses are marked to market each period  with changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments reflected in earnings 
certain derivatives used to manage the duke energy registrants commodity price exposure are accounted for as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges 
to the extent that instruments accounted for as hedges are effective in offsetting the transaction being hedged  there is no impact to the consolidated statements of operations until after delivery or settlement occurs 
accordingly  assumptions and valuation techniques for these contracts have no impact on reported earnings prior to settlement 
several factors influence the effectiveness of a hedge contract  including the use of contracts with different commodities or unmatched terms and counterparty credit risk 
hedge effectiveness is monitored regularly and measured at least quarterly 
in addition to the hedge contracts described above and recorded on the consolidated balance sheets  the duke energy registrants enter into other contracts that qualify for the npns exception 
when a contract meets the criteria to qualify as an npns  us franchised electric and gas and commercial power apply such exception 
income recognition and realization related to npns contracts generally coincide with the physical delivery of power 
for contracts qualifying for the npns exception  no recognition of the contract s fair value in the consolidated financial statements is required until settlement of the contract as long as the transaction remains probable of occurring 
generation portfolio risks 
the duke energy registrants are primarily exposed to market price fluctuations of wholesale power  natural gas  and coal prices in the us franchised electric and gas and commercial power segments 
the duke energy registrants optimize the value of their wholesale and non regulated generation portfolios 
the portfolios include generation assets power and capacity  fuel  and emission allowances 
modeled forecasts of future generation output  fuel requirements  and emission allowance requirements are based on forward power  fuel and emission allowance markets 
the component pieces of the portfolio are bought and sold based on models and forecasts of generation in order to manage the economic value of the portfolio in accordance with the strategies of the business units 
for duke energy carolinas and duke energy indiana  as well as the kentucky regulated generation owned by duke energy ohio  the generation portfolio not utilized to serve retail operations or committed load is subject to commodity price fluctuations  although the impact on the consolidated statements of operations is partially offset by mechanisms in these regulated jurisdictions that result in the sharing of net profits from these activities with retail customers 
duke energy ohio is subject to wholesale commodity price risks for its non regulated coal fired and gas fired generation portfolio 
the non regulated generation portfolio dispatches all of their electricity into unregulated markets and receives wholesale energy margins and capacity revenues from pjm 
duke energy ohio has fully hedged its forecasted coal fired generation for capacity revenues are contracted in pjm through may international energy generally hedges its expected generation using long term bilateral power sales contracts when favorable market conditions exist and it is subject to wholesale commodity price risks for electricity not sold under such contracts 
international energy dispatches electricity not sold under long term bilateral contracts into unregulated markets and receives wholesale energy margins and capacity revenues from national system operators 
derivative contracts executed to manage generation portfolio risks for delivery periods beyond are also exposed to changes in fair value due to market price fluctuations of wholesale power and coal 
see sensitivity analysis for generation portfolio and derivative price risks below  for more information regarding the effect of changes in commodity prices on the duke energy registrants net income 
other commodity risks 
at december   pre tax income in was not expected to be materially impacted for exposures to other commodities price changes 
sensitivity analysis for generation portfolio and derivative price risks the table below summarizes the estimated effect of commodity price changes on the duke energy registrants pre tax net income  based on a sensitivity analysis performed as of december  and december  for duke energy and duke energy ohio

b amounts represent sensitivities related to derivative contracts executed to manage generation portfolio risks for periods beyond amounts exclude the potential impact of commodity price changes on forecasted economic generation and fuel needed to achieve such forecasted generation 
credit risk credit risk represents the loss that the duke energy registrants would incur if a counterparty fails to perform under its contractual obligations 
to reduce credit exposure  the duke energy registrants seek to enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit them to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties 
the duke energy registrants attempt to further reduce credit risk with certain counterparties by entering into agreements that enable obtaining collateral or terminating or resetting the terms of transactions after specified time periods or upon the occurrence of credit related events 
the duke energy registrants may  at times  use credit derivatives or other structures and techniques to provide for third party credit enhancement of their counterparties obligations 
the duke energy registrants also obtain cash or letters of credit from customers to provide credit support outside of collateral agreements  where appropriate  based on a financial analysis of the customer and the regulatory or contractual terms and conditions applicable to each transaction 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  risk management  derivative instruments and hedging activities  for additional information regarding credit risk related to derivative instruments 
the duke energy registrants industry has historically operated under negotiated credit lines for physical delivery contracts 
the duke energy registrants frequently use master collateral agreements to mitigate certain credit exposures 
the collateral agreements provide for a counterparty to post cash or letters of credit to the exposed party for exposure in excess of an established threshold 
the threshold amount represents a negotiated unsecured credit limit for each party to the agreement  determined in accordance with the duke energy registrants internal corporate credit practices and standards 
collateral agreements generally also provide that the inability to post collateral is sufficient cause to terminate contracts and liquidate all positions 
the duke energy registrants principal customers for its electric and gas businesses are commodity clearinghouses  regional transmission organizations  industrial end users  marketers  distribution companies  municipalities  electric cooperatives and utilities located throughout the us and latin america 
the duke energy registrants have concentrations of receivables from such entities throughout these regions 
these concentrations of customers may affect the duke energy registrants overall credit risk in that risk factors can negatively impact the credit quality of the entire sector 
where exposed to credit risk  the duke energy registrants analyze the counterparties financial condition prior to entering into an agreement  establish credit limits and monitor the appropriateness of those limits on an ongoing basis 
duke energy has a third party insurance policy to cover certain losses related to duke energy carolinas asbestos related injuries and damages above an aggregate self insured retention of million 
duke energy carolinas cumulative payments began to exceed the self insurance retention on its insurance policy during the second quarter of future payments up to the policy limit will be reimbursed by duke energy s third party insurance carrier 
the insurance policy limit for potential future insurance recoveries for indemnification and medical cost claim payments is million in excess of the self insured retention 
insurance recoveries of million and million related to this policy are classified in the consolidated balance sheets in other within investments and other assets and receivables as of december  and  respectively 
duke energy is not aware of any uncertainties regarding the legal sufficiency of insurance claims 
management believes the insurance recovery asset is probable of recovery as the insurance carrier continues to have a strong financial strength rating 
the duke energy registrants also have credit risk exposure through issuance of performance guarantees  letters of credit and surety bonds on behalf of less than wholly owned entities and third parties 
where the duke energy registrants have issued these guarantees  it is possible that the duke energy registrants could be required to perform under these guarantee obligations in the event the obligor under the guarantee fails to perform 
where the duke energy registrants have issued guarantees related to assets or operations that have been disposed of via sale  they attempt to secure indemnification from the buyer against all future performance obligations under the guarantees 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  guarantees and indemnifications  for further information on guarantees issued by duke energy or its subsidiaries 
the duke energy registrants are also subject to credit risk of their vendors and suppliers in the form of performance risk on contracts including  but not limited to  outsourcing arrangements  major construction projects and commodity purchases 
the duke energy registrants credit exposure to such vendors and suppliers may take the form of increased costs or project delays in the event of non performance 

table of contents part ii based on the duke energy registrants policies for managing credit risk  their exposures and their credit and other reserves  the duke energy registrants do not currently anticipate a materially adverse effect on their consolidated financial position or results of operations as a result of non performance by any counterparty 
retail 
credit risk associated with the duke energy registrants service to residential  commercial and industrial customers is generally limited to outstanding accounts receivable 
the duke energy registrants mitigate this credit risk by requiring customers to provide a cash deposit or letter of credit until a satisfactory payment history is established  at which time the deposit is typically refunded 
charge offs for retail customers have historically been insignificant to the operations of the duke energy registrants and are typically recovered through the retail rates 
management continually monitors customer charge offs and payment patterns to ensure the adequacy of bad debt reserves 
duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana sell certain of their accounts receivable and related collections through crc  a duke energy consolidated variable interest entity 
losses on collection are first absorbed by the equity of crc and next by the subordinated retained interests held by duke energy ohio  duke energy kentucky and duke energy indiana 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  variable interest entities 
wholesale sales 
to reduce credit exposure related to wholesale sales  the duke energy registrants seeks to enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit the duke energy registrants to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties 
the duke energy registrants attempt to further reduce credit risk with certain counterparties by entering into agreements that enable the duke energy registrants to obtain collateral or to terminate or reset the terms of transactions after specified time periods or upon the occurrence of credit related events 
european exposures 
duke energy owns a ownership interest in attiki  a natural gas distributor located in athens  greece 
the carrying value of duke energy s investment in attiki was million at december   and is recorded in other within investments and other assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
duke energy also has a million debt obligation associated with its investment in attiki 
duke energy has an agreement to sell its ownership interest in attiki 
if all conditions of this agreement are met  duke energy expects the transaction to close in march at december   duke energy held million of money market funds and short term investments in investment grade debt securities of issued by financial and nonfinancial institutions that are domiciled in europe or have exposures to european sovereign debt 
this amount is recorded at fair value and included in cash and cash equivalents and short term investment in the consolidated balance sheets 
a disorderly default by the greek government or withdrawal of greece from the euro zone and financial stress in other european countries could require duke energy to recognize an impairment of some or all of these securities 
interest rate risk the duke energy registrants are exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of their issuance of variable and fixed rate debt and commercial paper 
the duke energy registrants manage interest rate exposure by limiting variable rate exposures to a percentage of total capitalization and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates 
the duke energy registrants also enter into financial derivative instruments  which may include instruments such as  but not limited to  interest rate swaps  swaptions and us treasury lock agreements to manage and mitigate interest rate risk exposure 
see notes    and to the consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies  debt and credit facilities  risk management  derivative instruments and hedging activities  and fair value of financial assets and liabilities 
the table below summarizes the potential effect of interest rate changes on the duke energy registrants pre tax net income  based on a sensitivity analysis performed as of december  and december  summary of sensitivity analysis for interest rate risks in millions potential increase or decrease in interest expense a assuming market interest rates average higher or lower in than in assuming market interest rates average higher or lower in than in as of december  as of december  duke energy duke energy carolinas duke energy ohio duke energy indiana a amounts presented net of offsetting impacts in interest income 
these amounts were estimated by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on variable rate securities outstanding  adjusted for interest rate hedges  short term and long term investments  cash and cash equivalents outstanding as of december  and the change in interest rate sensitivity for the duke energy registrants is primarily due to changes in short term debt balances and cash balances 
if interest rates changed significantly  management would likely take actions to manage its exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in the duke energy registrants financial structure 
marketable securities price risk duke energy as described further in note to the consolidated financial statements  investments in debt and equity securities  duke energy invests in debt and equity securities as part of various investment portfolios to fund certain obligations of the business 
the vast majority of the investments in equity securities are within the ndtf and assets of the various pension and other post retirement benefit plans 
pension plan assets 
duke energy maintains investments to help fund the costs of providing non contributory defined benefit retirement and other post retirement benefit plans 
these investments are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and changes in interest rates 
the equity securities held in duke energy s pension plans are diversified to achieve broad market participation and reduce the impact of any single investment  sector or geographic region 
duke energy has established asset allocation targets for its pension plan 
table of contents part ii holdings  which take into consideration the investment objectives and the risk profile with respect to the trust in which the assets are held 
these target allocations are presented in the table below 
target asset allocation for pension plan assets asset target allocation equity securities debt securities other a significant decline in the value of plan asset holdings could require duke energy to increase its funding of the pension plan in future periods  which could adversely affect cash flows in those periods 
additionally  a decline in the fair value of plan assets  absent additional cash contributions to the plan  could increase the amount of pension cost required to be recorded in future periods  which could adversely affect duke energy s results of operations in those periods 
the subsidiary registrants proportionate share of duke energy s costs of providing non contributory defined benefit retirement and other post retirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors  such as the rates of return on plan assets  discount rate  the rate of increase in health care costs and contributions made to the plans 
during  duke energy contributed million to its qualified pension plan of which million was funded by duke energy carolinas  million was funded by duke energy ohio and million was funded by duke energy indiana 
duke energy intends to contribute million to its qualified pension plan in see note to the consolidated financial statements  employee benefit plans  for additional information on pension plan assets 
ndtf 
as required by the nrc and the ncuc  duke energy carolinas maintains trust funds to fund the costs of nuclear decommissioning see note to the consolidated financial statements  asset retirement obligations 
as of december   these funds were invested primarily in domestic and international equity securities  debt securities  fixed income securities  cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
per the nrc and the ncuc requirements  these funds may be used only for activities related to nuclear decommissioning 
the investments in equity securities are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets 
accounting for nuclear decommissioning recognizes that costs are recovered through duke energy carolinas rates  therefore  fluctuations in equity prices do not affect duke energy carolinas consolidated statements of operations as changes in the fair value of these investments are deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities pursuant to an order by the ncuc 
earnings or losses of the fund will ultimately impact the amount of costs recovered through duke energy carolinas rates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  asset retirement obligations for additional information regarding nuclear decommissioning costs 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  investments in debt and equity securities for additional information regarding ntdf assets 
foreign currency risk duke energy is exposed to foreign currency risk from investments in international affiliate businesses owned and operated in foreign countries and from certain commodity related transactions within domestic operations that are denominated in foreign currencies 
to mitigate risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations  contracts may be denominated in or indexed to the us dollar inflation rates and or local inflation rates  or investments may be naturally hedged through debt denominated or issued in the foreign currency 
duke energy may also use foreign currency derivatives  where possible  to manage its risk related to foreign currency fluctuations 
to monitor its currency exchange rate risks  duke energy uses sensitivity analysis  which measures the impact of devaluation of the foreign currencies to which it has exposure 
in  duke energy s primary foreign currency rate exposure was to the brazilian real

global climate change and other epa regulations under development 
the epa publishes an inventory of man made us greenhouse gas ghg emissions annually 
in  the most recent year reported  carbon dioxide co  a byproduct of all sources of combustion  accounted for approximately of total us ghg emissions 
the duke energy registrants ghg emissions consist primarily of co and most come from its fleet of coal fired power plants in the us in  the duke energy registrants us power plants emitted approximately million tons of co the co emissions from duke energy s international electric operations were approximately million tons 
the duke energy registrants future co emissions will be influenced by variables including new regulations  economic conditions that affect electricity demand  and the duke energy registrants decisions regarding generation technologies deployed to meet customer electricity needs 
the duke energy registrants believe it is highly unlikely that legislation mandating reductions in ghg emissions will be passed by the th congress which ends at the end of beyond the prospects for enactment of any federal legislation mandating reductions in ghg emissions is highly uncertain 
given the high degree of uncertainty surrounding potential future mandatory federal ghg emission reduction l legislation  management cannot predict if or when such legislation might be enacted  what the requirements of any potential legislation might be  or the potential impact it might have on the duke energy registrants 
among the outcomes of the th conference of the parties of the united nations framework convention on climate change was a decision by the participating countries to adopt a universal legal agreement no later than to be put into place by the conference  which was held in durban  south africa  again revealed significant differences of opinion amongst nations  particularly between developed and developing economies  but there was agreement to continue the search for common ground 
the non binding pledge to reach agreement by was reached only after delegates agreed to extend the conference an extra day 
the international climate change negotiating process is highly uncertain and management cannot predict what the outcome might be or the potential impact it might have on the duke energy registrants 
on december   the epa finalized an endangerment finding for greenhouse gases under the clean air act caa 
the endangerment finding did not impose any regulatory requirements on the electric utility industry  but it was a necessary prerequisite for the epa to be able to finalize several subsequent ghg rules 
a subsequent epa regulation of ghgs from mobile sources issued in resulted in ghgs being pollutants subject to regulation under the caa  thereby subjecting newly constructed and modified stationary sources to the caa s prevention of significant deterioration psd permitting program for increases in ghgs 
without any changes  the caa requirements would have subjected tens of thousands of additional stationary sources of ghg emissions to psd permitting requirements 
to avoid this result  the epa issued the tailoring rule on june  under the tailoring rule  new major stationary sources of ghgs and existing major stationary sources of ghgs that undertake a modification that will result in a net ghg emissions increase of at least  tons per year are subject to ghg permitting requirements under the psd permitting program 
all of the duke energy registrants existing coal fired generating units and several of its natural gas fired generating units are major sources of ghg emissions 
the psd permitting program requires sources that trigger psd permitting requirements for ghgs to perform a best available control technology bact analysis for ghg emissions to determine what  if any  actions must be taken at the source to limit its ghg emissions 
in each of the states in which the duke energy registrants operates major stationary sources of ghg emissions  the state is the permitting authority for the psd program 
this means that the states will ultimately determine the bact requirements that will apply in the event a duke energy registrant triggers psd permitting requirements for ghg emissions at any of its new or existing facilities 
greenhouse gas psd permitting requirements and the application of bact to limit ghg emissions do not apply to any existing source that does not undertake a modification resulting in a net ghg emissions increase of at least  tons per year 
while the duke energy registrants do not anticipate taking actions that would trigger the psd permitting requirements for ghgs at any of its existing generating facilities or facilities currently under construction  if it were to do so  management does not believe that it would have a material impact on the duke energy registrants future results of operations 
numerous entities have filed petitions with the dc circuit court of appeals for review of epa s endangerment finding and tailoring rule 
management cannot predict the outcome of the litigation 
oral arguments in the case are scheduled for february and  a decision in the case is likely in the second or third quarter of on march   the epa entered into a settlement agreement requiring it to propose by july   this date was later revised to september  and finalize by may   a rule to establish ghg emission standards new source performance standards  or nsps for new fossil fueled electric generating units and existing fossil fueled electric generating units that undertake a major modification 
the settlement agreement also required the epa to issue on the same schedule emission guidelines for states for their use in developing plans for reducing ghg emissions at existing fossil fueled electric generating units that do not undertake a major modification 
recent developments indicate that the epa will first propose a nsps rule that covers new and possibly modified sources  in early under the nsps program  the rule takes effect upon proposal 
there is no indication when the epa might issue proposed emission guidelines for existing sources 
the outcome of these pending epa regulatory actions is uncertain and management cannot determine at this time if they will have a material impact on the duke energy registrants future results of operations or cash flows 
the duke energy registrants do not anticipate any of the states in which it currently operates fossil fueled electric generating units to take action absent a federal requirement to mandate reductions in ghg emissions from these facilities 
the duke energy registrants are taking actions today that will result in reduced ghg emissions over time 
these actions will lower the duke energy registrants exposure to any future mandatory ghg emission reduction requirements  whether a result of federal legislation or epa regulation 
under any future scenario involving mandatory ghg limitations  the duke energy registrants would plan to seek recovery of their compliance costs through appropriate regulatory mechanisms in the jurisdictions in which it operates 
the duke energy registrants recognize that certain groups associate severe weather events with climate change  and forecast the possibility that these weather events could have a material impact on future results of operations should they occur more frequently and with greater severity 
however  the uncertain nature of potential changes of extreme weather events such as increased frequency  duration  and severity  the long period of time over which any potential changes might take place  and the inability to predict these with any degree of accuracy  make estimating any potential future financial risk to the duke energy registrants operations that may result from the physical risks of potential changes in the frequency and or severity of extreme weather events  whatever the cause or causes might be  impossible 
currently  the duke energy registrants plan and prepare for extreme weather events that it experiences from time to time  such as ice storms  tornados  hurricanes  severe thunderstorms  high winds and droughts 
the duke energy registrants past experiences preparing for and responding to the impacts of these types of weather related events would reasonably be expected to help management plan and prepare for future severe weather events to reduce  but not eliminate  the operational  economic and financial impacts of such events 
for example  the duke energy registrants routinely take steps to reduce the potential impact of severe weather events on its electric distribution systems 
the duke energy registrants electric generating facilities are designed to withstand extreme weather events without significant damage 
the duke energy registrants maintain an inventory of coal and oil on site to mitigate the effects of any potential short term disruption in its fuel supply so it can continue to provide its customers with an uninterrupted supply of electricity 
the duke energy

the duke energy registrants do not currently operate in coastal areas and therefore are not exposed to the effects of potential sea level rise 
other epa regulations recently published and under development 
the epa has issued and is in various stages of developing several non greenhouse gas non ghg environmental regulations that will affect the duke energy registrants 
these include the final cross state air pollution rule csapr and the final mercury and air toxics standards mats  previously referred to as the utility mact rule for hazardous air pollutants  as well as proposed regulations for cooling water intake structures under the clean water act b and proposed regulations for coal combustion residuals 
as a group  these non ghg environmental regulations will require the duke energy registrants to install additional environmental controls and accelerate retirement of some coal fired units 
while the ultimate regulatory requirements for the duke energy registrants from the group of epa regulatory actions will not be known until all the rules have been finalized  for planning purposes  the duke energy registrants currently estimate the cost of new control equipment that may need to be installed to comply with this group of rules could total billion to billion over the next years 
the duke energy registrants also expect to incur increased fuel  purchased power  operation and maintenance  and other expenses in conjunction with the non ghg epa regulations 
in addition to the planned retirements associated with new generation the duke energy registrants are constructing  the duke energy registrants are planning to retire additional coal fired generating capacity that is not economic to bring into compliance with the epa s regulations 
beyond  total planned and additional retirements could exceed  mw of coal fired generating capacity with  mw required by the end of per the cliffside settlement agreement as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statement  commitments and contingencies 
until the final regulatory requirements of the group of epa regulations are known and can be fully evaluated  the potential compliance costs associated with these epa regulatory actions are subject to considerable uncertainty 
therefore  the actual compliance costs incurred and mw to be retired may be materially different from these estimates based on the timing and requirements of the final epa regulations
