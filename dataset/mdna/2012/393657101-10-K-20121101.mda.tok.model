item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary we operate in three primary business segments manufacturing  wheel services  refurbishment parts  and leasing services 
these three business segments are operationally integrated 
the manufacturing segment  operating from facilities in the united states  mexico and poland  produces double stack intermodal railcars  conventional railcars  tank cars and marine vessels 
the wheel services  refurbishment parts segment performs wheel  axle and bearing servicing  railcar repair  refurbishment and maintenance activities  as well as production and reconditioning of a variety of parts for the railroad industry in north america 
the leasing services segment owns approximately  railcars and provides management services for approximately  railcars for railroads  shippers  carriers  institutional investors and other leasing and transportation companies in north america 
we also produce rail castings through an unconsolidated joint venture 
management evaluates segment performance based on margins 
multi year supply agreements are a part of rail industry practice 
customer orders may be subject to cancellations or modifications and contain terms and conditions customary in the industry 
in most cases  little variation has been experienced between the quantity ordered and the quantity actually delivered 
our total manufacturing backlog of railcars as of august  was approximately  units with an estimated value of billion compared to  units with an estimated value of billion as of august  based on current production plans  approximately  units in the august  backlog are scheduled for delivery in the balance of the production is scheduled for delivery through a portion of the orders included in backlog reflects an assumed product mix 
under terms of the orders  the exact mix will be determined in the future which may impact the dollar amount of backlog 
our railcar and marine backlogs are not necessarily indicative of future results of operations 
marine backlog as of august  was approximately million compared to no backlog as of august  in addition  we signed a letter of intent for barges valued at million subject to significant permitting and other conditions 
the continued global strengthening of the freight car markets may at times limit the availability of certain components of our products that we source from external suppliers  particularly specialized components such as castings  bolsters and trucks  and this may cause an interruption in production 
prices for steel  a primary component of railcars and barges  and related surcharges have fluctuated significantly and remain volatile 
in addition  the price of certain railcar components  which are a product of steel  are affected by steel price fluctuations 
new railcar and marine backlog generally either includes fixed price contracts which anticipate material price increases and surcharges  or contracts that contain actual or formulaic pass through of material price increases and surcharges 
we are aggressively working to mitigate these exposures 
the company s integrated business model has helped offset some of the effects of fluctuating steel and scrap steel prices  as a portion of our business segments currently benefit from rising steel scrap prices while other segments benefit from lower steel and scrap steel prices through enhanced margins 
results of operations the accounting policies of the three segments in which we operate are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies 
segment performance is evaluated based on margin 
the company s integrated business model results in selling and administrative costs being intertwined among the segments 
currently  greenbrier s management does not allocate these costs for either external or internal reporting purposes

the decrease in compared to margins was primarily due to a change in product mix which generates higher revenues with no corresponding increase in margin dollars  an increasingly competitive market place and higher freight costs 
these decreases were partially offset by higher scrap metal prices  improved efficiencies for repair due to higher activity levels and metal scrapping programs that were in effect for only a portion of during the third quarter of  we discovered that our mexico city wheel shop shipped a number of wheel sets which do not conform to aar mounting standards 
the non conforming wheel sets were used principally at our mexico city repair shop and on some new railcars manufactured at our gunderson gimsa facility 
we conducted a review of our other wheel shops and found no indication of non conformance in those shops 
we have identified a total of approximately non conforming wheel sets at our mexico city wheel shop which could represent a risk of failure 
we are working with the aar and our customers to remove and replace these wheel sets as soon as possible and  through the end of october  approximately wheel sets have been replaced or released 
we currently believe the costs associated with removing and replacing these approximately wheel sets are not likely to exceed approximately million which was expensed in we have also identified approximately an additional  wheel sets at our mexico city wheel shop that vary from aar mounting standards  but which we believe do not compromise the safe operation of the railcar or require immediate removal and replacement 
while the potential costs associated with these wheel sets cannot presently be determined  we do not anticipate that these costs will be material to our results of operations 
leasing services segment leasing services revenue was million  million and million for the years ended august   and the million increase in revenue in compared to was primarily the result of an increase in the size of the owned leased fleet and higher rents earned on increased volumes of leased railcars for syndication  partially offset by the expiration of a certain management services contract in the million decrease in revenue in compared to was primarily the result of the expiration of a certain management services contract which was partially offset by higher rents earned on leased railcars for syndication and improved lease rates and increased utilization

the warrants were issued in in connection with a term loan to greenbrier that was repaid in june we have operations in mexico and poland that conduct business in their local currencies as well as other regional currencies 
to mitigate the exposure to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency  we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to protect the margin on a portion of forecast foreign currency sales primarily in euro 
foreign operations give rise to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have off balance sheet arrangements that have or are likely to have a material current or future effect on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires judgment on the part of management to arrive at estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently uncertain 
these estimates may affect the amount of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities within the financial statements 
estimates and assumptions are periodically evaluated and may be adjusted in future periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
income taxes for financial reporting purposes  income tax expense is estimated based on planned tax return filings 
the amounts anticipated to be reported in those filings may change between the time the financial statements are prepared and the time the tax returns are filed 
further  because tax filings are subject to review by taxing authorities  there is also the risk that a position taken in preparation of a tax return may be challenged by a taxing authority 
if the taxing authority is successful in asserting a position different than that taken by us  differences in tax expense or between current and deferred tax items may arise in future periods 
such differences  which could have a material impact on our financial statements  would be reflected in the financial statements when management considers them probable of occurring and the amount reasonably estimable 
valuation allowances reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized 
our estimates of the realization of deferred tax assets is based on the information available at the time the financial statements are prepared and may include estimates of future income and other assumptions that are inherently uncertain 
maintenance obligations we are responsible for maintenance on a portion of the managed and owned lease fleet under the terms of maintenance obligations defined in the underlying lease or management agreement 
the estimated maintenance liability is based on maintenance histories for each type and age of railcar 
these estimates involve judgment as to the future costs of repairs and the types and timing of repairs required over the lease term 
as we cannot predict with certainty the prices  timing and volume of maintenance needed in the future on railcars under long term leases  this estimate is uncertain and could be materially different from maintenance requirements 
the liability is periodically reviewed and updated based on maintenance trends and known future repair or refurbishment requirements 
these adjustments could be material due to the inherent uncertainty in predicting future maintenance requirements 
warranty accruals warranty costs to cover a defined warranty period are estimated and charged to operations 
the estimated warranty cost is based on historical warranty claims for each particular product type 
for new product types without a warranty history  preliminary estimates are based on historical information for similar product types 
these estimates are inherently uncertain as they are based on historical data for existing products and judgment for new products 
if warranty claims are made in the current period for issues that have not historically been the subject of warranty claims and were not taken into consideration in establishing the accrual or if claims for issues already considered in establishing the accrual exceed expectations  warranty expense may exceed the accrual for that particular product 
conversely  there is the possibility that claims may be lower than estimates 
the warranty accrual is periodically reviewed and updated based on warranty trends 
however  as we cannot predict future claims  the potential exists for the difference in any one reporting period to be material 
environmental costs at times we may be involved in various proceedings related to environmental matters 
we estimate future costs for known environmental remediation requirements and accrue for them when it is probable that we have incurred a liability and the related costs can be reasonably estimated based on currently available information 
if further developments or resolution of an environmental matter result in facts and circumstances that are significantly different than the assumptions used to develop these reserves  the accrual for environmental the greenbrier companies annual report 
table of contents remediation could be materially understated or overstated 
adjustments to these liabilities are made when additional information becomes available that affects the estimated costs to study or remediate any environmental issues or when expenditures for which reserves are established are made 
due to the uncertain nature of estimating potential environmental matters  there can be no assurance that we will not become involved in future litigation or other proceedings or  if we were found to be responsible or liable in any litigation or proceeding  that such costs would not be material to us 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
railcars are generally manufactured  repaired or refurbished and wheel services and parts produced under firm orders from third parties 
revenue is recognized when these products or services are completed  accepted by an unaffiliated customer and contractual contingencies removed 
certain leases are operated under car hire arrangements whereby revenue is earned based on utilization  car hire rates and terms specified in the lease agreement 
car hire revenue is reported from a third party source two months in arrears  however  such revenue is accrued in the month earned based on estimates of use from historical activity and is adjusted to actual as reported 
these estimates are inherently uncertain as they involve judgment as to the estimated use of each railcar 
adjustments to actual have historically not been significant 
revenues from construction of marine barges are either recognized on the percentage of completion method during the construction period or on the completed contract method based on the terms of the contract 
under the percentage of completion method  judgment is used to determine a definitive threshold against which progress towards completion can be measured to determine timing of revenue recognition 
we will periodically sell railcars with leases attached to financial investors 
in addition we will often perform management or maintenance services at market rates for these railcars 
pursuant to the guidance in asc  we evaluate the terms of any remarketing agreements and any contractual provisions that represent retained risk and the level of retained risk based on those provisions 
we apply a threshold to determine whether the level of retained risk exceeds of the individual fair value of the rail cars delivered 
for any contracts with multiple elements ie railcars  maintenance  management services  etc we allocate revenue among the deliverables primarily based upon objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of each element in the arrangement 
if objective and reliable evidence of fair value of any element is not available  we will use its estimated selling price for purposes of allocating the total arrangement consideration among the elements 
impairment of long lived assets when changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of certain long lived assets may not be recoverable  the assets are evaluated for impairment 
if the forecast undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets  an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the assets to fair value is recognized in the current period 
these estimates are based on the best information available at the time of the impairment and could be materially different if circumstances change 
if the forecast undiscounted future cash flows exceeded the carrying amount of the assets it would indicate that the assets were not impaired 
goodwill and acquired intangible assets the company periodically acquires businesses in purchase transactions in which the allocation of the purchase price may result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates affect the amount of future period amortization and possible impairment charges 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually during the third quarter 
goodwill is also tested more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicates that a potential impairment exists 
when changes in circumstances  such as a decline in the market price of our common stock  changes in demand or in the numerous variables associated with the judgments  assumptions and estimates made in assessing the appropriate valuation of goodwill indicate the carrying amount of certain indefinite lived assets may not be recoverable  the assets are evaluated for impairment 
among other things  our assumptions used in the valuation of goodwill include growth of revenue and margins and increased cash flows over time 
if actual operating results were to differ from these assumptions  it may result in an impairment of our goodwill 
the greenbrier companies annual report 
table of contents the provisions of accounting standards codification asc  intangibles goodwill and other  require that we perform a two step impairment test on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on a weighting of income and market approaches 
under the income approach  we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
under the market approach  we estimate the fair value based on observed market multiples for comparable businesses 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test is required only in situations where the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value as determined in the first step 
in the second step we would compare the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill 
the goodwill balance as of august  of million relates to the wheel services  refurbishment parts segment 
goodwill was tested during the third quarter and the company concluded that goodwill was not impaired

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk we have operations in mexico and poland that conduct business in their local currencies as well as other regional currencies 
to mitigate the exposure to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of each entity  we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to protect the margin on a portion of forecast foreign currency sales 
at august   million of forecast sales in europe were hedged by foreign exchange contracts 
because of the variety of currencies in which purchases and sales are transacted and the interaction between currency rates  it is not possible to predict the impact a movement in a single foreign currency exchange rate would have on future operating results 
in addition to exposure to transaction gains or losses  we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to the net asset position of our foreign subsidiaries 
at august   net assets of foreign subsidiaries aggregated million and a strengthening of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies would result in a decrease in equity of million  or of total equity greenbrier 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
interest rate risk we have managed a portion of our variable rate debt with interest rate swap agreements  effectively converting million of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
as a result  we are exposed to interest rate risk relating to our revolving debt and a portion of term debt  which are at variable rates 
at august   of our outstanding debt has fixed rates and has variable rates 
at august   a uniform increase in interest rates would result in approximately million of additional annual interest expense
