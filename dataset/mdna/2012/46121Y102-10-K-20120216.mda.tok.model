overview our company we are the largest producer of muriate of potash potassium chloride or potash in the united states and are dedicated to the production and marketing of potash and langbeinite sulfate of potash magnesia  another mineral containing potassium that is produced from langbeinite ore and which we will generally describe as langbeinite when we refer to production and as trio when we refer to sales and marketing 
our revenues are generated exclusively from the sale of potash and trio 
potassium is one of the three primary nutrients essential to plant formation and growth 
we are one of two producers of sulfate of potash magnesia  a low chloride potassium fertilizer with the additional benefits of sulfate and magnesium  providing a multi nutrient product 
we also produce salt  magnesium chloride  and metal recovery salts from our potash mining processes  the sales of which are accounted for as by product credits to our cost of sales 
our potash is marketed for sale into three primary markets  agricultural market as fertilizer  industrial market as a component in drilling and fracturing fluids for oil and gas wells  and animal feed market as a nutrient 
our primary regional markets include agricultural areas and feed manufacturers in the central and western united states  as well as oil and gas drilling areas in the rocky mountains and the greater permian basin 
in addition to the agricultural regions noted above  we also have sales  primarily of trio  that go into the southeastern and eastern united states 
our potash production has a geographic concentration in the western united states and is therefore affected by weather and other conditions in this region 
we own five active potash production facilities three in new mexico referenced collectively below as carlsbad or individually as west  east  and north and two in utah moab and wendover and we have a current estimated productive capacity to produce approximately  tons of potash and approximately  tons of langbeinite annually 
actual production is affected by operating rates  recoveries  mining rates  evaporation rates  and the amount of development work that we do and  therefore  our production results tend to be lower than our productive capacity 
we are actively developing the hb solar solution mine  located adjacent to our existing producing assets near carlsbad  new mexico  which is an idled potash mine that we are in the process of permitting to reopen 
as a solution mine  it will utilize solar evaporation techniques in the production of potash 
we also have additional opportunities to develop mineralized deposits of potash in new mexico which could include the reopening of the north mine  which was operated as a traditional underground mine until the early s  as well as the acceleration of production from our reserves and mineralized deposits of potash through new access points in the area and the potential construction of additional production facilities in the region 
our profitability is directly linked to the sales price of our product  our sales volumes  our production rates  and the resulting production costs of our products 
production costs are impacted by production rates and  to a lesser extent  the price of variable costs such as natural gas and other commodities used in production 
our current operating strategy is to run our mining operations and plants at normal and full operating rates to reduce per unit production costs while also focusing on production flexibility and granulation capacity 
our sales strategy is to seek to maximize our margins by selling tonnage into markets where we have freight and logistic advantages based on the location of our facilities  while still selling selected amounts of product into more distant markets to maintain sales volumes 
market prices vary to some degree across the country and we attempt to manage our sales to take advantage of these pricing variations with consideration of freight differentials 
recent events and market trends our net income was million  or per share with cash flows from operations of million 
we had capital investments of million in and ended the year with million of cash and investments with no debt outstanding 
our production volumes of potash and trio increased to a combined  tons in from  in as we increased production towards full operating levels throughout our production volumes of potash increased to  tons in from  tons in  while trio production volumes decreased to  tons in 
table of contents from  tons in potash in  we sold  tons of potash as compared to  tons in during the first six months of  strong commodity markets provided an opportunity for improved farmer economics  which in turn increased demand for potash  resulting in higher potash prices 
however  our sales of potash in were impacted by poor weather conditions such as  persistent high water levels in certain customer locations along the missouri river and the continued drought conditions in texas and nearby states 
during the fourth quarter of  we saw what we believe is a short term decrease in farmer demand for fertilizer and believe farmer buying decisions were affected by macro factors including uncertainty around global economic stability  a focus on purchases of seed and equipment  and a desire to defer the purchase of certain fertilizer inputs until the spring of the improvement in potash pricing began in the fall of and accelerated through the second quarter of  as crop economics for us farmers remained solid 
most crop prices moved up significantly during the second half of and remained favorable in due to continued tight stock to use ratios and strong demand for grains worldwide 
revisions in crop yields by the united states department of agriculture usda have resulted in predictions of slightly increased world grain stocks from million metric tons to million metric tons for  however  this increase is still well below the levels of million metric tons 
while it appears corn crop yields in in the united states were lower than in as a result of challenging regional weather conditions  including those described above  current crop economics across a broad spectrum of agricultural commodities remain favorable to the farmer thereby incentivizing fertilizer demand 
in the last half of the fourth quarter of  we saw prices of other nutrients fall  which has historically suggested a decrease in potash prices 
however  the prices of nitrogen and phosphate rebounded early in and seem to have now stabilized 
we have observed mid west farmers actively applying nitrogen products well into january  which typically is a positive precursor to strong phosphate and potassium application 
we expect dealers will take a conservative approach in their crop nutrient purchases through the first half of and attempt to manage inventories by timing purchases so that they minimize working capital risk of holding inventory 
in order to be able to expand our marketing reach into the agricultural sector and build in flexibility to our production capacity  we are investing in additional granulation capacity  having completed new compaction facilities in wendover in and in moab in further  we are entering the permitting phase for the expansion of our granulation capacity at our north plant in carlsbad 
additional compaction capacity in carlsbad should further enhance our marketing flexibility 
industrial demand for our standard sized potash increased in over  as we sold percent more tons into the industrial market compared to a year ago 
this increase in sales volume has resulted from an increase in the rig count from december of approximately percent in the geographic regions primarily served by our facilities with the continued expansion of drilling and fracture stimulation work in profitable oil and liquids rich natural gas development activity 
we expect industrial demand for our standard sized product will correlate over the long term with oil and gas pricing  drilling  and well completion activities 
we believe that potash is the most effective clay swelling inhibitor available  and we are marketing potash as the drilling fluid additive of choice in our traditional industrial market 
the percentage of our sales in the agricultural and feed markets stayed relatively consistent from to  but we did see a slight increase in our industrial sales volumes of standard product 
with the increase in our granulation capacity  we now have the ability to market our products based on a relative margin comparison between standard and granular demand into the associated end markets 
our potash sales mix was approximately as follows for the indicated periods 
year ended december  agricultural industrial feed over the long term  we believe that domestic consumption of fertilizers will remain at historical averages as the replacement of potassium in the soils is critical to continued high yield agricultural production and the demands placed on soils for plant nutrition 
this view is supported by data generated by fertecon limited  a fertilizer industry consultant  showing that over the past years the domestic consumption for potash has averaged approximately million tons with annual volatility of approximately percent 
these results have occurred through historical periods of low and high agricultural commodity prices  variability in oil and gas drilling  negative farmer margins  and a variety of other macro 
table of contents economic factors 
trio the most significant activity related to our trio operations was the substantial completion of the dense media separation plant that occurred in december this new plant is designed to improve the recovery of our langbeinite to approximately percent 
the commissioning of the new plant will continue into  allowing the benefit of the increased productivity to be realized 
the market for our trio product continues to be strong and we have been able to effectively increase the price through the year and into early in mid  we placed an emphasis on restoring the recovery rate at the old trio production plant from the levels experienced late in and early during  production volumes and costs at our east surface facility continued to be challenged in part due to the tie in and commissioning activities of the new plant 
as we continue to actively upgrade and improve the east surface plant  including work associated with the langbeinite recovery improvement project  we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  operating inefficiencies from time to time  which may result in variations to production levels and increased cash costs of goods sold 
we will continue to focus on improving the reliability and productivity of our east mill 
in  we experienced decreased sales volumes of trio relative to  as we sold  tons of trio in compared to  tons of trio in this was principally a result of having fewer tons of granular trio available for sale 
demand for trio continues to exceed supply and we expect that granular sized trio sales demand will at least meet our production capabilities for the next few quarters 
average net realized sales price domestic pricing of our products is influenced principally by the pricing established by the canadian producers and other large world producers  as well as the interaction of global potash supply and demand  ocean  land and barge freight rates  and currency fluctuations 
any of these factors could have a positive or negative impact on the price of our products 
in the first quarter of  we experienced a seasonal increase in our just in time truck sales that allowed us to realize the increased net sales price earlier than on our rail shipments 
however  as the drought conditions continued in the geographic area around our new mexico facilities  we experienced a slowdown in the truck market  particularly into texas starting in the second quarter of we expect the truck market to remain relatively slow during  and as a result  we continue to accept sales orders from rail customers at regional market prices for the tons that might otherwise be shipped via truck to more local markets 
the higher relative freight costs associated with those rail orders reduces our average net realized sales price per ton compared to the price we receive on the just in time truck sales 
our average net realized sales price per ton historically has been approximately between and percent of our posted price driven by a variety of factors  including  but not limited to  the different competitive markets in which we sell our products  associated customer discounts  and the mix of standard sized and granular sized product sold into the market 
to some degree  international prices influence the prices at which we sell our products 
generally  we benefit from a weakening us dollar 
in addition  due to the fact that our sales and costs are denominated in us dollars  changes in the value of the us dollar against other currencies have less of an effect on us compared to our competitors 
the strengthening in price we experienced in  however  is believed to be much more directly linked to the supply and demand fundamentals of the grain markets and the associated profitability of farmers at today s commodity prices 
given the short term softness of the domestic potash market towards the end of and early  we expect that the average net realized sales price for potash will be lower in the early part of as compared to the fourth quarter of the table below demonstrates the progression of our average net realized sales price for potash and trio in and average net realized sales price for the three months ended potash trio per ton december  september  june  march  december  september  june  march  
table of contents selected operations data the following table presents selected operations data for the periods noted 
analysis of the details of this information is contained throughout this discussion 
we present this table as a summary of information relating to key indicators of financial condition and operating performance that we believe are important 
average net realized sales price is calculated by deducting freight costs from gross revenues and then by dividing this result by tons of product sold during the period 
costs associated with abnormal production that occurred in and are excluded from the following analysis

by product credits were million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 

table of contents operating highlights our average net realized sales price of potash increased to per ton in the year ended december   as compared to per ton in the year ended december  this was the result of increases in our potash sales price for red granular product from per ton at the beginning of  to per ton  effective july  we were able to realize the benefit from the price increases and we continue to focus on obtaining the best net realized sales prices by opportunistically layering in sales to new geographical locations where we can maximize our net realizable sales price 
overall  we experienced similar potash sales volumes at higher average net realized sales prices and lower per unit cash cost of goods sold in as compared to the solid potash sales in were supported by favorable farmer economics due to improved commodity markets 
in late  farmers reduced fertilizer purchasing activity  which we believe was and continues to be a reaction to global economic instability and volatility in fertilizer input pricing 
drought conditions in texas also impacted our traditional shipping patterns  however  we were successful in expanding our geographical reach and marketing these displaced potash volumes into other markets less affected by weather 
our average potash gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to percent in  as compared to percent in  and was largely attributable to the increased average net realized sales price 
in  our cash operating cost of goods sold  which we define as total cost of goods sold excluding depreciation  depletion  amortization and royalties  net of by product credits  for potash decreased to per ton 
this result compares to cash operating cost of goods sold  net of by product credits  for potash of per ton in the decrease in cash operating cost of goods sold between years was driven by several items 
we benefited from increased mining capacity from our west mine  thereby resulting in lower per unit costs from our largest production facility 
we also experienced higher production and a greater percentage of our sales from our wendover and moab facilities 
the greater percentage of our utah sales reduced total company cash operating cost of goods sold due to the lower operating costs at these locations 
our production volume of potash in was  tons  or  tons more than in our production was higher in primarily due to producing at full production levels in  whereas in  we were adding employees during the first half of the year following the market driven production reductions that occurred in in addition  we benefited from capital invested in and commissioned in through higher production from additional mining panels in carlsbad 
further  the new compactor at moab  which was placed into service in december  was fully operational during allowing us to convert standard sized potash to granular sized potash to meet market demand 
we do expect higher cash operating cost of goods sold per ton in the first half of for both potash and trio as our inventory carrying values increased at our east mine as a result of maintenance activities and downtime from the tie in and new plant commissioning 
as we sell through our east facility inventory  those higher cost tons of potash will be reflected as cost of goods sold in we evaluate the longer term trends affecting per ton operating costs with these quarterly and periodic variances in mind 
we increased our average net realized sales price of trio from per ton in to per ton in the increase in trio pricing was the result of strengthening demand  including in the export market for standard sized product  and overall increases in potash prices 
the demand increase includes an improvement in pricing in the export markets for standard sized trio 
during  our posted price for granular sized trio increased from per ton in january to per ton effective november  we have subsequently increased the posted price of granular sized trio to per ton in january we were able to realize the benefit of increased prices for our granular sized trio product almost immediately because of our tight inventory position and strong demand 
the decrease in trio sales volumes in compared to was due to lower than anticipated production results 
our cash operating cost of goods sold for trio increased per ton in compared to specific factors affecting our results sales our gross sales are derived from the sales of potash and trio and are determined by the quantities of product we sell and the sales prices we realize 
we quote prices to customers both on a delivered basis and on the basis of pick up at our plants and warehouses 
freight costs are incurred on only a portion of our sales as many of our customers arrange and pay for their own freight directly 
when we arrange and pay for freight  our quotes and billings are based on expected freight costs to the points of delivery 
our gross sales include the freight that we bill  but we do not believe that gross sales provide a representative measurement of our performance in the market due to variations caused by ongoing changes in the proportion of customers paying for their own freight  the geographic distribution of our products  and freight rates 
we view net sales  which are gross sales less freight costs  as the key performance indicator of our revenue as it conveys the sales price of the 
table of contents product that we realize 
we manage our sales and marketing operations centrally and we work to achieve the highest average net realized sales price we can by evaluating the product needs of our customers and then determining which of our production facilities can be utilized to fill these needs by considering which facility can produce and deliver the required product to the customer 
the volume of product we sell is determined by demand for our products and by our production capabilities 
we manage our production levels  as needed  in response to market demand with a view toward steady and reliable production levels to obtain the benefit of full production and being mindful of inventory levels in the near term  while ensuring that our balance sheet remains strong 
our facilities operate more efficiently with steady to increasing operating rates rather than constantly adjusting rates 
by having adequate warehouse capacity  we can maintain production levels during periods of fluctuating product demand 
at the current time  we are working to produce at maximum rates relative to staffing levels  plant capacities  and regularly scheduled maintenance 
cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold reflects the costs to produce our potash and trio products  less credits generated from the sale of our by products 
many of our production costs are largely fixed and  consequently  our costs of sales per ton on a facility by facility basis tend to move inversely with the number of tons we produce  within the context of normal production levels 
our principal production costs include labor and employee benefits  maintenance materials  contract labor and materials for operating or maintenance projects  natural gas  electricity  operating supplies  chemicals  depreciation and depletion  royalties  and leasing costs 
there are elements of our cost structure associated with contract labor  consumable operating supplies  and reagents and royalties that are variable  which make up a smaller component of our cost base 
our periodic production costs and costs of goods sold will not necessarily match one another from period to period based on the fluctuation of inventory and production levels 
from a total dollar perspective  we have seen an increase in our overall production costs as we have mined and produced more tons in than in as discussed above  the production volumes from our mines were at higher levels in as compared to  resulting in a favorable overall per unit cost profile 
the total dollar increase in production costs was driven principally by the increased volumes in  as compared to increased production volumes required higher labor costs  operating supplies and reagent costs 
as we made significant capital investments during and  we also recorded an increase is depreciation in as compared to our production costs per ton are also impacted when our production levels change  due to factors such as changes in mine development and downtime for annual maintenance turnarounds  or voluntary shutdowns to manage inventory levels 
our labor and contract labor costs in carlsbad may continue to be influenced by the demand for labor in the local potash  oil and gas  and nuclear waste storage industries 
we incurred normal scheduled maintenance turnarounds at our west plant in june of and at our east plant in september of additionally  the east mine contains a mixed ore body comprised of potash and langbeinite 
the mix of ore will influence the amount of product tons of potash and langbeinite ultimately produced from the facility  impact our production costs per ton for each product and affect our quarter to quarter results 
our cash operating cost of goods sold per ton of potash  was per ton in  net of per ton of by product credits  compared to per ton in  net of per ton of by product credits 
our lower per unit cash operating cost of goods sold per ton during resulted primarily from higher production rates in from the west mine and increased production of relatively lower cost finished product from our utah operations that was sold in we pay royalties to federal  state  and private lessors under our mineral leases  and such payments are typically a percentage of net sales of minerals extracted and sold under the applicable lease 
in some cases  federal royalties for potash are paid on a sliding scale basis that varies with the grade of ore extracted 
for the years ended december    and  our average royalty rate was percent  percent and percent  respectively 
we expect that future average royalty rates will increase as certain new mexico mineral leases are currently being renewed at a fixed royalty rate of five percent 
cost associated with abnormal production we periodically evaluate our production levels and costs to determine if any such items should be deemed abnormal under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap with respect to inventory costing 
there was no such adjustment made in  as we believe we were producing within our normal ranges of production 
in  we determined that approximately million of production costs would have been allocated to additional tons produced  assuming we had been operating at normal production rates 
when such adjustments are recorded  the result is an acceleration of the recognition of this expense and the exclusion of these costs from the accumulated inventory costs and the resulting cost of goods sold elements 
the assessment of normal production levels requires significant management estimates and is unique to each quarter 

table of contents income taxes we are a subchapter c corporation and  therefore  are subject to federal and state income taxes on our taxable income 
for the years ended december    and  our effective income tax rate was percent  percent and percent  respectively 
our effective income tax rates are impacted primarily by changes in the underlying tax rates in jurisdictions in which we are subject to income tax and permanent differences between book and tax income for the period  including the benefit associated with the estimated effect of the domestic production activities deduction 
our federal and state income tax returns are subject to examination by federal and state tax authorities 
as described more fully below  the decrease in effective tax rate in was primarily a function of adjusting the tax rate applied to our deferred tax asset to reflect the anticipated blended state income tax rates for the company 
the tax basis of the assets and liabilities transferred to us pursuant to the exchange agreement at the time of the ipo was  in the aggregate  equal to mining s adjusted tax basis in the assets as of the date of the exchange  increased by the amount of taxable gain recognized by mining in connection with the transactions occurring at the time of the ipo 
therefore  the net tax basis in the assets and liabilities transferred to us is significantly higher than the book basis in the same assets and liabilities 
the basis difference between book and tax generated a net deferred tax asset for us at the time of the transaction 
the net deferred tax asset recorded as of the date of exchange was approximately million  with a corresponding increase to additional paid in capital 
the majority of our deferred tax asset was assigned to mineral properties  and the anticipated use of percentage depletion to reduce our taxable income  relative to book income  is expected to provide full realization of this asset over time 
as of december   the net deferred tax asset has been reduced to approximately million  primarily through utilization of percentage depletion and placing bonus depreciation approved assets into service in and we have evaluated our deferred tax assets to determine if the need for a valuation allowance exists  and we have concluded that no material valuation allowances are necessary 
we base this conclusion on the expectation that future taxable income should allow us to fully realize these deferred tax assets 
on september   the small business jobs act of was enacted and  on december   the tax relief  unemployment insurance reauthorization  and jobs creation act of became law 
each of these laws provides for additional tax depreciation ie bonus depreciation for qualifying property in the year the asset is placed in service 
the combination of these laws provides for percent bonus depreciation on qualifying assets placed in service after december   through september   percent bonus depreciation on qualifying assets placed in service after september   through december   and percent bonus depreciation on qualifying assets placed in service after december   through december  the impact of these changes in tax depreciation contributes significantly to a resulting current and deferred tax expense benefit 
for the year ended december   the total tax expense was million 
total tax expense for the year ended december   was comprised of million of current income tax expense and million of deferred income tax expense 
for the year ended december   the total tax expense was million 
for  total tax expense was comprised of million of current income tax benefit and million of deferred income tax expense 
our current tax expense for these periods is less than our total tax expense in large part due to the impacts of accelerated tax bonus depreciation and the utilization of percentage depletion 
we are required to evaluate our deferred tax assets and liabilities each reporting period using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized 
the estimated statutory income tax rates that are applied to our current and deferred income tax calculations are impacted most significantly by the states in which we do business 
changing business conditions for normal business transactions and operations  as well as changes to state tax rate and apportionment laws  potentially alter our apportionment of income among the states for income tax purposes 
these changes in apportionment laws result in changes in the calculation of our current and deferred income taxes  including the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the effects of any such changes are recorded in the period of the adjustment 
such adjustments can increase or decrease the net deferred tax asset on the balance sheet and impact the corresponding deferred tax benefit or deferred tax expense on the income statement 
a decrease of our blended state tax rate decreases the value of our deferred tax asset  resulting in additional deferred tax expense being recorded in the income statement 
conversely  an increase in our blended state income tax rate would increase the value of the deferred tax asset  resulting in an increase in our deferred tax benefit 
because of the magnitude of the temporary differences between book and tax bases in our assets  relatively small changes in the blended state tax rate may have a pronounced impact on the value of the net deferred tax asset 
as of december   our estimate of our blended state tax rate increased  resulting in an increase of the value of the net deferred tax asset by million to reflect changes in 
table of contents business conditions together with changes in allocation and apportionment rules of the states in which we operate 
the increase in the value of the deferred tax asset generated a reduction in the deferred tax expense for the year ended december  of million 
outlook for we believe that farmers have the economic resources and motivation to replace the nutrients drawn from the soil and  in some cases  to increase the nutrient levels in the soil in order to achieve better yields for their crops 
corn and oilseed prices remain favorable to farmers and provide them with an opportunity to obtain a significant margin 
importantly  the overall commodity prices for not only corn and oilseeds  but for all grains  sugar  and cotton remain strong 
consequently  we are anticipating a solid spring shipping season based on historical demand data  current estimates for a larger corn acreage in compared to and strong economic incentives for farmers to maximize yield on all commodities 
we also evaluate world stock to use ratios and expect continued tight grain stocks for an extended period of time assuming a continuation of the current macro trends 
the stronger potash market that emerged in allowed producers to bring back production capacity that was idled in and and this continued through in early  certain of our competitors announced plans to temporarily curtail production at a portion of their facilities to better align their potash inventories with market demand 
as we believe we have adequate inventory storage capacity  and believe our facilities operate more efficiently at steady rates of production  we plan to operate at full production levels during for the next full year  we expect demand to be in line with historical norms albeit with more concentration of sales activity in the spring and fall periods for agriculture 
we believe the timing  and ultimately the size  of the spring application window will be a key determinant of spring demand 
we believe that our strong balance sheet will enable us to execute on our strategic capital investment projects which are designed to increase production and lower per unit costs  and that the strong market for potash will permit us to execute our marketing strategy to maximize margin 
potash prices potash prices have been and will continue to be the most significant driver of profitability for our business 
our average net realized sales price in was per ton 
our average net realized sales price increased throughout the year in response to strong demand and favorable commodity prices for corn and other crops 
we announced several price increases for red granular sized potash during the second quarter of  with our last published price quoted at per ton effective july  potash demand softened during the latter half of the fourth quarter of due to a number of factors 
although we have experienced softness in the market in early  we are starting to see increased activity in the market as we approach the spring application season 
we believe farmers will ultimately purchase and apply fertilizers at historically normal levels to maximize yield and their profit potential 
the timing of orders and shipments is unpredictable and may result in more sales in the second quarter of than the first quarter 
given the softening of demand late in  which put downward pressure on potash prices  we anticipate sales in the first part of will result in average net realized sales prices below the per ton realized in the fourth quarter other factors that may influence pricing for include international fertilizer demand  our competitors level of production  net of curtailments  the amount of domestic demand already satisfied  and whether current crop prices and other crop nutrients can be sustained 
we continue to have strong demand in excess of our productive capacity for all sizes of our trio product 
we expect to be able to sell all of our incremental trio production at higher average net realized sales prices compared to trio domestic prices tend to move in a relatively close relationship to potash  with consideration of the value of magnesium and sulfate 
export pricing continues to show strength as international customers see value relative to alternative products 
capital investment we believe that  in the long term  demand for potash will remain at  or exceed  historical levels  therefore  we have developed an investment plan at each of our facilities to supply this demand 
the focus of the capital investment program is to maintain safe and reliable production  ensure environmental and regulatory compliance  improve and modernize equipment  increase reliability of the facilities  and increase productivity and recoveries 
the expected result of these investments is to grow production capacity and decrease per ton production costs while also increasing the flexibility of our production mix to support our marketing efforts 
we plan to continue executing and accelerating  when appropriate  our capital strategy 
our strategy to increase granulation capacity is being undertaken for both potash and trio 
we successfully completed the construction of a new compactor at wendover in and in moab during in october  our board of directors approved plans for additional compaction capacity at our north facility  and we are now in the permitting phase of that project 
our langbeinite recovery improvement project includes a granulation plant that is designed with the capacity to granulate all of our standard sized trio into a premium granular product 
construction of the granulation plant associated with the langbeinite recovery improvement project continues to progress  and we expect to complete 
table of contents commissioning in the first half of as we invest in our facilities  we seek to deploy capital while maintaining sufficient cash on the balance sheet to react strategically to market conditions 
in  we invested approximately million in capital projects 
as mentioned previously  we have made a significant investment in our plant assets to produce more langbeinite though our langbeinite recovery improvement project 
this new plant is designed to increase our recoveries of trio from the langbeinite ore using dense media processing and to enable us to granulate all of our standard sized product  should market conditions warrant 
in addition  this project is designed to reduce our water usage and thereby reduce investment in additional capital in water management facilities and storage capacity at our east mine 
the overall project is designed to increase our recoveries of langbeinite from the historical design recovery rates of approximately to percent to approximately percent 
construction of the dense media separation plant was substantially complete in december and commissioning continues to progress 
as previously discussed  we continue to prepare for construction of the hb solar solution mine 
the total expected investment for the project is between and million 
as of december   we have invested million to date in engineering  design  permitting and equipment for this project 
upon receipt of all of the necessary regulatory permits and approvals  construction will begin promptly  and first production is expected to begin approximately months later  with ramp up production expected in the following year  and production levels increasing into the third year of operations  assuming the benefit of an average annual evaporation cycle applied to full evaporation ponds 
looking forward  total capital investment in is estimated to be between and million  including the completion of construction of the granulation plant on the langbeinite recovery improvement project  and the anticipated start of construction for both the hb solar solution mine and the expansion of our north compaction facility 
we also are planning to drill new wells in moab to expand the underground horizontal cavern system 
the actual level of capital investment for the year will be impacted ultimately by the timing of permitting  deliveries of equipment and construction 
a breakdown of our capital investment plan includes approximately to million to replace assets needed to maintain production and complete regulatory compliance projects and to million to increase productive and granulation capacity 
we expect our operating capital programs to be funded out of cash flow and existing cash and investments 
in addition to the hb project described above  the following are more details of a few of the other significant projects that are scheduled for investment in to improve the overall reliability of the operations and to increase productive and compaction capacity the total capital investment for the langbeinite recovery improvement project is expected to be between and million  of which approximately million has been invested to date  with the balance expected to be invested early in construction for the dense media separation plant was substantially completed during the fourth quarter of and the construction and commissioning of the granulation plant are expected to be completed in the first half of the north compaction project is expected to be completed to coincide with the production increases from the hb solar solution mine and the expansion of mining and milling capacity at the west mine  with completion of the first portion of the plant planned for early and future plans for expansion as required by production 
we initiated the permitting process for this project in the fourth quarter of assuming the necessary permits are obtained on a timely basis  we will begin construction in the second quarter of total capital investment for the project is expected to be approximately to million  of which approximately million has been invested to date 
we are developing additional solution mining opportunities at our moab facility 
we are expanding the horizontal cavern system with the drilling of additional horizontal wells 
this represents a capital investment of approximately to million 
the new wells are intended to stabilize existing production levels as well as provide modest production increases 
all dollar amounts and timing of future capital investments are estimates that are subject to change as projects are further developed  modified  deferred  or canceled 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  and investments of million  we had no debt  and we had million available under our unsecured credit facility 
the million was made up of million in cash  
table of contents million in cash equivalent investments  consisting of money market accounts or certificates of deposit with banking institutions that we believe are financially sound  million and million invested in short and long term investments  respectively  comprised of certificates of deposit investments of million and corporate debt securities of million 
there were no losses on our cash  cash equivalents and investments during our operations are primarily funded from cash on hand and cash generated by operations  and  if necessary  we have the ability to borrow under our senior credit facility 
for the foreseeable future  we believe that our cash  cash equivalents  and investment balances  cash flow from operations  and available borrowings under our senior credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations  our working capital requirements  and our presently planned capital investments 
year ended december  in thousands cash flows from operating activities cash flows from investing activities cash flows from financing activities operating activities total cash provided by operating activities increased by million in compared to primarily due to higher net income  driven by higher average net realized sales prices for both potash and trio 
the increase in cash was offset by an increase in inventory as product sales largely matched production levels  compared to  in which our product sales were in excess of production levels 
additionally  we experienced an increase in other accounts receivable as of december   compared to december   due to the recording of a refundable employment related credit in the state of new mexico  of which million was recorded as a receivable as of december  total cash provided by operating activities increased by million in as compared to primarily due to the sales of product early in the year in excess of our production rates which decreased product inventory balances into the spring of for the remainder of  our sales largely matched production levels 
we experienced more robust overall sales in as compared to  which was a significant contributor to the higher operating cash flows 
these changes were offset by lower net income when comparing to the lower net income and decreased product inventory were reflective of the business conditions in our industry  as producers were selling more product in than in  although at lower prices 
for  product inventories decreased million compared to an increase of million in  due to increased demand for our products reflected in sales tons after the declines in application rates for much of spare part inventory increased million for the year ended december   compared to an increase of million in  as we installed new equipment into our operating facilities 
investing activities total cash used in investing activities increased in compared to due to an increase in the amount of the amount of cash invested in property  plant  and equipment as well as mineral properties and development costs to million in from million in in  we continued to invest excess cash in higher yielding corporate and government agency securities by purchasing million of investments and receiving million in proceeds from maturing investments 
the maturity of these investments is expected to generally match the cash needs for our capital investments 
total cash used in investing activities increased in compared to due to an increase in the amount of excess cash we invested in higher yielding corporate and government agency securities by purchasing million of investments and receiving million in proceeds from maturing investments 
this is offset by a decrease in the amount of cash invested in property  plant  and equipment 
in addition  mineral properties and development costs was million in compared to million in financing activities in  we paid million for employees minimum statutory tax withholdings upon the vesting of certain restricted stock awards for employees who elected to net share settle their awards 
we also paid million in debt issuances costs related to our new unsecured credit facility 

table of contents for the year ended december   we paid million for employees minimum statutory tax withholdings upon the vesting of certain restricted stock awards for employees who elected to net share settle their awards 
unsecured credit facility in august  we entered into a new unsecured credit facility  led by us bank  as administrative agent  and wells fargo bank  as syndication agent 
this new unsecured credit facility  which replaced our previous credit facility in its entirety  provides a total facility of million 
the facility is guaranteed by certain of our material subsidiaries as defined in the agreement and includes financial covenants requiring a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio 
the facility has a five year term through august the entire amount of the facility was available for use as of december  outstanding balances under the new unsecured senior credit facility bear interest at a floating rate  which  at our option  is either the london interbank offered rate libor  plus a margin of between percent and percent  depending upon our leverage ratio  which is equal to the ratio of our total funded indebtedness to our adjusted earnings for the prior four fiscal quarters before interest  income taxes  depreciation  amortization and certain other expenses  or an alternative base rate  plus a margin of between percent and percent  depending upon our leverage ratio 
we pay a quarterly commitment fee on the outstanding portion of the unused revolving credit facility amount of between percent and percent  depending on our leverage ratio 
our previous senior credit facility required us to maintain interest rate derivative agreements to fix the interest rate for at least percent of the projected outstanding balance of our term loan  when we had debt outstanding 
historically  we maintained derivative hedging agreements that were swaps of variable rate interest for fixed rate payments 
despite repaying the amounts outstanding under the senior credit facility at the time of the ipo  we left the interest rate swap agreements in place taking the view that interest rates would rise and that the cost of settling the derivatives would be relatively beneficial as compared to closing out the contracts at that time 
interest rates  however  decreased following the ipo  and the liability that we have under these derivative agreements has increased since the date of the ipo 
given the current interest rate environment  we anticipate allowing these instruments to mature based on their original scheduled settlement dates 
we review our derivative positions from the perspective of counterparty risk when we are in an asset position and believe that we continue to transact with strong  creditworthy institutions 
notional amounts for which the rate has been fixed as of december   are displayed below 
termination date notional amount weighted average fixed rate in thousands december  the weighted average notional amount outstanding for these derivatives as of december   and the weighted average month libor rate locked in via these derivatives are million and percent 
the interest rate paid under our senior credit facility on any debt varies both with the change in the month libor rate and with our leverage ratio 
contractual obligations as of december   we had contractual obligations totaling million on an undiscounted basis  as indicated below 
contractual commitments shown are for the full calendar year indicated unless otherwise indicated 
payments due by period total more than years in thousands operating lease obligations purchase commitments natural gas purchase commitments pension obligations asset retirement obligation minimum royalty payments total 
table of contents includes all operating lease payments  inclusive of sales tax  for leases for office space  an airplane  railcars and other equipment 
purchase contractual commitments include the approximate amount due vendors for non cancelable purchase commitments for materials and services 
we have committed to purchase a minimum quantity of natural gas  which is priced at floating index dependent rates plus  estimated based on forward rates 
amounts are based on spot rates inclusive of estimated transportation costs and sales tax 
as we anticipate terminating our obligations under the pension plan  our remaining liability is estimated to be funded in our actual contributions requirements are contingent upon the timing of the pension plan termination  as well as participant settlement obligations 
we expect to record an additional expense on termination of the pension plan at the date we are released from the liability in an amount equal to the difference between the final amount funded  the recorded pension liability and the unrecognized actuarial loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
we are obligated to reclaim and remediate lands which our operations have disturbed  but  because of the long term nature of our reserves and facilities  we estimate that none of those expenditures will be required until after commitments shown are in today s dollars and are undiscounted 
estimated annual minimum royalties due under mineral leases  assuming approximately a year life  consistent with estimated useful lives of plant assets 
payments related to derivative contracts cannot be reasonably estimated due to variable market conditions and are not included in the above tables 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements aside from the operating leases described above under contractual obligations and bonding obligations described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
results of operations for the years ended december   and net sales and freight costs net sales of potash increased million  or percent  from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  this change was primarily the result of an increase in the average net realized sales price of per ton  or percent  slightly offset by a decrease in sales volume of two percent 
during the first six months of  strong commodity markets provided an opportunity for improved farmer economics  which in turn increased demand for potash  resulting in higher potash prices 
during the second half of  we continued to realize the benefits of our price increases until late in the fourth quarter when potash demand weakened  creating a softness in potash pricing 
our production volume of potash in was  tons  or  tons more than in our production was higher in primarily due to producing at full production levels in  whereas in  we were adding employees during the first half of the year following the market driven production reductions that started in in addition  the benefit of capital invested in and commissioned in was evident as higher production was available from additional mining panels in carlsbad 
each of these factors had a favorable influence on our per unit cash operating cost of goods sold in as compared to further  the new compactor at moab  which was placed into service in december  was fully operational during allowing us to convert standard sized potash to granular sized potash to meet market demand 
we do expect higher cash operating cost of goods sold per ton in early as our inventory carrying values increased at our east mine due to maintenance activities and downtime required to tie in new plant and equipment related to our langbeinite recovery improvement project in the fourth quarter 
as a result  our per ton carrying value of inventory at the east mine at the end of was higher 
as we sell through our inventory  the higher cost tons of potash will be reflected as cost of goods sold in further  in  we expect to sell proportionally more product out of our higher cost east facility in carlsbad due to higher available inventories and improved production rates  which will tend to increase our cost of goods sold on a per ton basis due to the mix of product sold from our east facility 
net sales of trio increased million  or percent  from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december   due to a percent increase in the average net realized sales price offset by a percent decrease in the volume of sales as we produced fewer tons of trio available for sale in as noted 
table of contents above 
freight costs decreased million  or five percent  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   due primarily to a decrease in trio sales volumes 
the mix of customers paying for their own freight is highly variable and affects the freight costs incurred by us and our gross sales 
fluctuations in freight costs are not a key indicator of any business trends or our operating performance  as freight costs are largely borne by our customers  either as part of the cost of the product delivered or as arranged directly by the customer 
cost of goods sold the following table presents our cost of goods sold for potash and trio for the subject periods year ended december  change between periods change cost of goods sold in millions costs associated with abnormal production in millions cost per ton of potash sold cost per ton of trio sold depreciation  depletion  and amortizations expense for potash was million and million in and  respectively  which equates to and on a per ton basis 
depreciation  depletion  and amortizations expense for trio was million and million in and  respectively  which equates to and on a per ton basis 
total cost of goods sold of potash  which includes royalties and depreciation  depletion and amortization  was per ton for both the years ended december  and these per ton results are exclusive of approximately million of production costs for potash that were not absorbed into inventory in  due to the determination that our production rates were abnormally low in the first quarter of although the total costs of goods sold was essentially flat between and  our per ton cash operating cost of goods sold decreased due to higher production rates as fixed production costs are spread over more tons produced 
this was offset by an increase in depreciation per ton due to an increase in capital projects completed late in and in total cost of goods sold of trio increased per ton  or percent  from per ton for the year ended december   to per ton for the year ended december  this increase in cost of goods sold on a per ton basis is due to lower production volumes in over which production costs are allocated 
as a result  our per ton production costs increased over those in as we have relatively low volumes of trio inventory as of december   those higher per ton production costs came through as cost of goods sold in in total  our cost of goods sold increased million  or percent  from million in the year ended december   to million in the year ended december  prior to absorption of costs into inventory  spending increased primarily to support higher production 
costs that changed materially during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   included increases in labor  operating supplies  depreciation and royalties  partially offset by decreases in natural gas and operating leases expenses  as we exercised early lease buy out provisions on certain operating leases 
on a comparative basis and within our production costs  labor and contract labor costs increased million  or percent  in due to the ramp up of the carlsbad operations from the downturn in operating supplies increased million  or percent  in due principally to increased usage related to returning to full production by in addition to price increases on major mine operating supplies 
depreciation  depletion  and amortization increased million  or percent  in the year ended december   as a result of the significant capital investment during and we expect depreciation expense to continue to increase on both an actual dollar basis and on a per ton basis as we continue to invest capital into our operations 
we manage capital investments on a basis of evaluating maintenance capital that we believe is necessary to maintain the productivity of our mines and investment capital that is designed to generate a return on invested capital 
royalty expense increased million  or percent  from which relates to the increase in net sales 
other changes in cost of goods sold followed from increased benefits and employment taxes  usage of chemicals and reagents  and 
table of contents property taxes  partially offset by decreased rental costs 
selling and administrative expense selling and administrative expenses increased million in  as compared to the change represents a nine percent increase from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to the short term incentive compensation expense  as the performance metrics were achieved at higher percentages than in in addition  our increases in headcount over resulted in slightly higher stock compensation expenses and travel expenses to our mines 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in professional services relative to the prior period 
recognition of income associated with deferred insurance proceeds in the first quarter of  we completed the reconstruction and commissioning of our product warehouses at our east facility and finalized insurance settlement amounts related to the associated product inventory warehouse insurance claim that resulted from a wind event that occurred in as a result  the million of deferred insurance proceeds that were recorded as of december   plus approximately million of additional insurance proceeds  were recognized as income in the three months ended march  the total of approximately million has been recorded as insurance settlements income expense from property and business losses on the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  there was no cash impact associated with this event in the year ended december   as the previously deferred insurance proceeds were paid to us prior to december   with the exception of the final insurance payment of approximately million  which was paid to us in april other operating income expense in june  we received notice that our application for a refundable employment related credit  related to qualifying wages earned for the years to january  of approximately million was approved by the state of new mexico 
accordingly  during the second quarter of  we recorded million of income  which is reflected in other operating income loss for the year ended december   this amount was collected in october the receipt of the approval notice from the state of new mexico confirms the process by which such credits are claimed with sufficient certainty 
beginning in the third quarter of  the value of additional estimated credits have been recorded in the same period in which the credit was earned as a reduction to our production costs  and is reflected in the associated cost of goods sold and in the remaining inventory cost base as of december  intrepid recorded an additional receivable of million related to the refundable employment related credit for qualifying wages paid in the state of new mexico for the period february through december  of which million  has been recorded as other operating income loss for credits earned for the periods prior to the third quarter of  as the associated inventory for this portion of the credit was sold in prior periods 
no such amounts were recorded during results of operations for the years ended december   and net sales and freight costs net sales of potash increased million  or percent  from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  in  we saw a decrease in demand for potash and we decreased our production rates in response 
this resulted in higher per ton inventory costs at the end of during and into early  potash prices decreased 
this price decline coupled with strong agricultural demand led to higher sales volumes in our average net realized sales price decreased per ton  or percent  from to net sales of trio decreased million  or percent  from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december   due to a percent decrease in the average net realized sales price offset by a percent increase in the volume of sales driven largely by granular sized demand 
freight costs increased million  or percent  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   due primarily to the significant increase in sales volume as well as increased movement of inventory to distribution warehouses 
the mix of customers paying for their own freight is highly variable and affects the freight costs incurred by intrepid and our gross sales 
fluctuations in freight costs are not a key indicator of any business trends or our operating performance  as freight costs are largely borne by our customers  either as part of the cost of the product delivered or as arranged directly by the customer 
cost of goods sold the following table presents our cost of goods sold for potash and trio for the subject periods 
table of contents year ended december  change between periods change cost of goods sold in millions costs associated with abnormal production in millions cost per ton of potash sold cost per ton of trio sold depreciation  depletion  and amortizations expense for potash was million and million in and  respectively  which equates to and per ton 
depreciation  depletion  and amortizations expense for trio was million and million in and  respectively  which equates to and per ton 
total cost of goods sold per ton  which includes royalties and depreciation  depletion and amortization  of potash decreased per ton  or percent  from per ton for the year ended december   to per ton for the year ended december  these per ton results are exclusive of approximately million and million of production costs for potash that were not absorbed into inventory in and  respectively  due to the determination that our production rates were abnormally low for these periods 
the per ton improvement reflects the fact that the higher operating rates of our facilities result in lower per ton costs as the fixed costs structure of the operations is spread over more produced tons 
the cost of goods sold numbers reflect only those costs that have been first absorbed into inventory and then subsequently recognized as the product tons are sold 
higher production rates in were the primary reason that cost of goods sold per ton declined relative to the comparable period in total cost of goods sold of our trio decreased per ton  or percent  from per ton for the year ended december   to per ton for the year ended december  these per ton results are exclusive of approximately million of production costs for trio that were not absorbed into inventory in a lower percentage of shared costs at our east mine were allocated to langbeinite in compared to the same period in the prior year because the ratio of potash to trio production increased  which contributed to the lower per ton costs as more costs were attributed to potash 
cost of goods sold increased million  or percent  from million in the year ended december   to million in the year ended december  the increase in the total expense was driven primarily by the higher volumes of potash and trio sold and an increase in production costs primarily to support higher production and sales volumes  prior to absorption of costs into inventory 
production cost elements that changed materially during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   included increases in labor  depreciation and natural gas costs 
labor and contract labor costs increased million  or percent  in due to increased labor following managed cut backs in operating rates and maintenance projects during depreciation increased million  or percent  in the year ended december   as a result of the capital investment in late and in natural gas costs increased million  or percent  in the year ended december   due principally to higher market rates for this commodity 
higher market rates drove million of the increase  and higher natural gas consumption at our east facility drove million of the increase 
other changes in cost of goods sold followed from increased royalties  chemicals  operating supplies  rental costs  and benefits and employment taxes  as well as a reduction in by product credits  partially offset by decreased insurance and maintenance spending  all as a result of higher operating rates than in selling and administrative expense selling and administrative expenses increased million in as compared to the same period in the change represents a three percent increase from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  the increase largely related to higher stock compensation expense due to an increase in the number of stock options and restricted common stock granted during the year  as well as an increase in bonuses  salaries and benefits in  partially offset by a reduction in professional services relative to the prior period 
income taxes income taxes decreased by million in as compared to the same period in income taxes of million were recognized in the year ended december   at an effective tax rate of percent 
income taxes of million were recognized in the year ended december   at an effective tax rate of percent 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements 
actual results could differ from such estimates and assumptions  and any such differences could result in material changes to our financial statements 
the following discussion presents information about our most critical accounting policies and estimates 
our significant accounting policies are further described in note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when evidence of an arrangement exists  risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to customers  which is generally when title passes  the selling price is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
title passes at the designated shipping point for the majority of sales  but  in a few cases  title passes at the delivery destination 
the shipping point may be the plant  a distribution warehouse  a customer warehouse  or a port 
title passes for some international shipments upon payment by the purchaser  however  revenue is recognized for these transactions upon shipment because the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred pursuant to a contractual arrangement 
prices are generally set at the time of  or prior to  shipment 
in cases where the final price is determined upon resale of the product by the customer  revenue is deferred until the final sales price is known 
we quote prices to customers both on a delivered basis and on the basis of pick up at our plants and warehouses 
we incur and bill the customer and record as gross revenue the product sales value  freight  packaging  and certain other distribution costs only when we are responsible for such costs  however  many customers arrange for and pay for these costs directly and in these situations  only the product sales value is included in gross revenues 
application of this policy requires that we make estimates regarding creditworthiness of the customer  which impacts the timing of revenue recognition  and ultimately  the determination of allowance for doubtful accounts 
we make those estimates based on the most recent information available and historical experience  but they may be affected by subsequent changes in market conditions 
property  plant  and equipment property  plant  and equipment are stated at historical cost or at the allocated values determined upon acquisition of business entities 
expenditures for property  plant  and equipment relating to new assets or improvements are capitalized  provided the expenditure extends the useful life of an asset or extends the asset s functionality 
property  plant  and equipment are depreciated under the straight line method using estimated useful lives 
estimated useful lives range from to years 
useful lives are reviewed periodically and changed as necessary 
gains or losses from normal sales  disposals  or retirements of assets are included in other within operating income 
mineral properties and development costs mineral properties and development costs  which are referred to collectively as mineral properties  include acquisition costs  the cost of drilling wells  and the cost of other development work  all of which are capitalized 
depletion of mineral properties is calculated using the units of production method over the estimated life of the relevant ore body 
the lives of reserves used for accounting purposes are shorter than current reserve life determinations prepared by us  and reviewed and independently determined by mine consultants  due to uncertainties inherent in long term estimates 
reserve studies and mine plans are updated periodically  and the remaining net balance of the mineral properties is depleted over the updated estimated life  subject to a year limit 
possible impairment is also considered in conjunction with updated reserve studies and mine plans 
our proven and probable reserves are based on extensive drilling  sampling  mine modeling  and mineral recovery from which economic feasibility has been determined 
the price sensitivity of reserves depends upon several factors including ore grade  ore thickness  and ore mineral composition 
the reserves are estimated based on information available at the time the reserves are calculated 
recovery rates vary depending on the mineral properties of each deposit and the production process used 
the reserve estimate utilizes the average recovery rate for the deposit  which takes into account the processing methods scheduled to be used 
the cutoff grade  or lowest grade of mineralized material considered economic to process  varies with material type  mineral recoveries  operating costs  and expected selling price 
proven and probable reserves are based on estimates  and no assurance can be given that the indicated levels of recovery of potash and langbeinite will be realized or that production costs and estimated future development costs will not exceed the net realizable value of the products 
tons of potash and langbeinite in the proven and probable reserves are expressed in terms of expected finished tons of product to be realized  net of estimated losses 
reserve estimates may require revision based on actual production experience 
market price fluctuations of potash or trio  as well as increased production costs or reduced recovery rates  could render proven and probable reserves containing relatively lower grades of mineralization uneconomic to exploit and might result in a reduction of reserves 
in addition  the provisions of our mineral leases  including royalties payable  are subject to periodic readjustment by the state and federal government  which could affect the economics of our reserve estimates 
significant changes in the estimated reserves could 
table of contents have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
inventory inventory consists of product and by product stocks which are ready for sale  mined ore  potash in evaporation ponds  and parts and supplies inventory 
product and by product inventory cost is determined using the lower of weighted average cost or estimated net realizable value 
if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated net realizable value  we adjust our inventory balance accordingly 
if the actual sales price ultimately realized were to be less than our estimate of net realizable value  additional losses would be incurred in the period of liquidation 
cost includes direct costs  maintenance  operational overhead  depreciation  depletion  and equipment lease costs applicable to the production process 
direct costs  maintenance  and operational overhead include labor and associated benefits 
the value of potash within the solar ponds  which is considered work in process inventory  is estimated based on the amount of finished inventory expected to be recovered and the lower of cost incurred through the stage of completion or net realizable value less costs to complete the process 
significant estimates are used in the allocation of costs to different products  including by products 
we evaluate production levels and costs to determine if any should be deemed abnormal  and therefore excluded from inventory costs 
if our analysis concludes that production levels or costs during a certain period are deemed abnormal  the associated costs will be excluded from inventory and instead expensed during the applicable periods 
the assessment of normal production levels is judgmental and is unique to each period 
we model normal production levels and evaluate historical ranges of production by operating plant in assessing what is deemed to be normal 
we also conduct detailed reviews related to the net realizable value of parts inventory  giving consideration to quality  slow moving items  obsolescence  excessive levels  and other factors 
parts inventories not having turned over in more than a year  excluding parts classified as critical spares  are reviewed for obsolescence and included in the determination of an allowance for obsolescence 
recoverability of long lived assets we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amount may not be recoverable 
impairment is considered to exist if an asset s total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the related asset 
an impairment loss is measured and recorded based on the discounted estimated future cash flows 
changes in significant assumptions underlying future cash flow estimates or fair values of assets may have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
factors we generally will consider important and which could trigger an impairment review of the carrying value of long lived assets include the following significant underperformance relative to expected operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of assets or the strategy for our overall business  the denial or delay of necessary permits or approvals that would affect the utilization of our tangible assets  underutilization of our tangible assets  discontinuance of certain products by us or our customers  a decrease in estimated mineral reserves  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
although we believe the carrying values of our long lived assets were realizable as of the balance sheet dates  future events could cause us to conclude otherwise 
asset retirement obligation all of our mining properties involve certain reclamation liabilities as required by the states in which they operate or by the blm 
these asset retirement obligations are reviewed and updated at least annually with any changes in balances recorded as adjustments to the related assets and liabilities 
changes in estimates result from changes in estimated probabilities  amounts  refinements in scope  technological developments  and timing of the settlement of the asset retirement obligation  as well as changes in the legal requirements of an obligation 
the estimates of amounts to be spent are subject to considerable uncertainty and long timeframes 
changes in these estimates could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
scheduled maintenance each operation typically shuts down periodically for maintenance 
the new mexico operations have historically shut down for up to two weeks to perform turnaround maintenance 
generally  the moab and wendover operations cease harvesting potash from our solar ponds during one or more summer months to make the most of the evaporation season 
during these summer turnarounds  annual maintenance is performed 
the costs of maintenance turnarounds are considered part of production costs and are absorbed into inventory in the period incurred 

table of contents income taxes we are a subchapter c corporation and therefore are subject to us federal and state income taxes 
we recognize income taxes under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized 
we record a valuation allowance if it is deemed more likely than not that our deferred income tax assets will not be realized in full  such determinations are subject to ongoing assessment 
with respect to the accounting and disclosure requirements for income taxes  we follow the accounting guidance of topic  income taxes  of the financial accounting standards board s fasb accounting standards codification 
this guidance addresses the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return as well as disclosure requirements associated with such positions 
a current assessment of our tax positions has been made and  as a result  there has been no material effect on our results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation by recording expense using the fair value of the awards at the time of grant 
we have recorded compensation expense associated with the issuance of non vested restricted common stock awards with service conditions and non qualified stock option awards that are subject to a service period  and the expense associated with such awards is recognized over the associated service period 
there are no performance or market conditions associated with these awards 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our operations may be impacted by commodity prices  geographic concentration  changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
commodity prices potash and trio  our principal products  are commodities but are not traded on any commodity exchange 
as such  direct hedging of the prices for future production cannot be undertaken 
generally  we do not enter into long term sales contracts with customers  so prices vary with each particular transaction and the individual bids that we receive 
our potash is marketed for sale into three primary markets the agricultural market as a fertilizer  the industrial market as a component in drilling fluids for oil and gas exploration  and the animal feed market as a nutrient 
prices will vary based upon the demand from these different markets 
our net sales and profitability are determined principally by the price of potash and trio and  to a lesser extent  by the price of natural gas and other commodities used in the production of potash and langbeinite 
the price of potash and trio is influenced by agricultural demand and the prices of agricultural commodities 
decreases in agricultural demand or agricultural commodity prices could reduce our agricultural potash and trio sales 
if natural gas and oil prices were to decline enough to result in a reduction in drilling activity  our industrial potash sales would decline 
our costs and capital investments are subject to market movements in other commodities such as natural gas  electricity  steel  and chemicals 
we have entered into derivative transactions for the purchase of natural gas in the past 
as of december   we had no natural gas derivative contracts 
geographic concentration we primarily sell potash into the regions that include agricultural areas west of the mississippi river  oil and gas exploration areas in the rocky mountains and the permian basin  and animal feed production throughout the united states 
our potash mines and many of our customers are concentrated in the western half of united states and are  therefore  affected by weather and other conditions in this region 
interest rate fluctuations our former senior credit facility required us to fix a portion of our interest rate exposure through the use of derivatives when we have long term debt outstanding 
although we currently have no long term debt outstanding  we have left in place certain derivative contracts that were entered into at a time when we did have long term debt outstanding 
the weighted average notional amount outstanding as of december   and the weighted average month libor rate locked in via these derivatives through december were million and percent  respectively 
foreign currency exchange rates we typically have low balances of accounts receivable denominated in canadian dollars and  as a result  we have 
table of contents minimal direct foreign exchange risk 
there is an indirect foreign exchange risk as described below 
the united states imports the majority of its potash from canada and russia 
if the canadian dollar and the russian ruble strengthen in comparison to the us dollar  foreign suppliers realize a smaller margin as measured in their local currencies unless they increase their nominal us dollar prices 
strengthening of the canadian dollar and russian ruble therefore tend to support higher us potash prices as canadian and russian potash producers attempt to maintain their margins 
however  if the canadian dollar and russian ruble weaken in comparison to the us dollar  foreign competitors may choose to lower prices significantly to increase sales volumes while maintaining margins as measured in their local currencies 
a decrease in the average net realized sales price of our potash would adversely affect our operating results
