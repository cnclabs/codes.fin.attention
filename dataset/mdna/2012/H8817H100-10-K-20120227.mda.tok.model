item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and notes to consolidated financial statements note segments  geographical analysis and major customers 
recent developments in february  we sold the subsidiary that owns the high specification jackup  trident  located in the caspian sea 
in march  we engaged an unaffiliated advisor to coordinate the sale of the assets of our oil and gas properties reporting unit  a component of our other operations segment  which comprises the exploration  development and production activities performed by challenger minerals inc and challenger minerals north sea limited together  cmi 
as a result of these actions  we reclassified to discontinued operations the operating results and the assets and liabilities associated with our caspian sea operations and our oil and gas operations 
in october  we completed the sale of challenger minerals north sea limited  and in february  entered into an agreement to sell the assets of challenger minerals inc in october  we completed our acquisition of aker drilling asa aker drilling  a norwegian company formerly listed on the oslo stock exchange 
in connection with the acquisition  we acquired two harsh environment  ultra deepwater semisubmersibles currently operating on long term contracts in norway 
additionally  we acquired two ultra deepwater drillships currently under construction at the daewoo shipbuilding marine engineering co 
ltd 
shipyard in korea  which have expected deliveries in drilling fleet fleet overview most of our drilling equipment is suitable for both exploration and development drilling  and we normally engage in both types of drilling activity 
likewise  all of our drilling rigs are mobile and can be moved to new locations in response to customer demand 
all of our mobile offshore drilling units are designed for operations away from port for extended periods of time and have living quarters for the crews  a helicopter landing deck and storage space for pipe and drilling supplies 
our drilling fleet can be generally characterized as follows floaters  including drillships and semisubmersibles  and jackups 
also included in our fleet is a swamp barge drilling unit 
drillships are generally self propelled vessels  shaped like conventional ships  and are the most mobile of the major rig types 
all of our high specification drillships are equipped with a computer controlled dynamic positioning thruster system  which allows them to maintain position without anchors through the use of their onboard propulsion and station keeping systems 
drillships typically have greater load capacity than early generation semisubmersible rigs 
this enables them to carry more supplies on board  which often makes them better suited for drilling in remote locations where resupply is more difficult 
however  drillships are generally limited to operations in calmer water conditions than those in which semisubmersibles can operate 
we have three enterprise class and five enhanced enterprise class drillships  which are all equipped with our patented dual activity technology 
dual activity technology employs structures  equipment and techniques using two drilling stations within a single derrick to allow these drillships to perform simultaneous drilling tasks in a parallel rather than sequential manner  reducing critical path activity  to improve efficiency in both exploration and development drilling 
our enhanced enterprise class drillships offer improved reliability  increased pipe handling capacity  dual well control systems and flexible fluid capabilities and increased water depth and drilling depth 
semisubmersibles are floating vessels that can be submerged by means of a water ballast system such that the lower hulls are below the water surface during drilling operations 
these rigs are capable of maintaining their position over a well through the use of an anchoring system or a computer controlled dynamic positioning thruster system 
although most semisubmersible rigs are relocated with the assistance of tugs  some units are self propelled and move between locations under their own power when afloat on pontoons 
typically  semisubmersibles are better suited than drillships for operations in rougher water conditions 
we have three express class semisubmersibles  which are designed for mild environments and are equipped with the unique tri act derrick 
the tri act derrick was designed to reduce overall well construction costs  as it allows offline tubular and riser handling operations to occur at two sides of the derrick while the center portion of the derrick is being used for normal drilling operations through the rotary table 
our three development driller class semisubmersibles are equipped with our patented dual activity technology 
jackup rigs are mobile self elevating drilling platforms equipped with legs that can be lowered to the ocean floor until a foundation is established to support the drilling platform 
once a foundation is established  the drilling platform is then jacked further up the legs so that the platform is above the highest expected waves 
these rigs are generally suited for water depths of feet or less 
fleet categories we categorize the drilling units of our fleet as follows high specification floaters  consisting of our ultra deepwater floaters  deepwater floaters and harsh environment floaters  midwater floaters  high specification jackups  standard jackups and a swamp barge 
as of february   our fleet of rigs  excluding rigs under construction  was as follows high specification floaters  which are comprised of ultra deepwater floaters  deepwater floaters  and seven harsh environment floaters  midwater floaters  nine high specification jackups  standard jackups  and one swamp barge high specification floaters are specialized offshore drilling units that we categorize into three sub classifications based on their capabilities 
ultra deepwater floaters are equipped with high pressure mud pumps and are capable of drilling in water depths of  feet or greater 
deepwater floaters are generally those other semisubmersible rigs and drillships capable of drilling in water depths between  and  feet 
harsh environment floaters are capable of drilling in harsh environments in water depths between  and  feet and have greater displacement  which offers larger variable load capacity  more useable deck space and better motion characteristics 
midwater floaters are generally comprised of those non high specification semisubmersibles that have a water depth capacity of less than  feet 
high specification jackups have greater operational capabilities than standard jackups and are able to operate in harsh environments  and have higher capacity derricks  drawworks  mud systems and storage 
typically  high specification jackups also have deeper water depth capacity than standard jackups 
fleet status depending on market conditions  we may idle or stack non contracted rigs 
an idle rig is between contracts  readily available for operations  and operating costs are typically at or near normal levels 
a stacked rig is staffed by a reduced crew or has no crew and typically has reduced operating costs and is a preparing for an extended period of inactivity  b expected to continue to be inactive for an extended period  or c completing a period of extended inactivity 
stacked rigs will continue to incur operating costs at or above normal operating levels for to days following initiation of stacking 
some idle rigs and all stacked rigs require additional costs to return to service 
the actual cost to return to service  which in many instances could be significant and could fluctuate over time  depends upon various factors  including the availability and cost of shipyard facilities  cost of equipment and materials and the extent of repairs and maintenance that may ultimately be required 
we consider these factors  together with market conditions  length of contract  dayrate and other contract terms  when deciding whether to return a stacked rig to service 
we may  from time to time  consider marketing stacked rigs as accommodation units or for other alternative uses until drilling activity increases and we obtain drilling contracts for these units 
drilling units the following tables  presented as of february   provide certain specifications for our rigs 
unless otherwise noted  the stated location of each rig indicates either the current drilling location  if the rig is operating  or the next operating location  if the rig is in shipyard with a follow on contract 
as of february   we owned all of the drilling rigs in our fleet noted in the tables below  except for the following those specifically described as being owned through our interests in joint venture companies and petrobras  which is subject to a capital lease through august in addition to the rigs presented below  we also own and operate one swamp barge

markets our operations are geographically dispersed in oil and gas exploration and development areas throughout the world 
although the cost of moving a rig and the availability of rig moving vessels may cause the balance between supply and demand to vary between regions  significant variations do not tend to exist long term because of rig mobility 
consequently  we operate in a single  global offshore drilling market 
because our drilling rigs are mobile assets and are able to be moved according to prevailing market conditions  we cannot predict the percentage of our revenues that will be derived from particular geographic or political areas in future periods 
as of february   our fleet was located in the far east units  middle east units  west african countries other than nigeria and angola units  united states us gulf of mexico units  uk north sea units  india units  brazil units  nigeria units  norway eight units  angola four units  australia three units  the mediterranean two units  canada two units  and romania one unit 
in recent years  oil companies have placed increased emphasis on exploring for hydrocarbons in deeper waters 
this deepwater focus is due  in part  to technological developments that have made such exploration more feasible and cost effective 
therefore  water depth capability is a key component in determining rig suitability for a particular drilling project 
another distinguishing feature in some drilling market sectors is a rig s ability to operate in harsh environments  including extreme marine and climatic conditions and temperatures 
we categorize the market sectors in which we operate as follows deepwater  midwater  jackup and transition zone 
the deepwater and midwater market sectors are serviced by our semisubmersibles and drillships 
although the term deepwater as used in the drilling industry to denote a particular market sector can vary and continues to evolve with technological improvements  we generally view the deepwater market sector as that which begins in water depths of approximately  feet and extends to the maximum water depths in which rigs are capable of drilling  which is currently approximately  feet 
we view the midwater market sector as that which covers water depths of about feet to approximately  feet 
the jackup market sector begins at the outer limit of the transition zone and extends to water depths of about feet 
this sector has been developed to a significantly greater degree than the deepwater market sector because the shallower water depths have made it much more affordable and accessible than the deeper water market sectors 
the transition zone market sector is characterized by marshes  rivers  lakes  and shallow bay and coastal water areas 
we only operate in this sector using our swamp barge drilling rig located in southeast asia 
financial information about geographic areas the following table presents the geographic areas in which our operating revenues were earned and our long lived assets were located in millions years ended december  operating revenues us uk brazil other countries a total operating revenues a other countries represents countries in which we operate that individually had operating revenues or long lived assets representing less than percent of total operating revenues earned or total long lived assets for any of the periods presented

see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations outlook drilling market and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations performance and other key indicators 
contract drilling services our contracts to provide offshore drilling services are individually negotiated and vary in their terms and provisions 
we obtain most of our contracts through competitive bidding against other contractors 
drilling contracts generally provide for payment on a dayrate basis  with higher rates while the drilling unit is operating and lower rates or zero rates for periods of mobilization or when drilling operations are interrupted or restricted by equipment breakdowns  adverse environmental conditions or other conditions beyond our control 
a dayrate drilling contract generally extends over a period of time covering either the drilling of a single well or group of wells or covering a stated term 
certain of our contracts with customers may be cancelable at the option of the customer upon payment of an early termination payment 
such payments  however  may not fully compensate us for the loss of the contract 
contracts also customarily provide for either automatic termination or termination at the option of the customer typically without the payment of any termination fee  under various circumstances such as non performance  in the event of downtime or impaired performance caused by equipment or operational issues  or sustained periods of downtime due to force majeure events 
many of these events are beyond our control 
the contract term in some instances may be extended by the customer exercising options for the drilling of additional wells or for an additional term 
our contracts also typically include a provision that allows the customer to extend the contract to finish drilling a well in progress 
during periods of depressed market conditions  our customers may seek to renegotiate firm drilling contracts to reduce their obligations or may seek to repudiate their contracts 
suspension of drilling contracts will result in the reduction in or loss of dayrate for the period of the suspension 
if our customers cancel some of our contracts and we are unable to secure new contracts on a timely basis and on substantially similar terms  or if contracts are suspended for an extended period of time or if a number of our contracts are renegotiated  it could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations or cash flows 
see item a 
risk factors risks related to our business our drilling contracts may be terminated due to a number of events 
consistent with standard industry practice  our customers generally assume  and indemnify us against  well control and subsurface risks under dayrate contracts 
under all of our current drilling contracts  the operator indemnifies us for pollution damages in connection with reservoir fluids stemming from operations under the contract and we indemnify the operator for pollution from substances in our control that originate from the rig eg  diesel used onboard the rig or other fluids stored onboard the rig and above the water surface 
also  under all of our current drilling contracts  the operator indemnifies us against damage to the well or reservoir and loss of subsurface oil and gas and the cost of bringing the well under control 
however  our drilling contracts are individually negotiated  and the degree of indemnification we receive from the operator against the liabilities discussed above can vary from contract to contract  based on market conditions and customer requirements existing when the contract was negotiated 
in some instances  we have contractually agreed upon certain limits to our indemnification rights and can be responsible for damages up to a specified maximum dollar amount  which amount is usually million or less  although the amount can be greater depending on the nature of our liability 
in most instances in which we are indemnified for damages to the well  we have the responsibility to redrill the well at a reduced dayrate 
notwithstanding a contractual indemnity from a customer  there can be no assurance that our customers will be financially able to indemnify us or will otherwise honor their contractual indemnity obligations 
the interpretation and enforceability of a contractual indemnity depends upon the specific facts and circumstances involved  as governed by applicable laws  and may ultimately need to be decided by a court or other proceeding which will need to consider the specific contract language  the facts and applicable laws 
in connection with the macondo well incident  a court refused to enforce an indemnity in respect of certain penalties and punitive damages under the clean water act and the enforceability of an indemnity as to other matters may be limited 
the inability or other failure of our customers to fulfill their indemnification obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
see item legal proceedings macondo well incident contractual indemnity 
drilling management services we provide drilling management services primarily on a turnkey basis through applied drilling technology inc  our wholly owned subsidiary  which primarily operates in the us gulf of mexico  and through adt international  a division of one of our uk subsidiaries  which primarily operates in the north sea together  adti 
as part of our turnkey drilling services  we provide planning  engineering and management services beyond the scope of our traditional contract drilling business and  thereby  assume greater risk 
under turnkey arrangements  we typically assume responsibility for the design and execution of a well and deliver a logged or cased hole to an agreed depth for a guaranteed price for which payment is contingent upon successful completion of the well program 
in addition to turnkey drilling services  we participate in project management operations that include providing certain planning  management and engineering services  purchasing equipment and providing personnel and other logistical services to customers 
our project management services differ from turnkey drilling services in that the customer assumes control of the drilling operations and thereby retains the risks associated with the project 
revenues from these drilling management services represented less than six percent of our consolidated revenues for the year ended december  in the course of providing drilling management services  adti may either use a drilling rig in our fleet or contract for a rig owned by another contract driller 
integrated services from time to time  we provide well and logistics services in addition to our normal drilling services through third party contractors and our employees 
we refer to these other services as integrated services  which are generally subject to individual contractual agreements executed to meet specific customer needs and may be provided on either a dayrate  cost plus or fixed price basis  depending on the daily activity 
as of february   we were only performing such services in india 
revenues from these integrated services represented less than one percent of our consolidated revenues for the year ended december  joint venture  agency and sponsorship relationships and other investments in some areas of the world  local customs and practice or governmental requirements necessitate the formation of joint ventures with local participation 
we may or may not control these joint ventures 
we are an active participant in several joint venture drilling companies  principally in angola  india  indonesia  malaysia and nigeria 
local laws or customs in some areas of the world also effectively mandate establishment of a relationship with a local agent or sponsor 
when appropriate in these areas  we enter into agency or sponsorship agreements 
we hold a percent interest in transocean pacific drilling inc tpdi  a consolidated british virgin islands joint venture company formed by us and quantum pacific management limited  a cypriot company and successor in interest to pacific drilling limited quantum  to own and operate two ultra deepwater drillships named dhirubhai deepwater kg and dhirubhai deepwater kg under a management services agreement with tpdi  we provide operating management services for dhirubhai deepwater kg and dhirubhai deepwater kg quantum has the unilateral right to exchange its interest in the joint venture for our shares or cash  at an amount based on an appraisal of the fair value of the drillships  subject to certain adjustments  but it has not exercised this right

angco cayman limited  a cayman islands company  holds the remaining percent interest in addcl 
under a management services agreement with addcl  we provide operating management services for discoverer luanda 
beginning january   angco cayman limited will have the right to exchange its interest in the joint venture for cash at an amount based on an appraisal of the fair value of the drillship  subject to certain adjustments 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations related party transactions 
significant customers we engage in offshore drilling services for most of the leading international oil companies or their affiliates  as well as for many government controlled and independent oil companies 
our most significant customer in was bp plc together with its affiliates  bp  accounting for approximately percent of our operating revenues 
no other customer accounted for percent or more of our operating revenues 
employees we require highly skilled personnel to operate our drilling units 
consequently  we conduct extensive personnel recruiting  training and safety programs 
at december   we had approximately  employees  including approximately  persons engaged through contract labor providers 
some of our employees working in angola  the uk  norway and australia are represented by  and some of our contracted labor work under  collective bargaining agreements 
many of these represented individuals are working under agreements that are subject to annual salary negotiation 
these negotiations could result in higher personnel expenses  other increased costs or increased operational restrictions as the outcome of such negotiations apply to all offshore employees not just the union members 
legislation has been introduced in the us congress that could encourage additional unionization efforts in the us  as well as increase the chances that such efforts succeed 
additional unionization efforts  if successful  new collective bargaining agreements or work stoppages could materially increase our labor costs and operating restrictions 
technological innovation we are a leading international provider of offshore contract drilling services and drilling management services for oil and gas wells 
we specialize in technically demanding sectors of the global offshore drilling business 
our fleet is considered one of the most versatile in the world with a particular focus on deepwater and harsh environment drilling capabilities 
since launching the offshore industry s first jackup drilling rig in  we have achieved a long history of technological innovations  including the first dynamically positioned drillship  the first rig to drill year round in the north sea  the first semisubmersible rig for sub arctic  year round operations  and the latest generations of ultra deepwater drillships and semisubmersibles 
fifteen rigs in our existing fleet are equipped with our patented dual activity technology  which allows our rigs to perform simultaneous drilling tasks in a parallel rather than sequential manner and reduces critical path activity while improving efficiency in both exploration and development drilling 
additionally  three rigs in our existing fleet are equipped with the unique tri act derrick  which we have patented in certain market sectors in which we operate 
the tri act derrick was designed to reduce overall well construction costs  as it allows offline tubular and riser handling operations to occur at two sides of the derrick while the center portion of the derrick is being used for normal drilling operations through the rotary table 
the effective use of and continued improvements in technology are critical to maintaining our competitive position within the drilling services industry 
we expect to continue to develop technology internally or to acquire technology through strategic acquisitions 
environmental regulation for a discussion of the effects of environmental regulation  see item a 
risk factors risks related to our business compliance with or breach of environmental laws can be costly and could limit our operations 
our operations are subject to a variety of global environmental regulations 
we monitor environmental regulation in each country of operation and  while we see an increase in general environmental regulation  we have made and will continue to make the required expenditures to comply with current and future environmental requirements 
we make expenditures to further our commitment to environmental improvement and the setting of a global environmental standard as part of our wider corporate responsibility effort 
we assess the environmental impacts of our business  specifically in the areas of greenhouse gas emissions  climate change  discharges and waste management 
our actions are designed to reduce risk in our current and future operations  to promote sound environmental management and to create a proactive environmental program 
from a global perspective  we continue to assess further projects designed to reduce our overall emissions 
to date  we have not incurred significant costs in order to comply with recent legislation  and we do not believe that our compliance with such requirements will have a material adverse effect on our competitive position  consolidated results of operations or cash flows

risk factors risks related to our business the macondo well incident could result in increased expenses and decreased revenues  which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on us 
numerous lawsuits have been filed against us and unaffiliated defendants related to the macondo well incident 
we are subject to claims alleging that we are jointly and severally liable  along with bp and others  for damages arising from the macondo well incident 
we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant legal fees and costs in responding to these matters 
we may also be subject to governmental fines or penalties 
although we have excess liability insurance coverage  our personal injury and other third party liability insurance coverage is subject to deductibles and overall aggregate policy limits 
there can be no assurance that our insurance will ultimately be adequate to cover all of our potential liabilities in connection with these matters 
for a discussion of the potential impact of the failure of the macondo well operator to honor its indemnification obligations to us  see we could experience a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position  results of operations and cash flows to the extent any of the operator s indemnification obligations to us are not enforceable or the operator does not indemnify us below 
if we ultimately incur substantial liabilities in connection with these matters with respect to which we are neither insured nor indemnified  those liabilities could have a material adverse effect on us 
the incident has had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
our business has been negatively impacted by the loss of revenue from deepwater horizon 
the backlog associated with the deepwater horizon drilling contract was approximately million through the end of the contract term in we do not carry insurance for business interruption or loss of hire 
in the two years ended december   we estimate that the macondo well incident had a direct and indirect effect of greater than billion in lost revenues and incremental costs and expenses associated with extended shipyard projects and increased downtime  both as a result of complying with the enhanced regulations and our customers requirements 
in one case  the increased downtime has resulted in the recent termination of one of our contracts  which represented backlog of approximately million 
in the three months ended december   we recognized an estimated loss of billion in connection with loss contingencies associated with the macondo well incident that we believe are probable and for which a reasonable estimate can be made 
additionally  in the years ended december  and  we incurred incremental costs  primarily associated with legal expenses for lawsuits and investigations  net of expected insurance recoveries  in the amount of million and million  respectively 
collectively  the lost contract backlog from the incident and from the recent termination  lost revenues and incremental expenses from extended shipyard projects and increased downtime  loss contingencies associated with the incident and other incremental costs have had an effect of greater than billion 
we are currently unable to estimate the full impact the macondo well incident will have on us 
we have recognized a liability for estimated loss contingencies that we believe are probable and for which a reasonable estimate can be made 
as of december   we have recognized a liability for such loss contingencies in the amount of billion 
this liability takes into account certain events related to the litigation and investigations arising out of the incident 
there are loss contingencies related to the macondo well incident that we believe are reasonably possible and for which we do not believe a reasonable estimate can be made 
these contingencies could increase the liabilities we ultimately recognize 
our estimates involve a significant amount of judgment 
as a result of new information or future developments  some of which could occur very soon  we may adjust our estimated loss contingencies arising out of the macondo well incident  and the resulting liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
our business may also be adversely impacted by any negative publicity relating to the incident and us  any negative perceptions about us by customers  the skilled personnel that we require to support our operations or others  any further increases in premiums for insurance or difficulty in obtaining coverage and the diversion of management s attention from our other operations to focus on matters relating to the incident 
in addition  the macondo well incident could negatively impact our ongoing business relationship with bp  which accounted for approximately percent of our consolidated operating revenues for the year ended december  ultimately  these factors could have a material adverse effect on our statement of financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we could experience a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position  results of operations and cash flows to the extent any of the macondo well operator s indemnification obligations to us are not enforceable or the operator does not indemnify us 
the combined response team to the macondo well incident was unable to stem the flow of hydrocarbons from the well prior to the sinking of deepwater horizon 
the resulting spill of hydrocarbons was the most extensive in us history 
according to its public filings  the operator has recognized cumulative pre tax losses of billion in relation to the spill 
as described under part i 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contingencies macondo well incident contractual indemnity  under the deepwater horizon drilling contract  bp agreed to indemnify us with respect to certain matters  and we agreed to indemnify bp with respect to certain matters 
we could ultimately experience a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position  results of operations and cash flows to the extent that bp does not honor its indemnification obligations  including by reason of financial or legal restrictions  or our insurance policies do not fully cover these amounts 
in april  bp filed a claim seeking a declaration that it is not liable to us in contribution  indemnification  or otherwise  and further  bp has brought claims against us seeking indemnification and contribution 
on november   we filed a motion for partial summary judgment regarding the scope and enforceability of the indemnity obligations in the drilling contract 
on january   the court ruled that the drilling contract requires bp to indemnify us for compensatory damages asserted by third parties against us related to pollution that did not originate on or above the surface of the water  even if the claim is the result of our strict liability  negligence  or gross negligence 
the court also held that bp does not owe us indemnity to the extent that we are held liable for punitive damages or civil penalties under the clean water act 
the court deferred ruling on bp s argument that we breached the drilling contract or materially increased bp s risk or prejudiced its rights so as to impair bp s indemnity obligations 
the law generally considers contractual indemnity for criminal fines and penalties to be against public policy 
investigations are ongoing in connection with the macondo well incident  the outcome of which are unknown and could have a material adverse effect on us 
on june   we received a letter from the us department of justice doj asking us to meet with them to discuss our financial responsibilities in connection with the macondo well incident and requesting that we provide them certain financial and organizational information 
the letter also requested that we provide the doj advance notice of certain corporate actions involving the transfer of cash or other assets outside the ordinary course of business 
we have engaged in discussions with the doj and have responded to their document requests  and we expect these discussions to continue 
in addition  on december   the doj filed a civil lawsuit against us and other unaffiliated defendants 
the complaint alleges claims under the oil pollution act of opa and the clean water act  including claims for per barrel civil penalties of up to  per barrel or up to  per barrel if gross negligence or willful misconduct is established  and the doj reserved its rights to amend the complaint to add new claims and defendants 
the complaint asserts that all defendants are jointly and severally liable for all removal costs and damages resulting from the macondo well incident 
on december   the doj filed a motion for partial summary judgment seeking a ruling that we were jointly and severally liable under opa  and liable for civil penalties under the clean water act  for all discharges from the macondo well on the theory that the discharges not only came from the well  but also came from the blowout preventer and riser  appurtenances of deepwater horizon 
on february   the us district court  eastern district of louisiana the mdl court ruled that we are not liable as a responsible party for damages under opa with respect to the below surface discharges from the macondo well 
the court also ruled that the below surface discharge was discharged from the well facility  and not from the deepwater horizon vessel  within the meaning of the clean water act  and that we therefore are not liable for such discharges as an owner of the vessel under the clean water act 
however  the court ruled that the issue of whether we could be held liable for such discharge under the clean water act as an operator of the well facility could not be resolved on summary judgment 
the court did not determine whether we could be liable for removal costs under opa  or the extent of such removal costs 
in addition to the civil complaint  the doj served us with civil investigative demands on december  these demands were part of an investigation by the doj to determine if we made false claims  or false statements in support of claims  in connection with the operator s acquisition of the leasehold interest in the mississippi canyon block  gulf of mexico and drilling operations on deepwater horizon 
the doj is also conducting a criminal investigation into the macondo well incident 
the doj task force is investigating possible violations  by us and certain unaffiliated parties  of the clean water act  the migratory bird treaty act  the refuse act  the endangered species act  and the seaman s manslaughter act  among other federal statutes  and possible criminal liabilities including fines under those statutes and under the alternative fines act 
under the alternative fines act  a corporate defendant convicted of a criminal offense may be subject to a fine in the amount of twice the gross pecuniary loss suffered by third parties as a result of the offense 
in addition  a number of other governmental and regulatory bodies as well as we and other companies have conducted investigations into the macondo well incident 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contingencies macondo well incident investigations 
we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the doj s lawsuit or any of the investigations  including any impact on the litigation related to the macondo well incident  the extent to which we could be subject to fines  sanctions or other penalties  the potential impact of implementing measures that may result from the investigations or the costs to be incurred in completing the investigations 
the continuing effects of the enhanced regulations enacted following the macondo well incident could materially and adversely affect our worldwide operations 
new governmental safety and environmental requirements applicable to both deepwater and shallow water operations have been adopted for drilling in the us gulf of mexico following the macondo well incident 
in order to obtain drilling permits  operators must submit applications that demonstrate compliance with the enhanced regulations  which require independent third party inspections  certification of well design and well control equipment and emergency response plans in the event of a blowout  among other requirements 
operators have  and may continue to have  difficulties obtaining drilling permits in the us gulf of mexico 
in addition  the oil and gas industry has adopted new equipment and operating standards such as the american petroleum institute recommended practice relating to the installation and testing of well control equipment 
these new safety and environmental guidelines and standards and any further new guidelines or standards the us government or industry may issue or any other steps the us government or industry may take  could disrupt or delay operations  increase the cost of operations  increase out of service time or reduce the area of operations for drilling rigs in us and us offshore areas 
other governments could take similar actions relating to implementing new safety and environmental regulations in the future 
additionally  some of our customers have elected to voluntarily comply with some or all of the new inspections  certification requirements and safety and environmental guidelines on rigs operating outside of the us gulf of mexico 
additional governmental regulations and requirements concerning licensing  taxation  equipment specifications and training requirements or the voluntary adoption of such requirements or guidelines by our customers could increase the costs of our operations  increase certification and permitting requirements  increase review periods and impose increased liability on offshore operations 
the continuing effects of the enhanced regulations may also decrease the demand for drilling services  negatively affect dayrates and increase out of service time  which could ultimately have a material adverse affect on our revenue and profitability 
we are unable to predict the full impact that the continuing effects of the enhanced regulations will have on our operations 
the frade field incident in brazil could result in increased expenses and decreased revenues  which could ultimately have a material impact on us 
on or about november   oil was released from fissures in the ocean floor in the vicinity of a development well being drilled by chevron off the coast of rio de janeiro in the campo de frade field with our deepwater floater sedco in connection with the incident  authorities in brazil have filed a civil action against chevron and us  and a brazilian federal police marshal has filed a report recommending the criminal indictment of chevron and us 
we may be subject to liability for civil damage and governmental fines or penalties 
if we ultimately incur substantial liabilities in connection with these matters for which we are neither insured nor indemnified  those liabilities could adversely affect our consolidated statement of financial position  results of operations or cash flow 
in addition  there is a risk that brazilian authorities could temporarily or permanently enjoin us from further operations in brazil 
for the year ended december   our operations in brazil accounted for percent of our consolidated operating revenues 
if we are enjoined from operating in brazil for a substantial period of time  the resulting decrease in demand for our drilling services could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we have a substantial amount of debt  and we may lose the ability to obtain future financing and suffer competitive disadvantages 
our overall debt level was approximately billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
this substantial level of debt and other obligations could have significant adverse consequences on our business and future prospects  including the following we may not be able to obtain financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt service requirements or other purposes  we may not be able to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to service the debt  we could become more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions  including increases in interest rates  particularly given our substantial indebtedness  some of which bears interest at variable rates  we may not be able to meet financial ratios or satisfy certain other conditions included in our bank credit agreements  which could result in our inability to meet requirements for borrowings under our bank credit agreements or a default under these agreements and trigger cross default provisions in our other debt instruments  less levered competitors could have a competitive advantage because they have lower debt service requirements  and we may be less able to take advantage of significant business opportunities and to react to changes in market or industry conditions than our competitors 
credit rating agencies may lower our corporate credit ratings below investment grade 
credit rating agencies may downgrade our credit ratings to non investment grade levels 
such ratings levels could limit our ability to refinance our existing debt  could cause us to refinance or issue debt with less favorable terms and conditions and could increase certain fees under our credit facilities and interest rates under agreements governing certain of our senior notes and cause indebtedness of approximately million to become due 
in addition  such ratings levels could negatively impact current and prospective customers willingness to transact business with us and could impose additional insurance requirements 
suppliers and financial institutions may lower or eliminate the level of credit provided through payment terms or intraday funding when dealing with us thereby increasing the need for higher levels of cash on hand  which would decrease our ability to repay debt balances 
since the macondo well incident  moody s investors service  standard poor s and fitch have each downgraded their ratings of our senior unsecured debt on more than one occasion  and moody s investors service currently has such debt on review for further downgrade 
any further downgrade by any of the rating agencies could have the effect described above 
we cannot provide assurance that our credit ratings will not be downgraded to a non investment grade rating in the near future 
see the macondo well incident could result in increased expenses and decreased revenues  which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on us 
compliance with or breach of environmental laws can be costly and could limit our operations 
our operations are subject to regulations controlling the discharge of materials into the environment  requiring removal and cleanup of materials that may harm the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 
for example  as an operator of mobile offshore drilling units in navigable us waters and some offshore areas  we may be liable for damages and costs incurred in connection with oil spills or waste disposals related to those operations 
laws and regulations protecting the environment have become more stringent in recent years  and may in some cases impose strict liability  rendering a person liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence 
these laws and regulations may expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others or for acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time they were performed 
the application of these requirements or the adoption of new requirements could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
numerous lawsuits  including one brought by the doj  allege that we may have liability under the environmental laws relating to the macondo well incident 
if we are charged with or convicted of certain criminal environmental offenses  we may be subject to suspension or debarment as a contractor or subcontractor on certain government contracts  including leases 
see the macondo well incident could result in increased expenses and decreased revenues  which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on us 
there is no assurance that we can obtain enforceable indemnities against liability for pollution  well and environmental damages in all of our contracts or that  in the event of extensive pollution and environmental damages  our customers will have the financial capability to fulfill their indemnity obligations to us 
a court in the litigation related to the macondo well incident has refused to enforce all aspects of our indemnity with respect to certain environmental related liabilities 
our business depends on the level of activity in the offshore oil and gas industry  which is significantly affected by volatile oil and gas prices and other factors 
our business depends on the level of activity in oil and gas exploration  development and production in offshore areas worldwide 
demand for our services depends on oil and natural gas industry activity and expenditure levels that are directly affected by trends in oil and  to a lesser extent  natural gas prices 
demand for our services is particularly sensitive to the level of exploration  development  and production activity of  and the corresponding capital spending by  oil and natural gas companies  including national oil companies 
any prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices could depress the immediate levels of exploration  development  and production activity 
perceptions of longer term lower oil and natural gas prices by oil and gas companies could similarly reduce or defer major expenditures given the long term nature of many large scale development projects 
lower levels of activity result in a corresponding decline in the demand for our services  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability 
oil and gas prices and market expectations of potential changes in these prices significantly affect this level of activity 
however  higher commodity prices do not necessarily translate into increased drilling activity since customers expectations of future commodity prices typically drive demand for our rigs 
also  increased competition for customers drilling budgets could come from  among other areas  land based energy markets in africa  russia  western asian countries  the middle east  the us and elsewhere 
the availability of quality drilling prospects  exploration success  relative production costs  the stage of reservoir development and political and regulatory environments also affect customers drilling campaigns 
worldwide military  political and economic events have contributed to oil and gas price volatility and are likely to do so in the future 
oil and gas prices are extremely volatile and are affected by numerous factors  including the following worldwide demand for oil and gas including economic activity in the us and other energy consuming markets  the ability of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec to set and maintain production levels and pricing  the level of production in non opec countries  the policies of various governments regarding exploration and development of their oil and gas reserves  advances in exploration and development technology  and the worldwide military and political environment  including uncertainty or instability resulting from an escalation or additional outbreak of armed hostilities  civil unrest or other crises in the middle east or other geographic areas or further acts of terrorism in the us  or elsewhere 
our industry is highly competitive and cyclical  with intense price competition 
the offshore contract drilling industry is highly competitive with numerous industry participants  none of which has a dominant market share 
drilling contracts are traditionally awarded on a competitive bid basis 
intense price competition is often the primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job  although rig availability and the quality and technical capability of service and equipment may also be considered 
our industry has historically been cyclical and is impacted by oil and gas price levels and volatility 
there have been periods of high demand  short rig supply and high dayrates  followed by periods of low demand  excess rig supply and low dayrates 
changes in commodity prices can have a dramatic effect on rig demand  and periods of excess rig supply intensify the competition in the industry and often result in rigs being idle for long periods of time 
since the onset of the worldwide financial and economic downturn  we have experienced weakness in our midwater floater  high specification jackups and standard jackup market sectors 
we have idled and stacked rigs  and may in the future idle or stack additional rigs or enter into lower dayrate contracts in response to market conditions 
we cannot predict when any idled or stacked rigs will return to service 
during prior periods of high dayrates and utilization  industry participants have increased the supply of rigs by ordering the construction of new units 
this has typically resulted in an oversupply of rigs and has caused a subsequent decline in dayrates and utilization  sometimes for extended periods of time 
presently  there are numerous recently constructed high specification floaters and jackups that have entered the market  and there are more that are under contract for construction 
the entry into service of these new units has increased and will continue to increase supply and could curtail a strengthening  or trigger a reduction  in dayrates as rigs are absorbed into the active fleet 
additionally  as a result of the aker drilling acquisition we are expected to take delivery  in  of two ultra deepwater drillships currently under construction 
we have not yet secured a drilling contract for either drillship 
our failure to secure a drilling contract for either rig prior to its deployment could adversely affect our results of operations 
any further increase in construction of new units would likely exacerbate the negative impact on dayrates and utilization 
lower dayrates and utilization could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
we rely heavily on a relatively small number of customers and the loss of a significant customer or a dispute that leads to the loss of a customer could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
we engage in offshore drilling services for most of the leading international oil companies or their affiliates  as well as for many government controlled and independent oil companies 
our most significant customer in was bp  accounting for percent of our operating revenues for the year ended december  as of february   the contract backlog associated with our contracts with bp and its affiliates was billion 
our relationship with bp  whose affiliate was the operator of the macondo well  has been and could continue to be negatively impacted by the macondo well incident 
the loss of this customer or another significant customer could  at least in the short term  have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 
our operating and maintenance costs will not necessarily fluctuate in proportion to changes in operating revenues 
our operating and maintenance costs will not necessarily fluctuate in proportion to changes in operating revenues 
costs for operating a rig are generally fixed or only semi variable regardless of the dayrate being earned 
in addition  should our rigs incur unplanned downtime while on contract or idle time between contracts  we typically will not reduce the staff on those rigs because we will use the crew to prepare the rig for its next contract 
during times of reduced activity  reductions in costs may not be immediate as portions of the crew may be required to prepare rigs for stacking  after which time the crew members are assigned to active rigs or dismissed 
as our rigs are mobilized from one geographic location to another  the labor and other operating and maintenance costs can vary significantly 
in general  labor costs increase primarily due to higher salary levels and inflation 
equipment maintenance expenses fluctuate depending upon the type of activity the unit is performing and the age and condition of the equipment  and these expenses could increase for short or extended periods as a result of regulatory or customer requirements that raise maintenance standards above historical levels 
contract preparation expenses vary based on the scope and length of contract preparation required and the duration of the firm contractual period over which such expenditures are amortized 
our shipyard projects and operations are subject to delays and cost overruns 
as of february   we had two ultra deepwater floater and four high specification jackup newbuild rig projects 
we also have a variety of other more limited shipyard projects at any given time 
these shipyard projects are subject to the risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any such construction project resulting from numerous factors  including the following availability of suppliers to recertify equipment for enhanced regulations  shipyard availability  shortages of equipment  materials or skilled labor  unscheduled delays in the delivery of ordered materials and equipment  engineering problems  including those relating to the commissioning of newly designed equipment  work stoppages  customer acceptance delays  weather interference or storm damage  civil unrest  unanticipated cost increases  and difficulty in obtaining necessary permits or approvals 
these factors may contribute to cost variations and delays in the delivery of our newbuild units and other rigs undergoing shipyard projects 
delays in the delivery of these units would result in delay in contract commencement  resulting in a loss of revenue to us  and may also cause customers to terminate or shorten the term of the drilling contract for the rig pursuant to applicable late delivery clauses 
in the event of termination of one of these contracts  we may not be able to secure a replacement contract on as favorable terms  if at all 
our operations also rely on a significant supply of capital and consumable spare parts and equipment to maintain and repair our fleet 
we also rely on the supply of ancillary services  including supply boats and helicopters 
shortages in materials  delays in the delivery of necessary spare parts  equipment or other materials  or the unavailability of ancillary services could negatively impact our future operations and result in increases in rig downtime  and delays in the repair and maintenance of our fleet 
our drilling contracts may be terminated due to a number of events 
certain of our contracts with customers may be cancelable at the option of the customer upon payment of an early termination payment 
such payments may not  however  fully compensate us for the loss of the contract 
contracts also customarily provide for either automatic termination or termination at the option of the customer typically without the payment of any termination fee  under various circumstances such as non performance  as a result of downtime or impaired performance caused by equipment or operational issues  or sustained periods of downtime due to force majeure events 
many of these events are beyond our control 
during periods of depressed market conditions  we are subject to an increased risk of our customers seeking to repudiate their contracts  including through claims of non performance 
our customers ability to perform their obligations under their drilling contracts with us may also be negatively impacted by the economic downturn 
if our customers cancel some of our contracts  and we are unable to secure new contracts on a timely basis and on substantially similar terms  or if contracts are suspended for an extended period of time or if a number of our contracts are renegotiated  it could adversely affect our consolidated statement of financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
our current backlog of contract drilling revenue may not be fully realized 
our contract backlog as of february  was approximately billion 
this amount represents the firm term of the contract multiplied by the contractual operating rate  which may be higher than the actual dayrate we receive or we may receive other dayrates included in the contract such as waiting on weather rate  repair rate  standby rate or force majeure rate 
the contractual operating dayrate may also be higher than the actual dayrate we receive because of a number of factors  including rig downtime or suspension of operations 
in certain contracts  the dayrate may be reduced to zero or result in customer credit against future dayrate if  for example  repairs extend beyond a stated period of time 
our contract backlog includes signed drilling contracts and  in some cases  other definitive agreements awaiting contract execution 
we may not be able to realize the full amount of our contract backlog due to events beyond our control 
in addition  some of our customers have experienced liquidity issues  and these liquidity issues could increase if commodity prices decline to lower levels for an extended period of time 
liquidity issues could lead our customers to go into bankruptcy or could encourage our customers to seek to repudiate  cancel or renegotiate these agreements for various reasons  as described under our drilling contracts may be terminated due to a number of events above 
our inability to realize the full amount of our contract backlog may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the global nature of our operations involves additional risks 
we operate in various regions throughout the world  which may expose us to political and other uncertainties  including risks of terrorist acts  war  piracy and civil disturbances  seizure  expropriation or nationalization of equipment  imposition of trade barriers  import export quotas  wage and price controls  changes in law and regulatory requirements  including changes in interpretation and enforcement  damage to our equipment or violence directed at our employees  including kidnappings  civil unrest resulting in suspension of operations  complications associated with supplying  repairing and replacing equipment in remote locations  the inability to move income or capital  and currency exchange fluctuations 
our non us contract drilling operations are subject to various laws and regulations in certain countries in which we operate  including laws and regulations relating to the import and export  equipment and operation of drilling units  currency conversions and repatriation  oil and gas exploration and development  and taxation of offshore earnings and earnings of expatriate personnel 
we are also subject to the us treasury department s office of foreign assets control ofac and other us laws and regulations governing our international operations 
in addition  various state and municipal governments  universities and other investors have proposed or adopted divestment and other initiatives regarding investments including  with respect to state governments  by state retirement systems in companies that do business with countries that have been designated as state sponsors of terrorism by the us state department 
our internal compliance program has identified and we have self reported a potential ofac compliance issue involving the shipment of goods by a freight forwarder through iran  a country that has been designated as a state sponsor of terrorism by the us state department 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contingencies regulatory matters 
we have also operated rigs in myanmar  a country that is subject to some us trading sanctions 
we have received and responded to an administrative subpoena from ofac concerning our operations in myanmar and a follow up administrative subpoena from ofac with questions relating to the previous myanmar operations subpoena response and the self reported shipment through iran matter 
failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations  including those relating to sanctions and export restrictions  may subject us to criminal sanctions or civil remedies  including fines  denial of export privileges  injunctions or seizures of assets 
investors could view any potential violations of ofac regulations negatively  which could adversely affect our reputation and the market for our shares 
governments in some foreign countries have become increasingly active in regulating and controlling the ownership of concessions and companies holding concessions  the exploration for oil and gas and other aspects of the oil and gas industries in their countries  including local content requirements for participating in tenders for certain drilling contracts 
many governments favor or effectively require the awarding of drilling contracts to local contractors or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of  or purchase supplies from  a particular jurisdiction 
in addition  government action  including initiatives by opec  may continue to cause oil or gas price volatility 
in some areas of the world  this governmental activity has adversely affected the amount of exploration and development work by major oil companies and may continue to do so 
a substantial portion of our drilling contracts are partially payable in local currency 
those amounts may exceed our local currency needs  leading to the accumulation of excess local currency  which  in certain instances  may be subject to either temporary blocking or other difficulties converting to us dollars 
excess amounts of local currency may be exposed to the risk of currency exchange losses 
the shipment of goods  services and technology across international borders subjects us to extensive trade laws and regulations 
our import and export activities are governed by unique customs laws and regulations in each of the countries where we operate 
moreover  many countries  including the us  control the import and export of certain goods  services and technology and impose related import and export recordkeeping and reporting obligations 
governments also may impose economic sanctions against certain countries  persons and other entities that may restrict or prohibit transactions involving such countries  persons and entities  and we are also subject to the us anti boycott law 
the laws and regulations concerning import and export activity  recordkeeping and reporting  import and export control and economic sanctions are complex and constantly changing 
these laws and regulations may be enacted  amended  enforced or interpreted in a manner materially impacting our operations 
the global economic downturn may increase some foreign government s efforts to enact  enforce  amend or interpret laws and regulations as a method to increase revenue 
shipments can be delayed and denied import or export for a variety of reasons  some of which are outside our control and some of which may result from failure to comply with existing legal and regulatory regimes 
shipping delays or denials could cause unscheduled operational downtime 
an inability to obtain visas and work permits for our employees on a timely basis could hurt our operations and have an adverse effect on our business 
our ability to operate worldwide depends on our ability to obtain the necessary visas and work permits for our personnel to travel in and out of  and to work in  the jurisdictions in which we operate 
governmental actions in some of the jurisdictions in which we operate may make it difficult for us to move our personnel in and out of these jurisdictions by delaying or withholding the approval of these permits 
for example  in the past few years  we have experienced considerable difficulty in obtaining the necessary visas and work permits for our employees to work in angola  where we operate a number of rigs 
if we are not able to obtain visas and work permits for the employees we need to operate our rigs on a timely basis  we might not be able to perform our obligations under our drilling contracts  which could allow our customers to cancel the contracts 
if our customers cancel some of our contracts  and we are unable to secure new contracts on a timely basis and on substantially similar terms  it could adversely affect our consolidated statement of financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
failure to comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act and the bribery act recently enacted by the uk could result in fines  criminal penalties  drilling contract terminations and an adverse effect on our business 
the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and similar anti bribery laws in other jurisdictions  including the bribery act which became effective in the uk on july   generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 
we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced corruption to some degree and  in certain circumstances  strict compliance with anti bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices 
if we are found to be liable for fcpa violations or violations under the bribery act  either due to our own acts or our omissions or due to the acts or omissions of others  including our partners in our various joint ventures  we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
civil penalties under the anti bribery provisions of the fcpa could range up to  per violation  with a criminal fine up to the greater of million per violation or twice the gross pecuniary gain to us or twice the gross pecuniary loss to others  if larger 
civil penalties under the accounting provisions of the fcpa can range up to  per violation and a company that knowingly commits a violation can be fined up to million per violation 
in addition  both the sec and the doj could assert that conduct extending over a period of time may constitute multiple violations for purposes of assessing the penalty amounts 
often  dispositions for these types of matters result in modifications to business practices and compliance programs and possibly the appointment of a monitor to review future business and practices with the goal of ensuring compliance with the fcpa 
on november   we reached a settlement with the sec and the doj with respect to certain charges relating to the anti bribery and books and records provisions of the fcpa 
in november  under the terms of the settlements  we paid a total of approximately million in penalties  interest and disgorgement of profits 
we have also consented to the entry of a civil injunction in two sec actions and have entered into a three year deferred prosecution agreement with the doj the dpa 
in connection with the dpa  we have agreed to implement and maintain certain internal controls  policies and procedures 
for the duration of the dpa  we are also obligated to provide an annual written report to the doj of our efforts and progress in maintaining and enhancing our compliance policies and procedures 
in the event the doj determines that we have knowingly violated the terms of the dpa  the doj may impose an extension of the term of the agreement or  if the doj determines we have breached the dpa  the doj may pursue criminal charges or a civil or administrative action against us 
the doj may also find  in its sole discretion  that a change in circumstances has eliminated the need for the corporate compliance reporting obligations of the dpa and may terminate the dpa prior to the three year term 
failure to comply with the terms of the dpa may impact our operations and any resulting fines may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows 
we could also face fines  sanctions and other penalties from authorities in the relevant foreign jurisdictions  including prohibition of our participating in or curtailment of business operations in those jurisdictions and the seizure of rigs or other assets 
our customers in those jurisdictions could seek to impose penalties or take other actions adverse to our interests 
we could also face other third party claims by agents  stockholders  debt holders  or other interest holders or constituents of our company 
in addition  disclosure of the subject matter of the investigation could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to obtain new business or retain existing business from our current customers and potential customers  to attract and retain employees and to access the capital markets 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contingencies regulatory matters 
our labor costs and the operating restrictions under which we operate could increase as a result of collective bargaining negotiations and changes in labor laws and regulations 
some of our employees working in angola  the uk  norway and australia  are represented by  and some of our contracted labor work under  collective bargaining agreements 
many of these represented individuals are working under agreements that are subject to annual salary negotiation 
these negotiations could result in higher personnel expenses  other increased costs or increased operational restrictions as the outcome of such negotiations apply to all offshore employees not just the union members 
legislation has been introduced in the us congress that could encourage additional unionization efforts in the us  as well as increase the chances that such efforts succeed 
additional unionization efforts  if successful  new collective bargaining agreements or work stoppages could materially increase our labor costs and operating restrictions 
worldwide financial and economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our revenue  profitability and financial position 
the worldwide financial and economic downturn reduced the availability of liquidity and credit to fund the continuation and expansion of industrial business operations worldwide 
the shortage of liquidity and credit combined with losses in worldwide equity markets led to an extended worldwide economic recession 
our ability to access the capital markets may be severely restricted at a time when we would like  or need  to access such markets  which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions 
recent worldwide economic conditions impacted lenders participating in our credit facilities and our customers  and another economic shock could cause them to fail to meet their obligations to us 
the slowdown in economic activity caused by the recession also reduced worldwide demand for energy and resulted in an extended period of lower oil and natural gas prices 
crude oil prices  although rebounded from the low levels experienced in early  have declined from record levels in july  and natural gas prices have also experienced sharp declines 
declines in commodity prices  along with difficult conditions in the credit markets  have had a negative impact on our business  and this impact could continue or worsen 
our business involves numerous operating hazards 
our operations are subject to the usual hazards inherent in the drilling of oil and gas wells  such as blowouts  reservoir damage  loss of production  loss of well control  punch throughs  craterings  fires and natural disasters such as hurricanes and tropical storms 
we may also be subject to property  environmental and other damage claims by oil and gas companies 
our insurance policies and contractual rights to indemnity may not adequately cover losses  and we do not have insurance coverage or rights to indemnity for all risks 
there are also risks following the loss of control of a well  such as a blowout or cratering  including the cost to regain control of or redrill the well and associated pollution 
damage to the environment could also result from our operations  particularly through oil spillage or extensive uncontrolled fires 
the south china sea  the northwest coast of australia and the us gulf of mexico area are subject to typhoons  hurricanes or other extreme weather conditions on a relatively frequent basis  and our drilling rigs in these regions may be exposed to damage or total loss by these storms  some of which may not be covered by insurance 
the occurrence of these events could result in the suspension of drilling operations  damage to or destruction of the equipment involved and injury to or death of rig personnel 
some experts believe global climate change could increase the frequency and severity of these extreme weather conditions 
we are also subject to personal injury and other claims by rig personnel as a result of our drilling operations 
operations also may be suspended because of machinery breakdowns  abnormal drilling conditions  failure of subcontractors to perform or supply goods or services  or personnel shortages 
in addition  offshore drilling operations are subject to perils peculiar to marine operations  including capsizing  grounding  collision and loss or damage from severe weather 
we have two main types of insurance coverage hull and machinery coverage for property damage and excess liability coverage  which generally covers offshore risks  such as personal injury  third party property claims  and third party non crew claims  including wreck removal and pollution 
we generally have no coverage for hull and machinery exposure for named storms in the us gulf of mexico and war perils worldwide 
we also generally self insure coverage on our standard jackup fleet and our swamp barge for expenses incurred by adti and cmi related to well control and redrill liability for well blowouts 
as of december  the aggregate net carrying amount of the standard jackup fleet and swamp barge is approximately billion 
with respect to our hull and machinery coverage  we maintain a million per occurrence deductible for damage to our rigs and offshore drilling equipment included in the coverage 
however  in the event of a total loss of such a drilling unit there is no deductible 
we also maintain per occurrence deductibles on such rigs that generally range up to million for various third party liabilities and an additional aggregate annual self insured retention of million 
with respect to the remaining million excess liability coverage  we generally retain the risk for any liability in excess of this coverage  however  our wholly owned captive insurance company has underwritten million of this policy in addition to the million self insured retention noted above  and we re insured million of this amount in there is no guarantee that we will be successful in re insuring any or all of this amount  and we may retain the risks associated with this portion of our excess liability coverage 
if a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance or an enforceable or recoverable indemnity from a customer  it could adversely affect our consolidated statement of financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the amount of our insurance may be less than the related impact on enterprise value after a loss 
our insurance coverage will not in all situations provide sufficient funds to protect us from all liabilities that could result from our drilling operations 
our coverage includes annual aggregate policy limits 
as a result  we generally retain the risk for any losses in excess of these limits 
we generally do not carry insurance for loss of revenue unless contractually required  and certain other claims may also not be reimbursed by insurance carriers 
any such lack of reimbursement may cause us to incur substantial costs 
in addition  we have decided to generally retain the risk associated with our standard jackup and barge fleets and we could decide to retain substantially more risk in the future 
moreover  no assurance can be made that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable or be able to obtain insurance against certain risks 
regulation of greenhouse gases and climate change could have a negative impact on our business 
some scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases  commonly referred to as greenhouse gases ghgs and including carbon dioxide and methane  may be contributing to warming of the earth s atmosphere and other climatic changes 
in response to such studies  the issue of climate change and the effect of ghg emissions  in particular emissions from fossil fuels  is attracting increasing attention worldwide 
legislation to regulate emissions of ghgs has been introduced in the us congress  and there has been a wide ranging policy debate  both in the us and internationally  regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation 
some of the proposals would require industries to meet stringent new standards that would require substantial reductions in carbon emissions 
those reductions could be costly and difficult to implement 
in addition  efforts have been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues  such as the united nations climate change conference in copenhagen in also  the us environmental protection agency epa has undertaken new efforts to collect information regarding ghg emissions and their effects 
following a finding by the epa that certain ghgs represent an endangerment to human health  epa finalized motor vehicle ghg standards  the effect of which could reduce demand for motor fuels refined from crude oil  and a final rule to address permitting of ghg emissions from stationary sources under the clean air act s prevention of significant deterioration and title v programs 
additionally  epa has issued a mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases final rule  which establishes a new comprehensive scheme requiring operators of stationary sources in the us emitting more than established annual thresholds of carbon dioxide equivalent ghgs to inventory and report their ghg emissions annually 
in late  epa finalized new ghg reporting requirements for upstream petroleum and natural gas systems  which will be added to epa s ghg reporting rule  and will require facilities containing petroleum and natural gas systems that emit  metric tons or more of co equivalent per year to report annual ghg emissions  with the first report due on march  because our business depends on the level of activity in the offshore oil and gas industry  existing or future laws  regulations  treaties or international agreements related to ghgs and climate change  including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources  could have a negative impact on our business if such laws  regulations  treaties or international agreements reduce the worldwide demand for oil and gas 
in addition  such laws  regulations  treaties or international agreements could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions  which may have a negative impact on our business 
failure to retain key personnel could hurt our operations 
we require highly skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services and support for our business worldwide 
historically  competition for the labor required for drilling operations  including for turnkey drilling and drilling management services businesses and construction projects  has intensified as the number of rigs activated  added to worldwide fleets or under construction increased  leading to shortages of qualified personnel in the industry and creating upward pressure on wages and higher turnover 
we may experience a reduction in the experience level of our personnel as a result of any increased turnover  which could lead to higher downtime and more operating incidents  which in turn could decrease revenues and increase costs 
if increased competition for labor were to intensify in the future we may experience increases in costs or limits on operations 
we are subject to litigation that  if not resolved in our favor and not sufficiently insured against  could have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition to the litigation surrounding the macondo well incident and the frade field incident  we are subject to a variety of other litigation 
certain of our subsidiaries are named as defendants in numerous lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos or toxic fumes or resulting from other occupational diseases  such as silicosis  and various other medical issues that can remain undiscovered for a considerable amount of time 
some of these subsidiaries that have been put on notice of potential liabilities have no assets 
further  our patent for dual activity technology has been challenged  and we have been accused of infringing other patents 
other subsidiaries are subject to litigation relating to environmental damage 
we cannot predict the outcome of the cases involving those subsidiaries or the potential costs to resolve them 
insurance may not be applicable or sufficient in all cases  insurers may not remain solvent  and policies may not be located  and liabilities associated to the macondo well incident may exhaust some or all of the insurance available to cover certain claims 
suits against non asset owning subsidiaries have and may in the future give rise to alter ego or successor in interest claims against us and our asset owning subsidiaries to the extent a subsidiary is unable to pay a claim or insurance is not available or sufficient to cover the claims 
we are also subject to a number of significant tax disputes 
to the extent that one or more pending or future litigation matters is not resolved in our favor and is not covered by insurance  a material adverse effect on our financial results and condition could result 
public health threats could have a material adverse effect on our operations and our financial results 
public health threats  such as the hn flu virus  severe acute respiratory syndrome  and other highly communicable diseases  outbreaks of which have already occurred in various parts of the world in which we operate  could adversely impact our operations  the operations of our customers and the global economy  including the worldwide demand for oil and natural gas and the level of demand for our services 
any quarantine of personnel or inability to access our offices or rigs could adversely affect our operations 
travel restrictions or operational problems in any part of the world in which we operate  or any reduction in the demand for drilling services caused by public health threats in the future  may materially impact operations and adversely affect our financial results 
acts of terrorism and social unrest could affect the markets for drilling services 
acts of terrorism and social unrest  brought about by world political events or otherwise  have caused instability in the world s financial and insurance markets in the past and may occur in the future 
such acts could be directed against companies such as ours 
in addition  acts of terrorism and social unrest could lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil and natural gas and could affect the markets for drilling services 
insurance premiums could increase and coverages may be unavailable in the future 
us government regulations may effectively preclude us from actively engaging in business activities in certain countries 
these regulations could be amended to cover countries where we currently operate or where we may wish to operate in the future 
we are protected to some extent against loss of capital assets  but generally not loss of revenue  from most of these risks through indemnity provisions in our drilling contracts 
our assets  however  are generally not insured against risk of loss due to perils such as terrorist acts  civil unrest  expropriation  nationalization and acts of war 
other risks we have significant carrying amounts of goodwill and long lived assets that are subject to impairment testing 
at december   the carrying amount of our property and equipment was billion  representing percent of our total assets  and the carrying amount of our goodwill was billion  representing nine percent of our total assets 
in accordance with our critical accounting policies  we review our property and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts of our assets held and used may not be recoverable  and we conduct impairment testing for our goodwill when events and circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit may have fallen below its carrying amount 
as of october   we recognized an estimated loss of billion on the impairment of goodwill associated with our contract drilling services reporting unit due to a decline in projected cash flows and market valuations for this reporting unit 
in the fourth quarter of  we recognized a loss of billion on the impairment of our standard jackup asset group due to projected declines in dayrates and utilization  and we have previously recognized other losses on impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
continued or future expectations of low dayrates and utilization could result in the recognition of additional losses on impairment of our long lived asset groups  particularly with respect to our high specification jackups  or our goodwill or other intangible assets if future cash flow expectations  based upon information available to management at the time of measurement  indicate that the carrying amount of our asset groups  goodwill or other intangible assets may be impaired 
a change in tax laws  treaties or regulations  or their interpretation  of any country in which we have operations  are incorporated or are resident could result in a higher tax rate on our worldwide earnings  which could result in a significant negative impact on our earnings and cash flows from operations 
we operate worldwide through our various subsidiaries 
consequently  we are subject to changes in applicable tax laws  treaties or regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate  which could include laws or policies directed toward companies organized in jurisdictions with low tax rates 
a material change in the tax laws or policies  or their interpretation  of any country in which we have significant operations  or in which we are incorporated or resident  could result in a higher effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings and such change could be significant to our financial results 
tax legislative proposals intending to eliminate some perceived tax advantages of companies that have legal domiciles outside the us  but have certain us connections  have repeatedly been introduced in the us congress 
recent examples include  but are not limited to  legislative proposals that would broaden the circumstances in which a non us company would be considered a non us resident  including the use of management and control provisions to determine corporate residency  and proposals that could override certain tax treaties and limit treaty benefits on certain payments by us subsidiaries to non us affiliates 
additionally  the non us congress has recently introduced a proposal which would disallow any deduction for otherwise tax deductible payments relating to any incident resulting in the discharge of oil into navigable waters  such as the macondo well incident 
any material change in tax laws or policies  or their interpretation  resulting from such legislative proposals or inquiries could result in a higher effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings and such change could have a material adverse effect on our statement of financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
a loss of a major tax dispute or a successful tax challenge to our operating structure  intercompany pricing policies or the taxable presence of our key subsidiaries in certain countries could result in a higher tax rate on our worldwide earnings  which could result in a significant negative impact on our earnings and cash flows from operations 
we are a swiss corporation that operates through our various subsidiaries in a number of countries throughout the world 
consequently  we are subject to tax laws  treaties and regulations in and between the countries in which we operate 
our income taxes are based upon the applicable tax laws and tax rates in effect in the countries in which we operate and earn income as well as upon our operating structures in these countries 
our income tax returns are subject to review and examination 
we do not recognize the benefit of income tax positions we believe are more likely than not to be disallowed upon challenge by a tax authority 
if any tax authority successfully challenges our operational structure  intercompany pricing policies or the taxable presence of our key subsidiaries in certain countries  or if the terms of certain income tax treaties are interpreted in a manner that is adverse to our structure  or if we lose a material tax dispute in any country  particularly in the us  norway or brazil  our effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings could increase substantially and our earnings and cash flows from operations could be materially adversely affected 
for example  there is considerable uncertainty as to the activities that constitute being engaged in a trade or business within the us or maintaining a permanent establishment under an applicable treaty  so we cannot be certain that the internal revenue service irs will not contend successfully that we or any of our key subsidiaries were or are engaged in a trade or business in the us or  when applicable  maintained or maintains a permanent establishment in the us if we or any of our key subsidiaries were considered to have been engaged in a trade or business in the us when applicable  through a permanent establishment  we could be subject to us corporate income and additional branch profits taxes on the portion of our earnings effectively connected to such us business during the period in which this was considered to have occurred  in which case our effective tax rate on worldwide earnings for that period could increase substantially  and our earnings and cash flows from operations for that period could be adversely affected 
the norwegian authorities have issued criminal indictments against two of our subsidiaries alleging misleading or incomplete disclosures in norwegian tax returns for the years of through  as well as civil actions based upon inaccuracies in norwegian statutory financial statements for the periods of through we cannot be certain that the norwegian authorities will not be successful in proving their allegations in a norwegian court of law 
if they are successful  our earnings and cash flows from operations could be adversely affected 
us tax authorities could treat us as a passive foreign investment company  which could have adverse us federal income tax consequences to us holders 
a foreign corporation will be treated as a passive foreign investment company  or pfic  for us federal income tax purposes if either at least percent of its gross income for any taxable year consists of certain types of passive income or at least percent of the average value of the corporation s assets produce or are held for the production of those types of passive income 
for purposes of these tests  passive income includes dividends  interest and gains from the sale or exchange of investment property and certain rents and royalties  but does not include income derived from the performance of services 
we believe that we have not been and will not be a pfic with respect to any taxable year 
our income from offshore contract drilling services should be treated as services income for purposes of determining whether we are a pfic 
accordingly  we believe that our income from our offshore contract drilling services should not constitute passive income  and the assets that we own and operate in connection with the production of that income should not constitute passive assets 
there is significant legal authority supporting this position  including statutory provisions  legislative history  case law and irs pronouncements concerning the characterization  for other tax purposes  of income derived from services where a substantial component of such income is attributable to the value of the property or equipment used in connection with providing such services 
it should be noted  however  that a recent case and an irs pronouncement which relies on the recent case characterize income from time chartering of vessels as rental income rather than services income for other tax purposes 
however  the irs subsequently has formally announced that it does not agree with the decision in that case 
moreover  we believe that the terms of the time charters in the recent case differ in material respects from the terms of our drilling contracts with customers 
no assurance can be given that the irs or a court will accept our position  and there is a risk that the irs or a court could determine that we are a pfic 
if we were to be treated as a pfic for any taxable year  our us shareholders would face adverse us tax consequences 
under the pfic rules  unless a shareholder makes certain elections available under the internal revenue code of  as amended which elections could themselves have adverse consequences for such shareholder  such shareholder would be liable to pay us federal income tax at the highest applicable income tax rates on ordinary income upon the receipt of excess distributions as defined for us tax purposes and upon any gain from the disposition of our shares  plus interest on such amounts  as if such excess distribution or gain had been recognized ratably over the shareholder s holding period of our shares 
in addition  under applicable statutory provisions  the preferential percent tax rate on qualified dividend income  which applies to dividends paid to non corporate shareholders prior to  does not apply to dividends paid by a foreign corporation if the foreign corporation is a pfic for the taxable year in which the dividend is paid or the preceding taxable year 
we may be limited in our use of net operating losses 
our ability to benefit from our deferred tax assets depends on us having sufficient future earnings to utilize our net operating loss nol carryforwards before they expire 
we have established a valuation allowance against the future tax benefit for a number of our non us nol carryforwards  and we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance against our non us or non us deferred tax assets if market conditions change materially and  as a result  our future earnings are  or are projected to be  significantly less than we currently estimate 
our nol carryforwards are subject to review and potential disallowance upon audit by the tax authorities of the jurisdictions where the nols are incurred 
our status as a swiss corporation may limit our flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management and may cause us to be unable to make distributions or repurchase shares without subjecting our shareholders to swiss withholding tax 
swiss law allows our shareholders to authorize share capital that can be issued by the board of directors without additional shareholder approval  but this authorization is limited to percent of the existing registered share capital and must be renewed by the shareholders every two years 
at the annual general meeting on may   our shareholders approved our current authorized share capital  which expires on may  and was limited to percent of our existing share capital 
in connection with our december issuance of shares  our available authorized share capital decreased to percent of our existing share capital 
additionally  subject to specified exceptions  swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares 
swiss law also does not provide as much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares as the laws of some other jurisdictions 
in the event we need to raise common equity capital at a time when the trading price of our shares is below the par value of the shares currently chf  equivalent to based on a foreign exchange rate of usd to chf on february   we will need to obtain approval of shareholders to decrease the par value of our shares or issue another class of shares with a lower par value 
any reduction in par value would decrease our par value available for future repayment of share capital not subject to swiss withholding tax 
swiss law also reserves for approval by shareholders certain corporate actions over which a board of directors would have authority in some other jurisdictions 
for example  dividends must be approved by shareholders 
these swiss law requirements relating to our capital management may limit our flexibility  and situations may arise where greater flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders 
distributions to shareholders in the form of a par value reduction and dividend distributions out of qualifying additional paid in capital are not currently subject to the percent swiss federal withholding tax 
dividend distributions out of qualifying additional paid in capital do not require registration with the commercial register of the canton of zug 
however  the swiss withholding tax rules could also be changed in the future 
due to the continuing debate in the swiss political arena  we cannot provide assurance that the current swiss law with respect to distributions out of additional paid in capital will not be changed or that a change in swiss law will not adversely affect us or our shareholders  in particular as a result of distributions out of additional paid in capital becoming subject to swiss federal withholding tax or subject to additional corporate law restrictions 
in addition  over the long term  the amount of par value available for us to use for par value reductions or the amount of qualifying additional paid in capital available for us to pay out as distributions is limited 
if we are unable to make a distribution through a reduction in par value  or out of qualifying additional paid in capital as shown on transocean ltd 
s standalone swiss statutory financial statements  we may not be able to make distributions without subjecting our shareholders to swiss withholding taxes 
under present swiss tax law  repurchases of shares for the purposes of capital reduction are treated as a partial liquidation subject to a percent swiss withholding tax on the repurchase price less the par value  and since january   to the extent attributable to qualifying additional paid in capital  if any 
at our annual general meeting  our shareholders approved the repurchase of up to chf billion of our shares for cancellation the share repurchase program 
on february   our board of directors authorized our management to implement the share repurchase program 
we may repurchase shares under the share repurchase program via a second trading line on the six from institutional investors who are generally able to receive a full refund of the swiss withholding tax 
alternatively  in relation to the us market  we may repurchase shares under the share repurchase program using an alternative procedure pursuant to which we can repurchase shares under the share repurchase program via a virtual second trading line from market players in particular  banks and institutional investors who are generally entitled to receive a full refund of the swiss withholding tax 
there may not be sufficient liquidity in our shares on the six to repurchase the amount of shares that we would like to repurchase using the second trading line on the six 
in addition  our ability to use the virtual second trading line is limited to the share repurchase program currently approved by our shareholders  and any use of the virtual second trading line with respect to future share repurchase programs will require the approval of the competent swiss tax and other authorities 
we may not be able to repurchase as many shares as we would like to repurchase for purposes of capital reduction on either the virtual second trading line or  in the future  a six second trading line without subjecting the selling shareholders to swiss withholding taxes 
we are subject to anti takeover provisions 
our articles of association and swiss law contain provisions that could prevent or delay an acquisition of the company by means of a tender offer  a proxy contest or otherwise 
these provisions may also adversely affect prevailing market prices for our shares 
these provisions  among other things classify our board into three classes of directors  each of which serve for staggered three year periods  provide that the board of directors is authorized  subject to obtaining shareholder approval every two years  at any time during a maximum two year period  which is currently scheduled to expire on may   to issue up to a specified number of shares  currently approximately percent of the share capital registered in the commercial register  and to limit or withdraw the preemptive rights of existing shareholders in various circumstances  including following a shareholder or group of shareholders acting in concert having acquired in excess of percent of the share capital registered in the commercial register without having submitted a takeover proposal to shareholders that is recommended by the board of directors or for purposes of the defense of an actual  threatened or potential unsolicited takeover bid  in relation to which the board of directors has  upon consultation with an independent financial adviser retained by the board of directors  not recommended acceptance to the shareholders  provide for a conditional share capital that authorizes the issuance of additional shares up to a maximum amount of percent of the share capital registered in the commercial register without obtaining additional shareholder approval through the exercise of conversion  exchange  option  warrant or similar rights for the subscription of shares granted in connection with bonds  options  warrants or other securities newly or already issued in national or international capital markets or new or already existing contractual obligations by or of any of our subsidiaries  or in connection with the issuance of shares  options or other share based awards  provide that any shareholder who wishes to propose any business or to nominate a person or persons for election as director at any annual meeting may only do so if advance notice is given to the company  provide that directors can be removed from office only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least percent of the shares entitled to vote  provide that a merger or demerger transaction requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least percent of the shares represented at the meeting and provide for the possibility of a so called cashout or squeezeout merger if the acquirer controls percent of the outstanding shares entitled to vote at the meeting  provide that any action required or permitted to be taken by the holders of shares must be taken at a duly called annual or extraordinary general meeting of shareholders  limit the ability of our shareholders to amend or repeal some provisions of our articles of association  and limit transactions between us and an interested shareholder  which is generally defined as a shareholder that  together with its affiliates and associates  beneficially  directly or indirectly  owns percent or more of our shares entitled to vote at a general meeting

item legal proceedings macondo well incident overview on april   the ultra deepwater floater deepwater horizon sank after a blowout of the macondo well caused a fire and explosion on the rig 
eleven persons were declared dead and others were injured as a result of the incident 
at the time of the explosion  deepwater horizon was located approximately miles off the coast of louisiana in mississippi canyon block and was contracted to bp america production co 
the mdl court has issued an order outlining the trial plan  which will proceed in three phases 
the first phase will focus on issues arising out of the conduct of various parties  relevant to the loss of well control at the macondo well  the ensuing fire and explosion on deepwater horizon on april   the sinking of deepwater horizon on april   and the initiation of the release of oil during those time periods 
the second phase will address conduct relating to stopping the release of hydrocarbons between april  and approximately september   and seek to determine the amount of oil actually released during that time period 
the third  and final  phase will involve consideration of issues relating to containing oil discharged by controlled burning  application of dispersants  use of booms  skimming and other methods  as well as issues pertaining to the migration paths and end locations of oil released 
trial is currently scheduled to commence on march  there can be no assurance as to the outcome of the trial  that the trial will proceed according to the proposed schedule  that we will not enter into a settlement as to some or all of the matters related to the macondo well incident  including those to be determined at the trial  or as to the timing or terms of any such settlement 
we are currently unable to estimate the full impact the macondo well incident will have on us 
we have recognized a liability for estimated loss contingencies that we believe are probable and for which a reasonable estimate can be made 
as of december   we have recognized a liability for such loss contingencies in the amount of billion 
this liability takes into account certain events related to the litigation and investigations arising out of the incident 
there are loss contingencies related to the macondo well incident that we believe are reasonably possible and for which we do not believe a reasonable estimate can be made 
these contingencies could increase the liabilities we ultimately recognize 
as of december   we have also recognized an asset of million associated with the portion of our estimated losses that we believe is recoverable from insurance 
although we have available policy limits that could result in additional amounts recoverable from insurance  we are not currently able to estimate the amount of such additional recoverable amounts 
our estimates involve a significant amount of judgment 
as a result of new information or future developments  some of which could occur very soon  we may adjust our estimated loss contingencies arising out of the macondo well incident  and the resulting liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position  results of operations and cash flows

wrongful death and personal injury as of december   we and one or more of our subsidiaries have been named  along with other unaffiliated defendants  in complaints that were pending in state and federal courts in louisiana and texas involving multiple plaintiffs that allege wrongful death and other personal injuries arising out of the macondo well incident 
per the order of the multi district litigation panel the mdl  these claims have been centralized for discovery purposes in the mdl court 
the complaints generally allege  among other things  negligence and seek awards of unspecified economic damages and punitive damages 
bp  mi swaco  weatherford ltd

the complaints generally allege  among other things  economic losses as a result of environmental pollution arising out of the macondo well incident and are based primarily on opa and state opa analogues 
certain claims were dismissed in a court ruling on august  see environmental matters 
the plaintiffs are generally seeking awards of unspecified economic  compensatory and punitive damages  as well as injunctive relief

federal securities claims two federal securities law class actions are currently pending in the us district court  southern district of new york  naming us and certain of our officers and directors as defendants 
one of these actions generally allege violations of section b of the securities exchange act of the exchange act  rule b promulgated under the exchange act and section a of the exchange act in connection with the macondo well incident 
the plaintiffs are generally seeking awards of unspecified economic damages  including damages resulting from the decline in our stock price after the macondo well incident 
the other action was filed by a former globalsantafe corporation globalsantafe shareholder  alleging that the proxy statement related to our shareholder meeting in connection with our merger with globalsantafe violated section a of the exchange act  rule a promulgated thereunder and section a of the exchange act 
the plaintiff claims that globalsantafe shareholders received inadequate consideration for their shares as a result of the alleged violations and seeks rescission and compensatory damages 
the defendants have filed motions to dismiss each of these claims  and the plaintiffs have responded 
the motions have been fully briefed and are pending rulings by the courts 
shareholder derivative claims in june  two shareholder derivative suits were filed by our shareholders naming us as a nominal defendant and certain of our officers and directors as defendants in the district courts of the state of texas 
the first case generally alleges breach of fiduciary duty  unjust enrichment  abuse of control  gross mismanagement and waste of corporate assets in connection with the macondo well incident and the other generally alleges breach of fiduciary duty  unjust enrichment and waste of corporate assets in connection with the macondo well incident 
the plaintiffs are generally seeking  on behalf of us  restitution and disgorgement of all profits  benefits and other compensation from the defendants 
under current schedule orders  an amended consolidated complaint must be filed by the plaintiffs by march  limitation of liability action at the instruction of our insurers and to preserve our insurance coverage  pursuant to the federal limitation of a shipowner s liability act the limitation act  we filed a complaint in the houston division of the southern district of texas on may  regarding the casualty of the deepwater horizon rig 
the action has been transferred to the us district court  eastern district of louisiana for further proceedings 
under the limitation act  a vessel owner is generally liable only for the post accident value of the vessel and cargo as long as the vessel owner can show that it had no knowledge of or privity of knowledge with entities that were negligent 
claims limited under the limitation act include personal injury  wrongful death  and damage to property contained on the rig 
pursuant to the limitation act  we are seeking an injunction staying certain lawsuits underway in jurisdictions other than the eastern district of louisiana 
in addition  we are seeking to limit our liability for personal injury  wrongful death and damage to property contained on the rig to million  the value of the rig and its freight  including the accounts receivable and accrued accounts receivable  as of april  one objective of the filing is to consolidate lawsuits relating to the deepwater horizon casualty and to process these lawsuits and claims in an orderly fashion  before a single federal judge 
the filing also seeks to establish a single fund from which legitimate claims may be paid 
environmental matters environmental claims under two different schemes  statutory and common law  and in two different regimes  federal and state  have been asserted against us 
see litigation economic loss 
liability under many statutes is imposed without fault  but such statutes often allow the amount of damages to be limited 
in contrast  common law liability requires proof of fault and causation  but generally has no readily defined limitation on damages  other than the type of damages that may be redressed 
we have described below certain significant applicable environmental statutes and matters relating to the macondo well incident 
opa imposes strict liability on responsible parties of vessels or facilities from which oil is discharged into or upon navigable waters or adjoining shore lines 
opa defines the responsible parties with respect to the source of discharge 
responsible parties for discharges are liable for removal and cleanup costs  damages that result from the discharge  including natural resources damages  generally up to a statutorily defined limit  reimbursement for government efforts and certain other specified damages 
for responsible parties of modus  the limitation on liability is determined based on the gross tonnage of the vessel 
the statutory limits are not applicable  however  if the discharge is the result of gross negligence  willful misconduct  or violation of federal construction or permitting regulations by the responsible party or a party in a contractual relationship with the responsible party 
the national pollution funds center npfc  a division of the us coast guard  is charged with administering the oil spill liability trust fund osltf 
the npfc collects fines and civil penalties under opa from responsible parties  as defined in the statute 
the payments are directed to the osltf 
to date  the npfc has issued twelve invoices to bp  anadarko petroleum corporation together with its affiliates  anadarko and moex offshore llc together with its affiliates  moex  as the operator and leasehold owners of the well and  thus  the statutorily defined responsible parties for discharges from the well and wellhead 
to date  bp has paid eleven of the twelve invoices 
invoices have also been sent to us  and we have acknowledged responsible party status only with respect to discharges from the vessel on or above the surface of the water  if any 
on december   the doj filed a civil lawsuit against us and other unaffiliated defendants 
the complaint alleges claims under opa and the clean water act  including claims for per barrel civil penalties of up to  per barrel  or up to  per barrel if gross negligence or willful misconduct is established 
the us government has estimated that up to million barrels of oil were discharged and subject to penalties 
the doj reserved its rights to amend the complaint to add new claims and defendants 
the complaint asserts that all defendants named are jointly and severally liable for all removal costs and damages resulting from the macondo well incident 
on december   the doj filed a motion for partial summary judgment seeking a ruling that we were jointly and severally liable under opa  and liable for civil penalties under the clean water act  for all of the discharges from the macondo well on the theory that the discharges not only came from the well  but also came from the blowout preventer and riser  appurtenances of deepwater horizon 
we believe that the owner or operator of a mobile offshore drilling unit modu  such as deepwater horizon  is only a responsible party with respect to discharges from the vessel that occur on or above the surface of the water 
as the responsible party for deepwater horizon  we believe we are responsible only for the discharges of oil emanating from the rig above the surface of the water 
therefore  we believe we are not responsible for the discharged hydrocarbons from the macondo well 
on january   we filed our opposition to the motion and filed a cross motion for partial summary judgment seeking a ruling that we are not liable or the subsurface discharge of hydrocarbons 
on february   the mdl court ruled that we are not liable as a responsible party for damages under opa with respect to the below surface discharges from the macondo well 
the court also ruled that the below surface discharge was discharged from the well facility  and not from the deepwater horizon vessel  within the meaning of the clean water act  and that we therefore are not liable for such discharges as an owner of the vessel under the clean water act 
however  the court ruled that the issue of whether we could be held liable for such discharge under the clean water act as an operator of the well facility could not be resolved on summary judgment 
the court did not determine whether we could be liable for removal costs under opa  or the extent of such removal costs 
in addition to the civil complaint  the doj served us with civil investigative demands cids on december  these demands were part of an investigation by the doj to determine if we made false claims  or false statements in support of claims  in connection with the operator s acquisition of the leasehold interest in the mississippi canyon block  gulf of mexico and the drilling operations on deepwater horizon 
the doj is also conducting a criminal investigation of the macondo well incident 
other investigations are pending or have been concluded in connection with the incident 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contingencies macondo well incident 
we have also received claims directly from individuals  pursuant to opa  requesting compensation for loss of income as a result of the macondo well incident 
bp has accepted responsible party status with the us coast guard for the release of hydrocarbons from the macondo well and has stated its intent to pay all legitimate claims  and we have not paid any of these claims 
other federal statutes several of the claimants have made assertions under other statutes  including the clean water act  the endangered species act  the migratory bird treaty act  the clean air act  the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and the emergency planning and community right to know act 
state environmental laws as of december   claims had been asserted by private claimants under state environmental statutes in florida  louisiana  mississippi and texas 
as described below  claims asserted by various state and local governments are pending in alabama  florida  louisiana and texas 
in june  the louisiana department of environmental quality the ldeq issued a consolidated compliance order and notice of potential penalty to us and certain of our subsidiaries asking us to eliminate and remediate discharges of oil and other pollutants into waters and property located in the state of louisiana  and to submit a plan and report in response to the order 
we requested that the ldeq rescind the enforcement actions against us and our subsidiaries because the remediation actions that are the subject of such orders are actions that do not involve us or our subsidiaries  as we are not involved in the remediation or clean up activities 
alternatively  if the ldeq would not rescind the enforcement actions altogether  we requested the ldeq to dismiss the enforcement actions against us and certain of our subsidiaries as these entities are not proper parties to the enforcement actions and were improperly served 
in october  the ldeq rescinded its enforcement actions against us and our subsidiaries but reserved its rights to seek civil penalties for future violations of the louisiana environmental quality act 
in september  the state of louisiana filed a declaratory judgment seeking to designate us as a responsible party under opa and the louisiana oil spill prevention and response act lospra for the discharges emanating from the macondo well 
specifically the declaratory judgment claims that we are a responsible party under opa for all hydrocarbons discharged from the macondo well  including underwater discharges of oil from the well head  that we  as a responsible party  are jointly  severally  and strictly liable for the spill from the macondo well in accordance with opa  that we are a responsible party under the louisiana oil spill prevention and response act for all hydrocarbons discharged from the macondo well  including underwater discharges of oil from the well head  that we  as a responsible party  are jointly  severally  and strictly liable for the spill from the macondo well in accordance with the lospra  and seeks an award plaintiff s costs incurred in pursuing this action as allowed by law 
additionally  suits have been filed by the state of alabama and the cities of greenville  evergreen  georgiana and mckenzie  alabama in the us district court  middle district of alabama  the mexican states of veracruz  quintana roo and tamaulipas in the us district court  western district of texas  and the city of panama city beach  florida in the us district court  northern district of florida 
suits were also filed by the city of new orleans  by and on behalf of multiple parishes  and by or on behalf of the town of grand isle  grand isle independent levee district  the town of jean lafitte  the lafitte area independent levee district  the city of gretna  the city of westwego  and the city of harahan in the us district court  eastern district of louisiana 
additional suits were filed by or on behalf of other parishes in the respective parish courts and were removed to federal court 
a local government master complaint also was filed in which cities  municipalities  and other local government entities can and have joined 
generally  these governmental entities allege economic losses under opa and other statutory environmental state claims and also assert various common law state claims 
the claims have been centralized in the mdl court and will proceed in accordance with the mdl scheduling order  and the city of panama city beach s claim was voluntarily dismissed 
on august   the mdl court ruled on the motion to dismiss certain economic loss claims 
the court ruled that state law  both statutory and common law  is preempted by maritime law  notwithstanding opa s savings provisions 
accordingly  all claims brought under state law were dismissed 
secondly  general maritime law claims that do not allege physical damage to a proprietary interest were dismissed  unless the claim falls into the commercial fisherman exception 
the court ruled that opa claims for economic loss do not require physical damage to a proprietary interest 
third  the mdl court ruled that presentment under opa is a mandatory condition precedent to filing suit against a responsible party 
finally  the mdl court ruled that claims for punitive damages may be available under general maritime law in claims against responsible parties and non responsible parties 
the state of louisiana and bp each have appealed portions of this ruling 
the mexican states opa claims were dismissed for failure to demonstrate that recovery under opa was authorized by treaty or executive agreement 
this ruling may be appealed 
by letter dated may   the attorneys general of the five gulf coast states of alabama  florida  louisiana  mississippi and texas informed us that they intend to seek recovery of pollution clean up costs and related damages arising from the macondo well incident 
in addition  by letter dated june   the attorneys general of the atlantic coast states of connecticut  delaware  georgia  maine  maryland  massachusetts  new hampshire  new york  north carolina  rhode island and south carolina informed us that their states have not sustained any damage from the macondo well incident but they would like assurances that we will be responsible financially if damages are sustained 
we responded to each letter from the attorneys general and indicated that we intend to fulfill our obligations as a responsible party for any discharge of oil from deepwater horizon on or above the surface of the water  and we assume that the operator will similarly fulfill its obligations under opa for discharges from the undersea well 
other than the lawsuits filed by the states discussed above  no further requests have been made or actions taken subsequent to the initial communication 
wreck removal by letter dated december   the coast guard requested us to formulate and submit a comprehensive oil removal plan to remove any diesel fuel contained in the sponsons and fuel tanks that can be recovered from deepwater horizon 
we have conducted a survey of the rig wreckage and have confirmed that no diesel fuel remains on the rig 
we have insurance coverage for wreck removal for up to percent of deepwater horizon s insured value  or million  with any excess wreck removal liability generally covered to the extent of our remaining excess liability limits 
contractual indemnity under our drilling contract for deepwater horizon  the operator has agreed  among other things  to assume full responsibility for and defend  release and indemnify us from any loss  expense  claim  fine  penalty or liability for pollution or contamination  including control and removal thereof  arising out of or connected with operations under the contract other than for pollution or contamination originating on or above the surface of the water from hydrocarbons or other specified substances within the control and possession of the contractor  as to which we agreed to assume responsibility and protect  release and indemnify the operator 
although we do not believe it is applicable to the macondo well incident  we also agreed to indemnify and defend the operator up to a limit of million for claims for loss or damage to third parties arising from pollution caused by the rig while it is off the drilling location  while the rig is underway or during drive off or drift off of the rig from the drilling location 
the operator has also agreed  among other things  to defend  release and indemnify us against loss or damage to the reservoir  and loss of property rights to oil  gas and minerals below the surface of the earth and to defend  release and indemnify us and bear the cost of bringing the well under control in the event of a blowout or other loss of control 
we agreed to defend  release and indemnify the operator for personal injury and death of our employees  invitees and the employees of our subcontractors while the operator agreed to defend  release and indemnify us for personal injury and death of its employees  invitees and the employees of its subcontractors  other than us 
we have also agreed to defend  release and indemnify the operator for damages to the rig and equipment  including salvage or removal costs 
although we believe we are entitled to contractual defense and indemnity  given the potential amounts involved in connection with the macondo well incident  the operator has sought to avoid its indemnification obligations 
in particular  the operator  in response to our request for indemnification  has generally reserved all of its rights and stated that it could not at this time conclude that it is obligated to indemnify us 
in doing so  the operator has asserted that the facts are not sufficiently developed to determine who is responsible and has cited a variety of possible legal theories based upon the contract and facts still to be developed 
we believe this reservation of rights is without justification and that the operator is required to honor its indemnification obligations contained in our contract and described above 
in april  bp filed a claim seeking a declaration that it is not liable to us in contribution  indemnification  or otherwise 
on november   we filed a motion for partial summary judgment  seeking enforcement of the indemnity obligations for pollution and civil fines and penalties contained in the drilling contract with bp 
on january   the court ruled that the drilling contract requires bp to indemnify us for compensatory damages asserted by third parties against us related to pollution that did not originate on or above the surface of the water  even if the claim is the result of our strict liability  negligence  or gross negligence 
the court also held that bp does not owe us indemnity to the extent that we are held liable for civil penalties under the clean water act or for punitive damages 
the court deferred ruling on bp s argument that we breached the drilling contract or materially increased bp s risk or prejudiced its rights so as to vitiate bp s indemnity obligations 
our motion for partial summary judgment and the court s ruling did not address the issue of contractual indemnity for criminal fines and penalties 
the law generally considers contractual indemnity for criminal fines and penalties to be against public policy 
other legal proceedings brazil frade field incident on or about november   oil was released from fissures in the ocean floor in the vicinity of a development well being drilled by chevron off the coast of rio de janeiro in the frade field with sedco the release was ultimately controlled and the well was plugged 
the oil released is in the process of being contained by chevron 
on or about december   a federal prosecutor in the town of campos in rio de janeiro state filed a civil public action against chevron and us seeking billion brazilian reals  equivalent to approximately billion  and seeking a preliminary and permanent injunction preventing chevron and us from operating in brazil 
the prosecutor amended the requested injunction on december   to seek to prevent chevron and us from conducting extraction or transportation activities in brazil and to seek to require chevron to stop the release and remediate its effects 
the complaint has not been served on us 
on january   a judge of the federal court in campos issued an order finding that the case should be transferred to the federal court in rio de janeiro 
on december   a federal police marshal investigating the release filed a report with the federal court in rio de janeiro state recommending the indictment of chevron  us  and individuals  five of which are our employees 
the report recommended indictment on four counts  three alleging environmental offenses and one alleging false statements by chevron in connection with its cleanup efforts 
the federal court in rio de janeiro state has forwarded the report to the federal court in campos for a decision on the proper jurisdiction for the matter 
in addition  there is a risk that brazilian authorities could temporarily or permanently enjoin us from further operations in brazil 
the drilling services and charter contracts between us and chevron provides  among other things  for chevron to indemnify and defend us for claims based on pollution or contamination originating from below the surface of the water  including claims for control or removal or property loss or damage  including but not limited to third party claims and liabilities  with an excludable amount of  per occurrence if the claim arises from our negligence 
we believe that we have valid defenses to the threatened civil and criminal claims by the federal prosecutor and intend to defend vigorously against any claims that are brought based on the incident 
we also intend to pursue indemnity rights under our contracts with chevron 
asbestos litigation in  several of our subsidiaries were named  along with numerous other unaffiliated defendants  in complaints filed on behalf of plaintiffs in the circuit courts of the state of mississippi and which claimed injuries arising out of exposure to asbestos allegedly contained in drilling mud during these plaintiffs employment in drilling activities between and each individual plaintiff was subsequently required to file a separate lawsuit  and the original multi plaintiff complaints were then dismissed by the circuit courts 
the amended complaints resulted in one of our subsidiaries being named as a direct defendant in seven cases 
we have or may have an indirect interest in an additional cases 
the complaints generally allege that the defendants used or manufactured asbestos containing drilling mud additives for use in connection with drilling operations and have included allegations of negligence  products liability  strict liability and claims allowed under the jones act and general maritime law 
the plaintiffs generally seek awards of unspecified compensatory and punitive damages 
in each of these cases  the complaints have named other unaffiliated defendant companies  including companies that allegedly manufactured the drilling related products that contained asbestos 
all of these cases are being governed for discovery and trial setting by a single case management order entered by a special master appointed by the court to reside over all the cases  and none of the seven cases in which we are a named defendant have been scheduled for trial or pre trial discovery 
the preliminary information available on these claims is not sufficient to determine if there is an identifiable period for alleged exposure to asbestos  whether any asbestos exposure in fact occurred  the vessels potentially involved in the claims  or the basis on which the plaintiffs would support claims that their injuries were related to exposure to asbestos 
however  the initial evidence available would suggest that we would have significant defenses to liability and damages 
we intend to defend these lawsuits vigorously  although there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome 
we historically have maintained broad liability insurance  although we are not certain whether insurance will cover the liabilities  if any  arising out of these claims 
based on our evaluation of the exposure to date  we do not expect the liability  if any  resulting from these claims to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
one of our subsidiaries was involved in lawsuits arising out of the subsidiary s involvement in the design  construction and refurbishment of major industrial complexes 
the operating assets of the subsidiary were sold and its operations discontinued in  and the subsidiary has no remaining assets other than the insurance policies involved in its litigation  with its insurers and  either directly or indirectly as the beneficiary of a qualified settlement fund  funding from settlements with insurers  assigned rights from insurers and coverage in place settlement agreements with insurers  and funds received from the communication of certain insurance policies 
the subsidiary has been named as a defendant  along with numerous other companies  in lawsuits alleging bodily injury or personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos 
as of december   the subsidiary was a defendant in approximately lawsuits 
some of these lawsuits include multiple plaintiffs and we estimate that there are approximately  plaintiffs in these lawsuits 
for many of these lawsuits  we have not been provided with sufficient information from the plaintiffs to determine whether all or some of the plaintiffs have claims against the subsidiary  the basis of any such claims  or the nature of their alleged injuries 
the first of the asbestos related lawsuits was filed against this subsidiary in through december   the amounts expended to resolve claims  including both defense fees and expenses and settlement costs  have not been material  all known deductibles have been satisfied or are inapplicable  and the subsidiary s defense fees and expenses and costs of settlement have been met by insurance made available to the subsidiary 
the subsidiary continues to be named as a defendant in additional lawsuits  and we cannot predict the number of additional cases in which it may be named a defendant nor can we predict the potential costs to resolve such additional cases or to resolve the pending cases 
however  the subsidiary has in excess of billion in insurance limits potentially available to the subsidiary 
although not all of the policies may be fully available due to the insolvency of certain insurers  we believe that the subsidiary will have sufficient funding from settlements and claims payments from insurers  assigned rights from insurers and coverage in place settlement agreements with insurers to respond to these claims 
while we cannot predict or provide assurance as to the final outcome of these matters  we do not believe that the current value of the claims where we have been identified will have a material impact on our consolidated statement of financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
rio de janeiro tax assessment in the third quarter of  we received tax assessments of approximately million from the state tax authorities of rio de janeiro in brazil against one of our brazilian subsidiaries for taxes on equipment imported into the state in connection with our operations 
the assessments resulted from a preliminary finding by these authorities that our subsidiary s record keeping practices were deficient 
we currently believe that the substantial majority of these assessments are without merit 
we filed an initial response with the rio de janeiro tax authorities on september  refuting these additional tax assessments 
in september  we received confirmation from the state tax authorities that they believe the additional tax assessments are valid  and as a result  we filed an appeal on september  to the state taxpayer s council contesting these assessments 
while we cannot predict or provide assurance as to the final outcome of these proceedings  we do not expect it to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
brazilian import license assessment in the fourth quarter of  one of our brazilian subsidiaries received an assessment from the brazilian federal tax authorities in rio de janeiro of approximately million based upon the alleged failure to timely apply for import licenses for certain equipment and for allegedly providing improper information on import license applications 
we responded to the assessment on december   and we currently believe that a substantial majority of the assessment is without merit 
while we cannot predict or provide assurance as to the final outcome of these proceedings  we do not expect it to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
other matters we are involved in various tax matters and various regulatory matters 
we are also involved in lawsuits relating to damage claims arising out of hurricanes katrina and rita  all of which are insured and which are not material to us 
in addition  as of december   we were involved in a number of other lawsuits  including a dispute for municipal tax payments in brazil and a dispute involving customs procedures in india  neither of which is material to us  and all of which have arisen in the ordinary course of our business 
we do not expect the liability  if any  resulting from these other matters to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we cannot predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any of the litigation matters specifically described above or of any such other pending or threatened litigation 
there can be no assurance that our beliefs or expectations as to the outcome or effect of any lawsuit or other litigation matter will prove correct and the eventual outcome of these matters could materially differ from management s current estimates 
other environmental matters hazardous waste disposal sites we have certain potential liabilities under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla and similar state acts regulating cleanup of various hazardous waste disposal sites  including those described below 
cercla is intended to expedite the remediation of hazardous substances without regard to fault 
potentially responsible parties prps for each site include present and former owners and operators of  transporters to and generators of the substances at the site 
liability is strict and can be joint and several 
we have been named as a prp in connection with a site located in santa fe springs  california  known as the waste disposal  inc site 
we and other prps have agreed with the us environmental protection agency epa and the doj to settle our potential liabilities for this site by agreeing to perform the remaining remediation required by the epa 
the form of the agreement is a consent decree  which has been entered by the court 
the parties to the settlement have entered into a participation agreement  which makes us liable for approximately eight percent of the remediation and related costs 
the remediation is complete  and we believe our share of the future operation and maintenance costs of the site is not material 
there are additional potential liabilities related to the site  but these cannot be quantified  and we have no reason at this time to believe that they will be material 
one of our subsidiaries has been ordered by the california regional water quality control board crwqcb to develop a testing plan for a site known as campus fremont in alhambra  california 
this site was formerly owned and operated by certain of our subsidiaries 
it is presently owned by an unrelated party  which has received an order to test the property 
we have also been advised that one or more of our subsidiaries is likely to be named by the epa as a prp for the san gabriel valley  area  superfund site  which includes this property 
testing has been completed at the property but no contaminants of concern were detected 
in discussions with crwqcb staff  we were advised of their intent to issue us a no further action letter but it has not yet been received 
based on the test results  we would contest any potential liability 
we have no knowledge at this time of the potential cost of any remediation  who else will be named as prps  and whether in fact any of our subsidiaries is a responsible party 
the subsidiaries in question do not own any operating assets and have limited ability to respond to any liabilities 
resolutions of other claims by the epa  the involved state agency or prps are at various stages of investigation 
these investigations involve determinations of the actual responsibility attributed to us and the other prps at the site  appropriate investigatory or remedial actions  and allocation of the costs of such activities among the prps and other site users 
our ultimate financial responsibility in connection with those sites may depend on many factors  including the volume and nature of material  if any  contributed to the site for which we are responsible  the number of other prps and their financial viability  and the remediation methods and technology to be used 
it is difficult to quantify with certainty the potential cost of these environmental matters  particularly in respect of remediation obligations 
nevertheless  based upon the information currently available  we believe that our ultimate liability arising from all environmental matters  including the liability for all other related pending legal proceedings  asserted legal claims and known potential legal claims which are likely to be asserted  is adequately accrued and should not have a material effect on our statement of financial position  or results of operations 
estimated costs of future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are not discounted to their present value 
contamination litigation on july   one of our subsidiaries was served with a lawsuit filed on behalf of three landowners in louisiana in the th judicial district court for the parish of avoyelles  state of louisiana 
the lawsuit named other defendants  all of which were alleged to have contaminated the plaintiffs property with naturally occurring radioactive material  produced water  drilling fluids  chlorides  hydrocarbons  heavy metals and other contaminants as a result of oil and gas exploration activities 
experts retained by the plaintiffs issued a report suggesting significant contamination in the area operated by the subsidiary and another codefendant  and claimed that over million would be required to properly remediate the contamination 
the experts retained by the defendants conducted their own investigation and concluded that the remediation costs would amount to no more than million 
the plaintiffs and the codefendant threatened to add globalsantafe as a defendant in the lawsuit under the single business enterprise doctrine contained in louisiana law 
the single business enterprise doctrine is similar to corporate veil piercing doctrines 
on august   our subsidiary and its immediate parent company  each of which is an entity that no longer conducts operations or holds assets  filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter of the us bankruptcy code in the us bankruptcy court for the district of delaware 
later that day  the plaintiffs dismissed our subsidiary from the lawsuit 
subsequently  the codefendant filed various motions in the lawsuit and in the delaware bankruptcies attempting to assert alter ego and single business enterprise claims against globalsantafe and two other subsidiaries in the lawsuit 
the efforts to assert alter ego and single business enterprise theory claims against globalsantafe were rejected by the court in avoyelles parish  and the lawsuit against the other defendant went to trial on february  this lawsuit was resolved at trial with a settlement by the codefendant that included a million payment and certain cleanup activities to be conducted by the codefendant 
the codefendant further claimed to receive a right to continue to pursue the original plaintiff s claims 
the codefendant sought to dismiss the bankruptcies 
in addition  the codefendant filed proofs of claim against both our subsidiary and its parent with regard to its claims arising out of the settlement of the lawsuit 
on february   the bankruptcy court denied the codefendant s request to dismiss the bankruptcy case but modified the automatic stay to allow the codefendant to proceed on its claims against the debtors  our subsidiary and its parent  and their insurance companies 
the codefendant subsequently filed suit against the debtors and certain of its insurers in the court of avoyelles parish to determine their liability for the settlement 
the denial of the motion to dismiss the bankruptcies was appealed 
on appeal the bankruptcy cases were ordered to be dismissed  and the bankruptcies were dismissed on june  on march   globalsantafe and the two subsidiaries filed a declaratory judgment action in state district court in houston  texas against the codefendant and the debtors seeking a declaration that globalsantafe and the two subsidiaries had no liability under legal theories advanced by the codefendant 
this action is currently stayed 
on march   the codefendant filed a motion for leave to amend the pending litigation in avoyelles parish to add globalsantafe  transocean worldwide inc  its successor and our wholly owned subsidiary  and one of the subsidiaries as well as various additional insurers 
leave to amend was granted and the amended petition was filed 
an extension to respond for all purposes was agreed until april  for the debtors  globalsantafe  transocean worldwide inc and the subsidiary 
on april   globalsantafe and its two subsidiaries filed various exceptions seeking dismissal of the avoyelles parish lawsuit  which have been denied 
subsequent to denial  globalsantafe and its two subsidiaries filed supervisory writs with the third circuit court of appeals for the state of louisiana 
on december   as permitted under the existing case management order  globalsantafe and various subsidiaries served third party demands joining various insurers in the avoyelles parish lawsuit seeking insurance coverage for the claims brought against globalsantafe and such subsidiaries 
on january   one of the insurers filed pleadings removing the avoyelles parish lawsuit to the united states district court for the western district of louisiana  alexandria division the western district action 
on february   globalsantafe and the two subsidiaries filed motions to dismiss the western district action  which are now pending 
a motion to remand was filed by the codefendant and a hearing on the motion was held on april  a report and recommendations were issued on april  by the magistrate in favor of granting the motion to remand 
objections to this report were filed with the district court 
on september  the district court adopted the report and recommendations and remanded the matter to the state court in avoyelles parish 
separately  the removing insurer has filed an appeal of the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit challenging the remand order and seeking to stay or enjoin the state court from proceeding until a determination of the appeal 
the appeal is currently pending in the initial briefing state 
subsequent to the remand  a scheduling order has been entered in the avoyelles parish lawsuit and a jury trial is set for september  in the interim  discovery is ongoing 
we believe that these legal theories advanced by the codefendant should not be applied against globalsantafe or transocean worldwide inc our subsidiary  its parent and globalsantafe intend to continue to vigorously defend against any action taken in an attempt to impose liability against them under the theories discussed above or otherwise and believe they have good and valid defenses thereto 
we do not believe that these claims will have a material impact on our consolidated statement of financial position  results of operations or cash flows

on december   the aggregate amount of par value of our outstanding shares was chf billion  equivalent to billion  and the aggregate amount of qualifying additional paid in capital of our outstanding shares was at least chf billion  equivalent to at least billion  at an exchange rate of to chf on december  consequently  we expect that a substantial amount of any potential future distributions may be exempt from swiss withholding tax 
repurchases of shares repurchases of shares for the purposes of capital reduction are treated as a partial liquidation subject to the percent swiss withholding tax 
however  for shares repurchased for capital reduction  the portion of the repurchase price attributable to the par value of the shares repurchased will not be subject to the swiss withholding tax 
since january   the portion of the repurchase price that is according to swiss tax law and practice attributable to the qualifying additional paid in capital for swiss statutory reporting purposes of the shares repurchased will also not be subject to the swiss withholding tax 
we would be required to withhold at such rate the tax from the difference between the repurchase price and the related amount of par value and  since january  the related amount of qualifying additional paid in capital  if any 
we would be required to remit on a net basis the purchase price with the swiss withholding tax deducted to a holder of our shares and pay the withholding tax to the swiss federal tax authorities 
with respect to the refund of swiss withholding tax from the repurchase of shares  see refund of swiss withholding tax on dividends and other distributions below 
in most instances  swiss companies listed on the six carry out share repurchase programs through a second trading line on the six 
swiss institutional investors typically purchase shares from shareholders on the open market and then sell the shares on the second trading line back to the company 
the swiss institutional investors are generally able to receive a full refund of the withholding tax 
due to  among other things  the time delay between the sale to the company and the institutional investors receipt of the refund  the price companies pay to repurchase their shares has historically been slightly higher but less than one percent than the price of such companies shares in ordinary trading on the six first trading line 
because our shares are listed on the six  we may repurchase our shares from institutional investors who are generally able to receive a full refund of the swiss withholding tax via a second trading line on the six 
there may not be sufficient liquidity in our shares on the six to repurchase the amount of shares that we would like to repurchase using the second trading line on the six 
in relation to the us market  we may therefore repurchase such shares using an alternative procedure pursuant to which we repurchase our shares via a virtual second trading line from market players  such as banks and institutional investors  who are generally entitled to receive a full refund of the swiss withholding tax 
currently  our ability to use the virtual second trading line will be limited to the share repurchase program currently approved by our shareholders  and any use of the virtual second trading line with respect to future share repurchase programs will require approval of the competent swiss tax and other authorities 
we may not be able to repurchase as many shares as we would like to repurchase for purposes of capital reduction on either the virtual second trading line or a six second trading line without subjecting the selling shareholders to swiss withholding taxes 
the repurchase of shares for purposes other than for cancellation  such as to retain as treasury shares for use in connection with stock incentive plans  convertible debt or other instruments within certain periods  will generally not be subject to swiss withholding tax
