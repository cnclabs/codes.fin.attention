item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data  our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this document 
in addition to historical information  the discussion below contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
these forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  those matters discussed under the heading forward looking statements  above 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward looking statements due to various factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth under item a 
risk factors in this annual report on form k and elsewhere in this document 
overview we are a supplier of semiconductor wafer processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits ics 
our manufacturing equipment is primarily used for semiconductor manufacturing 
our manufacturing equipment utilizes innovative technology to deliver advanced processing capabilities and high productivity for the fabrication of current and next generation ics 
we were incorporated in california in and reincorporated in delaware in our business depends upon capital expenditures by manufacturers of semiconductor devices 
the level of capital expenditures by these manufacturers depends upon the current and anticipated market demand for such devices 
because the demand for semiconductor devices is highly cyclical  the demand for wafer processing equipment is also highly cyclical 
the semiconductor equipment industry is typically characterized by wide swings in operating results as the industry moves through its cycle 
in  the semiconductor capital equipment market was impacted by several natural disasters  the continuing global macroeconomic problems  semiconductor inventory overbuild and dram oversupply 
the dram market declined significantly in  with dram capital expenditures continuing to soften 
despite the decline in dram  the nand flash memory represented a growth segment in the semiconductor market in  with revenue expected to grow for the year 
the transition to mobility products such as tablet and ereader products  smartphones and the solid state drives ssds helped to drive ic demand in the nand flash  advanced risc machines arm and some advanced foundry areas 
overall  this resulted in demand that was technology based in anticipation of capacity increases 
in  we solidified our new positions in etch and strip  and expanded rtp into foundry 
we announced our move into silicon etch with the introduction of our new paradigme si system 
the new system s capability to perform the expanded silicon etch applications has increased our served available market 
etch now addresses over half of the applications in the total etch market 
we grew the etch business by approximately percent and expect etch to contribute a significant portion of total revenue in as more customers select our etch tools based on the process performance and cost of ownership 
in  we gained market share in strip  realizing new positions in foundry  logic  and nand flash 
these positions allowed strip to grow percent over we introduced our suprema xp  based on the production proven  high throughput suprema platform providing further productivity value to the industry 
the suprema series provides the technology extendibility  performance  cost of ownership and reliability that chipmakers require for high volume production of current and future generation logic  dram and flash memory devices 
suprema achieved wins at nm and below in both the foundry and memory markets  which will enable us to participate in advanced volume production facilities in the future 
in  we gained new positions in rtp with our helios xp system at three major foundry customers  with the first of these now in volume production 
we shipped volume levels of our helios rtp systems to a major nand flash memory manufacturer  a new position we gained during the last cycle 
additionally  our millios millisecond anneal system msa is now positioned at three key foundry logic customers 
in  our revenue increased by million to million from million in  due to our product traction  growth in our etch business and expansion of our strip products into the logic foundry sector 
gross profit in was million compared to a million in the increase in gross profit was primarily due to operating leverage from higher net sales  improved factory utilization and continued traction with our cost reduction measures 
our operating expenses in remained relatively flat compared with  at million  but is significantly reduced from the levels prior to the downturn 
excluding restructuring charges  our operating expenses decreased by million as compared to the impact of having better operating leverage from higher net sales and the cost reduction measures contributed to a lower net loss in of million compared to million in results of operations years ended december  and the following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the years ended december  and  and the year over year increase decrease in our results  expressed both in dollar amounts in thousands and as a percentage of net sales  except where indicated year ended december  increase decrease thousands thousands thousands net sales    cost of sales    gross profit    operating expenses research  development and engineering   selling  general and administrative   restructuring charges   n m total operating expenses   loss from operations    interest income expense  net other income expense  net loss before income taxes   provision for income taxes   net income loss   not meaningful net sales net sales were million in  an increase of million or percent  compared to million in the increase in net sales was primarily due to the improvement in the global economy and the semiconductor equipment sector as compared to the prior year  and from our continued penetration in the etch market which contributed over one third of our system sales in in  system sales generated from the etch market were over million higher than in in  international sales to customers in europe and asia continued to account for a significant portion of our total net sales  comprising approximately percent of net sales in  compared to percent in we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our net sales 
cost of sales our cost of sales consists of the costs associated with manufacturing our products  and includes the purchase of raw materials and related overhead  labor  warranty costs  charges for excess and obsolete inventory and costs incurred by our contract manufacturers in the production of our components  major subassemblies modules and complete systems 
in  we reclassified certain current and prior period costs  including million in related to our spare parts business from selling  general and administrative expense to cost of sales  as they more appropriately reflect costs associated with revenue generating activities 
cost of sales was million in  an increase of million or percent  compared to million in the increase in cost of sales was primarily related to costs associated with higher volumes of sales in gross profit gross profit is calculated as net sales less cost of sales 
gross margin rate is gross profit reflected as a percentage of net sales 
gross margin rate improved from percent in to percent in the increase in gross margin in was primarily due to operating leverage from higher net sales volumes and improved utilization of our internal manufacturing operations  partially offset by an increase of approximately million in warranty provisions related to servicing our new products and a higher number of sales from our lower margin aspen iii systems  as compared to our total sales mix 
gross margin rate was favorably impacted in and  as we recorded a net benefit of million and million  respectively  related to the sale of previously written down inventories  net of inventory valuation charges 
our gross margin rate has varied over the years and will continue to be affected by many factors  including competitive pressures  product mix  inventory reserves  economies of scale  material and other costs  overhead absorption levels and the timing of revenue recognition 
research  development and engineering research  development and engineering expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in research  development and engineering activities  costs of product development and depreciation on equipment used in the course of research  development and engineering activities 
research  development and engineering expenses were million in  a decrease of million or percent  compared to million in the decrease in research  development and engineering expenses was primarily due to a decrease of million in depreciation expense on lab tools resulting from significantly lower capital expenditures in through as compared to earlier years  and from a million decrease in engineering materials used in new product development projects 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses  as well as legal and professional fees  facilities expenses excluding research and development focused sites  insurance expenses  amortization of evaluation systems and certain information technology costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  a decrease of million compared to million in the slight decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a million allocation of field service costs to cost of sales as a result of higher utilization rates  a decrease of million in outside service spending levels and a decrease of stock compensation expense of million  partially offset by a million reduction year over year in the collection of certain accounts receivable previously provided for in the allowance for doubtful accounts and a million increase in amortization expense for evaluation tools placed at customer sites in late restructuring charges in  we incurred million in contract termination costs related to revised estimates of our future rent obligations associated with a vacated leased facility  net of sublease income 
the revised estimates are based on a final settlement with the landlord  which includes exiting from the lease arrangement in july  rather than the initial lease expiration of march the final settlement also reduces our total future lease commitments from million to million  which includes a lease termination and other fees of million 
during the fourth quarter of  we also initiated a cost reduction plan that includes workforce reductions and transitioning our operations in canada to our germany facility 
as of december   we recorded million in employee severance benefits related to this restructuring 
we expect to incur approximately million in employee separation and other charges in related to this restructuring plan 
in  based on revised estimates  we reversed a net million in restructuring reserves  related to earlier cost reduction plans 
other income expense  net other income expense  net was million of income in  an increase of million when compared to million of income in the increase in income was due to a million gain related to the extinguishment of certain liabilities  partially offset by net foreign exchange losses primarily related to our foreign denominated balances at our us operations 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was million in  which consisted of deferred tax expense from the creation of a valuation allowance of million against deferred tax assets in a foreign jurisdiction  current foreign taxes of million and current federal and state income taxes of million  partially offset by a million benefit from the release of various foreign reserves 
the provision for income taxes was million in  which consisted of a provision for foreign taxes of million  partially offset by a million benefit from the release of various foreign reserves and a benefit for federal and state income taxes of million 
currently  we have provided a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for all jurisdictions due to uncertainties and other negative evidence in our current operations and our expectations of future operations 
it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
our provision for income taxes could be favorably impacted going forward if our results of operations and forecasts for future profitability improve sufficiently to indicate that the related deferred tax assets will be realized 
such a change in management s expectations could result in a material change to our valuation allowance assessment and the resulting income tax provision 
years ended december  and the following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the years ended december  and  and the year over year increase decrease in our results  expressed both in dollar amounts in thousands and as a percentage of net sales  except where indicated year ended december  increase decrease thousands thousands thousands net sales    cost of sales    gross profit loss    n m operating expenses research  development and engineering   selling  general and administrative   restructuring charges   n m total operating expenses   loss from operations    interest income expense  net other income expense  net   loss before income taxes   provision for benefit from income taxes   n m net income loss   not meaningful net sales net sales were million in  an increase of million or percent  compared to million in the increase in net sales was primarily due to the improvement in the global economy and the semiconductor equipment sector 
the low level of net sales in reflected the trough of the downturn in the semiconductor equipment industry 
since sales bottomed out in the first quarter of  we have experienced seven consecutive quarters of growth  as the upturn has moved from a period of principally technology purchases to the current capacity building phase of the cycle 
accordingly  the year over year increase in sales was broad based across all of our products 
in addition  our penetration of the etch market during contributed over percent to our system sales compared with approximately percent in in  international sales to customers in europe and asia  continued to account for a significant portion of our total net sales  comprising approximately percent of net sales in  compared to percent in cost of sales cost of sales was million in  an increase of million or percent  compared to million in the increase in cost of sales was primarily related to costs associated with increased product sales resulting from improved market conditions in and realizing the benefits of previous cost reduction efforts described more fully in note restructuring charges 
in  we reclassified certain current and prior period costs  including million in and million in related to our spare parts business from selling  general and administrative expense to cost of sales  as they more appropriately reflect costs associated with revenue generating activities 
gross profit loss gross margin rate improved to percent in  compared to a negative percent in the increase in gross margin in was primarily due to operating leverage from higher net sales volumes  sales of previously written down inventories and an increase in absorption levels  partially offset by an increase in warranty provisions related to the higher net sales 
gross margin rate was favorably impacted in and unfavorably impacted in  as we recorded a net benefit of million compared to a net charge of million in  related to the sale of previously written down inventories  net of inventory valuation charges 
research  development and engineering research  development and engineering expenses were million in  an increase of million or percent  compared to million in the increase in research  development and engineering expenses was primarily due to a million increase in materials used in new product development projects and a million increase in salaries and related costs resulting from increased headcount and a reduction in the number of work furloughs throughout  partially offset by a decrease of million in depreciation and amortization related to equipment that was fully depreciated in selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses remained flat in at million  as compared to million in selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a result of higher level of revenues and related business activities in  including increases in costs related to legal fees  sales commissions and amortization of evaluation systems  offset by a reduction year over year in the collection of certain accounts receivable previously provided for in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
restructuring charges in response to declining revenues  we implemented several restructuring programs to reduce our cost structure in and  which combined to reduce our workforce by approximately percent over those two years 
restructuring charges recorded under these programs were primarily for estimated employee severance costs and lease termination costs  which have since been adjusted to reflect revised estimates and actual amounts paid 
in  based on revised estimates  we reversed a net million in restructuring reserves  which is included in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
in  restructuring expenses were million  comprised of million in employee severance costs and million in lease termination costs 
interest and other income expense  net interest income was million in  a decrease of million when compared to million in the decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower cash investment balances during fiscal other income expense  net was million of income in  a decrease of million when compared to million of income in the decrease in foreign currency gains related to the significant fluctuation in our foreign denominated balances at our us operations provision for benefit from income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes was a million net provision in  which consisted of a million provision for foreign taxes partially offset by a million benefit for federal and state income taxes 
provision for benefit from income taxes in was an million net benefit  which consisted of a million benefit from the settlement of a german tax audit for tax years to  partially offset by provisions for foreign taxes and for federal and state income taxes of million and million  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments were million as of december   an increase of approximately million  as compared to million as of december  stockholders equity as of december  was million  as compared to million as of december  working capital as of december  was million  as compared to million as of december  liquidity and capital resources outlook as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital of million 
we believe that these balances will be sufficient to fund our working and other capital requirements over the course of the next twelve months 
our operations require careful management of our cash and working capital balances 
our liquidity is affected by many factors including  among others  fluctuations in our revenue  gross profits and operating expenses  as well as changes in our operating assets and liabilities 
the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry makes it difficult to predict our future liquidity needs with certainty 
any upturn in the semiconductor industry would result in short term uses of cash to fund inventory purchases and accounts receivable 
alternatively  any renewed softening in the demand for our products or ineffectiveness of our cost reduction efforts may cause us to incur additional losses in the future and lower our cash balances 
we may need additional funds to support our working capital requirements  operating expenses or for other requirements 
historically  we have relied on a combination of fundraising from the sale and issuance of equity securities such as our common stock offering in may and cash generated from product  service and royalty revenues to provide funding for our operations 
we will continue to review our expected cash requirements and take appropriate cost reduction measures to ensure that we have sufficient liquidity 
we periodically review our liquidity position and may decide to raise additional funds  and may seek them from a combination of sources including issuance of equity or debt securities through public or private financings 
these financing options may not be available on a timely basis  or on terms acceptable to us  and could be dilutive to our stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  our ability to achieve our intended long term business objectives could be limited 
contractual obligations under us generally accepted accounting principles  certain obligations and commitments are not required to be included in our consolidated balance sheet 
these obligations and commitments  while entered into in the normal course of business  may have a material impact on our liquidity 
our contractual commitments as of december  are summarized in the following table operating vendor commitments lease sub total payments contractor inventory other total commitments thousands thereafter   other vendor commitments primarily include service related contracts and agreements for information technology support  commitments for non inventory purchases of assets  and other service related commitments 
we continue to lease one building previously used to house the administrative functions related to wet surface preparation products in exton  pennsylvania 
the original lease for the administrative building was scheduled to expire on march   with a current rental cost of approximately million annually 
in december  we reached a final settlement with the landlord  which includes exiting from the lease arrangement in july the final settlement also reduces our total future lease obligations from million to million  which includes a lease termination and broker s fee of million 
of the million in future lease obligations  we expect to pay out million in and the remaining balance on a declining basis through july we continue to sublease a portion of the exton facility  cancelable by our subtenant anytime after december  our sublease income under the current sublease agreement was million for in determining facilities lease loss liability  various assumptions were made  including the time period over which the buildings will be vacant  expected sublease terms and expected sublease rates 
at december  and  we had an accrued liability balance of million and million  respectively  related to this facility 
adjustments to this accrual will be made in future periods  if events and circumstances change 
our deferred income taxes have been excluded from the table above because the related future cash outflows are uncertain 
as of december   we had approximately million of net unrecognized tax benefits that may be subject to examination by applicable tax authorities 
we are uncertain of the timing and amounts of any potential future payments related to these unrecognized tax benefits 
in connection with our acquisition of vortek industries  ltd vortek in  we became party to an agreement between vortek and the canadian minister of industry the minister relating to an investment in vortek by technology partnerships canada 
under the agreement  as amended  we  or vortek renamed mattson technology  canada  inc or mtc agreed to various covenants  including i payment by us of a royalty to the minister of percent of revenues from certain flash rtp products  up to a total of cad  approximately million based on the applicable exchange rate as of december   ii mtc maintaining a specified average workforce of employees in canada through october   iii investment of a certain amount by october  and certain other covenants concerning manufacturing obligations 
under the provisions of this agreement  if we  or mtc  did not materially satisfy the obligations pursuant to the covenants  the minister could have demanded payment of liquidated damages in the amount of cad  less any royalties paid by mtc or us to the minister 
as of december   we were no longer subject to covenants ii and iii  as discussed above  but are still subject to covenant i  relating to the payment of royalty on revenues from certain flash rtp products until however  if mtc is dissolved  files for bankruptcy or does not materially comply with certain other terms and conditions of the contract prior to its expiration on december   we could be subject to liquidated damages in the amount of cad  less any royalties paid by mtc or us to the minister 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of regulation s k 
cash flows from operating activities in  net cash used in operations was million  comprised primarily of a net loss of million  partially offset by million of cash increases reflected in the net change in assets and liabilities and non cash charges of million 
cash flow increases resulting from the net change in assets and liabilities primarily consisted of a million increase in deferred revenue  a million increase in accrued liabilities  a million increase in other liabilities  a million decrease in inventories and a million increase in other assets  partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable  a million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets  a million increase in accounts receivable and advance billings  and a million decrease in income taxes payable  non current 
the increase in accounts receivable and advance billings reflects the increase in sales and business activities in as compared to non cash charges consisted primarily of million of depreciation and amortization  million for deferred income taxes and million of stock based compensation  partially offset by a million gain on sale of fixed assets 
in  net cash used in operations was million  comprised primarily of a net loss of million and million of cash decreases reflected in the net change in assets and liabilities  partially offset by non cash charges of million

the increases in accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable reflect the sharp increase in sales and business activities in as compared to non cash charges consisted primarily of million of depreciation and amortization  million of stock based compensation  million for deferred taxes and million of other non cash charges  partially offset by million from the collection of accounts receivable previously provided for in the allowance for doubtful accounts during the recent industry downturn 
in  net cash used in operations was million  comprised primarily of a net loss of million  offset by non cash charges of million and million of cash increases reflected in the net change in assets and liabilities 
non cash charges consisted primarily of million in depreciation and amortization charges  million in stock based compensation and million in charges for other non cash items  partially offset by a million net tax benefit  primarily consisting of a million reversal of certain foreign deferred tax liabilities  and million from the collection of accounts receivable previously provided for in the allowance for doubtful accounts during the recent industry downturn 
cash flow increases resulting from the net change in assets and liabilities primarily consisted of a million decrease in inventories  a million decrease in accounts receivable and advanced billings  a million decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a million combined increase in accounts payable  income taxes payable  non current and other liabilities  partially offset by a million decrease in accrued liabilities  a million reduction in deferred revenue and a million increase in other assets 
the decrease in accounts receivable and deferred revenue were largely reflective of the percent decrease in net sales in the decreases in inventories were the result of our efforts to maximize utilization of available inventory  thereby minimizing cash outlays on new inventories 
cash provided by operations may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors  including fluctuations in our net sales and operating results  amount of revenue deferred  inventory purchases  collection of accounts receivable and timing of payments 
cash flows from investing activities in  net cash provided by investing activities was million  comprised primarily of million of maturities of available for sale investments  million decrease in restricted cash used to secure standby letters of credit provided to certain vendors  and million in proceeds from the sale of property and equipment  partially offset by million of property and equipment purchases 
in  net cash provided by investing activities was million  comprised primarily of million of maturities of available for sale investments in excess of purchases  partially offset by million of property and equipment purchases and a million increase in restricted cash 
our property and equipment purchases were primarily for tools and equipment used in our manufacturing activities 
the increase in restricted cash represents purchases of certificates of deposit used to secure standby letters of credit we provided to certain vendors during the year 
in  net cash provided by investing activities was million  comprised primarily of million of maturities of available for sale investments in excess of purchases  partially offset by a million increase in restricted cash and million of property and equipment purchases 
cash flows from financing activities in  net cash provided by financing activities was million  consisting primarily of million of proceeds from our public offering on may  of million shares of our common stock at a price to the public of per share of common stock 
the million of proceeds is net of underwriting discounts and offering expenses of million 
the net proceeds from this offering are being used for general corporate purposes  including working capital 
in addition  we also realized million in net proceeds from employee stock plan transactions 
in  net cash provided by financing activities was million  consisting of net proceeds from employee stock plan transactions 
in  net cash provided by financing activities was million  consisting of net proceeds from employee stock plan transactions 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to reserves for excess and obsolete inventory  warranty obligations  bad debts  goodwill  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring costs  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these form the basis for making judgment about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  warranty obligations  inventories  goodwill and other intangible assets  impairment of long lived assets  restructuring  income taxes and stock based compensation as critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of operations 
see note summary of significant accounting policies of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
we derive revenues from the following primary sources equipment tool or system sales  spare part sales and service and maintenance contracts 
in accordance with the authoritative guidance on revenue recognition  we recognize revenue on equipment sales as follows for equipment sales of existing products with new specifications and for sales of new products  revenue is recognized upon customer acceptance  for equipment sales to existing customers who have purchased the same equipment with the same specifications and previously demonstrated acceptance  or equipment sales to new customers purchasing existing products with established reliability  we recognize revenue on a multiple element approach in which revenue is recognized upon the delivery of the separate elements to the customer and when we receive customer acceptance or is otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations 
for multiple element arrangements initiated at or prior to december   the revenue relating to the undelivered elements is deferred at its estimated fair values until delivery of the deferred elements  and for arrangements initiated or materially modified subsequent to december  containing multiple elements  the revenue relating to the undelivered elements is deferred using the relative selling price method  which allocates revenue to each element using the estimated selling prices for the deliverables when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence is not available 
the maximum revenue we recognize on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items such as installation and customer acceptance 
under this approach  generally percent of the total invoice amount is recognized as revenue upon shipment and transfer of title  percent of the associated tool costs is also recognized upon shipment  and the remaining portion  generally percent of the total invoice amount  is contingent upon customer acceptance and is recognized once installation services are completed and final customer acceptance of the tool is received 
from time to time  we allow customers to evaluate systems  with the customer maintaining the right to return the systems at its discretion with limited or no penalty 
for this type of arrangement  we do not recognize revenue on the evaluation systems until customer acceptance is received 
for spare parts  we recognize revenue upon shipment 
for service and maintenance contracts  we recognize revenue on a straight line basis over the service period of the related contract or as services are performed 
in all cases  revenue is only recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
accounts receivable for which revenue has not been recognized are classified as advance billings 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and record specific allowances for bad debts when a customer is unable to meet its financial obligations  as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deteriorated financial position 
we estimate the allowances for bad debts for all other customers based on factors such as current trends  the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience 
we write off a receivable when all rights  remedies and recourses against the account and its principals are exhausted and record a benefit when previously reserved accounts are collected 
warranty 
the warranty we offer on system sales is generally months  except where previous customer agreements state otherwise 
a provision for the estimated cost of warranty  based on historical costs  is recorded as a cost of sale when the revenue is recognized for the sale of the equipment or parts 
our warranty obligations require us to repair or replace defective products or parts during the warranty period at no cost to the customer 
the actual system performance and or field expense profiles may differ from historical experience  and in those cases we adjust our warranty accruals accordingly 
actual warranty reserves and settlements against reserves are highly dependent on our system volumes 
inventories 
our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on a first in  first out basis  and include material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs 
finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer 
under our general terms of sale  title transfers when we complete physical transfer of the products to the freight carrier unless other customer practices prevail 
all intercompany profits related to the sales and purchases of inventory between our legal entities are eliminated from the consolidated financial statements 
inventory valuation 
our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories  including manufacturing raw materials  work in process  finished goods and spare parts  in each reporting period 
although we attempt to accurately forecast future inventory demand  given the competitive pressures and cyclicality of the semiconductor industry  there may be significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments that could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and reported operating results 
the carrying value of our inventory is reduced for estimated excess and obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand 
we evaluate the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand 
in addition  inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products 
if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated  additional inventory adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory might be required  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
fair value measurements of assets and liabilities 
we measure certain of our assets at fair value  using observable market data 
the authoritative guidance on fair value measurement defines fair value as an exit price  representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants  and establishes valuation hierarchy based on the level of independent objective evidence available regarding the value of assets or liabilities 
the authoritative guidance also establishes three classes of assets or liabilities level consists of assets and liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets  level consists of assets and liabilities for which observable inputs other than level inputs are used such as prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or for identical assets or liabilities in less active markets and model derived valuations for which the variables are derived from or corroborated by observable market data  and level consists of assets and liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value 
our cash equivalents and investment instruments are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy  as these instruments are valued using quoted market prices 
we had no assets or liabilities classified within level or as of december  and impairment of long lived assets 
we review our long lived assets  including property and equipment  intangibles and other long lived assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability is measured by a comparison of the assets carrying amount to their expected future undiscounted net cash flows 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment is measured based on the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
in  we recorded impairment charges to write off intangible assets of million and certain lab assets of million to adjust for the deteriorating value of these assets resulting from the decline in expected cash flows attributable to the assets 
there were no such impairment charges in through restructuring 
we recognize expenses related to employee termination benefits when the benefit arrangement is communicated to the employee and no significant future services are required 
if an employee is required to render service until a specific termination date in order to receive the termination benefits  the fair value of the associated liability would be recognized ratably over the future service period 
the costs of severance are determined by local statutory requirements and our policies 
for some entities  where salaries are paid during the notice period  a portion of the severance reserves would be based on estimates of the ability to find employment during the notice period  and we would determine the reserves in accordance with these estimates 
we recognize the present value of facility lease termination obligations  net of estimated sublease income and other exit costs  when we have future lease payments with no future economic benefit 
in future periods  we will record accretion expense to increase the liability to an amount equal to the estimated future cash payments necessary to exit the lease 
this requires a significant amount of judgment and management estimation in order to determine the expected time frame it will take to secure a subtenant  the amount of sublease income to be received and the appropriate discount rate to calculate the present value of the future cash flows 
if actual lease exit costs differ from estimates  we would adjust the restructuring charge  which would impact net income in the period any adjustment was recorded 
income taxes 
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
for all tax jurisdictions  we recorded a percent valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset as we expect it is more likely than not that we will not realize our net deferred tax asset as of december  in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider historical levels of income and losses  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
in the event we determine that we would be able to realize additional deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  or if we subsequently determine that realization of an amount previously recorded is unlikely  we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance  which would change income in the period of the adjustment 
stock based compensation 
we measure the fair value of all stock based awards  including stock options  restricted stock units  and purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plan  on the date of grant  and we recognize the related stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of certain of our stock based awards 
the determination of fair value using the black scholes model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables  which includes expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee exercise and cancellation behaviors  risk free interest rates  and expected dividends 
we estimate the expected life of options based on an analysis of our historical experience of employee exercise and post vesting termination behavior considered in relation to the contractual life of the option  expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock  and the risk free interest rate is equal to the us treasury rates  with maturity approximating the expected life of the option 
we do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future  accordingly  the expected dividend yield is zero 
we estimate forfeiture rates on stock based awards at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
such forfeiture estimates are based on historical experience 
if the assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense change in future periods  the amount of future stock based compensation may differ significantly from the amounts we recorded in the current and prior periods 
stock based compensation expenses in  and were million  million and million  respectively

interest rate risk as of december   our portfolio consisted of million in cash and cash equivalents 
we did not have any short term investments as of december  our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to short term investments  which we may purchase at different points in time  and the potential losses arising from changes in those interest rates 
our investment objective is to achieve the maximum return compatible with capital preservation and our liquidity requirements 
our strategy is to invest our cash in a manner that preserves capital  maintains sufficient liquidity to meet our cash requirements  and maximizes yields consistent with approved credit risk 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer 
our portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
we classify our cash equivalents and short term investments in accordance with authoritative guidance on accounting for investments in debt and equity securities  consider investments in instruments purchased with an original maturity of days or less to be cash equivalents  and classify our short term investments as available for sale 
our cash equivalents and short term investment portfolios consist primarily of money market funds and us government and government sponsored debt securities 
our short term investments are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  included in accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the amortization of premiums and discounts on the investments  realized gains and losses  and declines in value judged to be other than temporary on available for sale securities are included in other income expense  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations
