the economic environment over the past few years has motivated changes in the consumption habits of the retail consumer which continues to impact our financial results 
economic uncertainty  tumultuous market conditions and low levels of consumer confidence have created changes in the type of products purchased by our customers and increased the competitive environment in our primary markets 
we compete with other traditional grocery retailers  as well as other retail outlets including  but not limited to  discount retailers such as neighborhood or supercenters and club and warehouse stores  specialty supermarkets and drug stores 
generally  our markets continue to experience new store opening activity and increased feature pricing or everyday low prices by competitors 
we utilize information gathered from various sources  including our very important customer vic loyalty card program  and work with suppliers to deliver effective retail pricing and targeted promotional spending programs that drive customer traffic and create value for our customers 
in addition  our product selection  assortment and variety  and our focus on customer service differentiate us from our competitors 
in june  the company completed its purchase and sale agreement with lowe s food stores  inc the lowes foods transaction 
per the agreement harris teeter acquired ten lowes foods store locations in the central carolinas region and lowes foods acquired six harris teeter store locations in western north carolina 
the majority of the stores acquired were temporarily closed for remodeling  stocking and training of employees 
six of the acquired stores were re opened during the fourth quarter of fiscal subsequent to the end of fiscal  two of the acquired stores were re opened under a new format and banner central 
the central format features a worldwide variety of wine  beer  specialty foods and other selected merchandise 
the company continued with its planned new store development program and during fiscal  has opened thirteen new stores which includes six of the stores acquired from lowes foods and one replacement and closed eight stores comprised of the six stores sold to lowes foods  one replacement that opened in fiscal and one replacement that is expected to open in fiscal for a net addition of five stores 
in addition  one store located in the washington dc market was closed due to flooding that occurred in the third quarter of fiscal the company is in the process of repairing damage and expects to re open the store during fiscal during fiscal  the company opened seven new stores and closed two stores for a net addition of five stores  and during fiscal  the company opened new stores and closed three stores for a net addition of stores 
much of the company s new store growth is focused on expanding its washington  dc metro market area which incorporates northern virginia  the district of columbia  southern maryland and coastal delaware 
during fiscal  the company acquired  square feet of additional distribution capacity that is contiguous to its existing distribution facility in greensboro  north carolina 
this represented an approximate increase in the square footage of the company s existing distribution facilities and was acquired to meet our continued growth 
there were stores in operations at the end of fiscal  as compared to at the end of fiscal and at the end of fiscal results of operations the following table sets forth the components of consolidated net earnings for the company for the weeks ended october  fiscal and october  fiscal and the weeks ended october  fiscal  respectively

the increase in sales in fiscal and fiscal was attributable to increases in comparable store sales see definition below and sales from new stores that were partially offset by store closings 
the fiscal sales increase over fiscal was impacted by the fact that fiscal was a week year 
on a comparable week basis reducing fiscal sales for the first week of the annual period  sales increased by from fiscal to fiscal comparable store sales for fiscal increased million  as compared to an increase of million in fiscal and a decrease of million in fiscal adjusted to weeks 
comparable store sales have been negatively impacted  to some extent  by the cannibalization created by strategically opening stores in key major markets that have a close proximity to existing stores 
management believes that the company s strategy of opening additional stores within close proximity to existing stores  and any similar new additions in the foreseeable future  have a strategic benefit of enabling the company to capture sales and expand market share as the markets it serves continue to grow 
during fiscal  the company increased the number of stores in operation by five  as compared to a net increase of five stores during fiscal and a net increase of stores during fiscal the increase in sales from new stores exceeded the loss of sales from closed stores by million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the company has responded to its customers changing buying habits with increased promotional activity designed to increase the overall value to the customers 
during fiscal  on a comparable basis  customer visits  average basket size and the average number of items sold increased 
in addition  harris teeter experienced average increases in active households per comparable store based on vic data of  evidencing a continued growing customer base in those stores 
store brand penetration has also increased on a year over year basis 
store brand penetration based on units sold increased basis points to in fiscal from in fiscal store brand penetration based on sales dollars increased by basis points to in fiscal from in fiscal the company considers its reporting of comparable store sales growth to be effective in determining core sales growth during periods of fluctuation in the number of stores in operation  their locations and their sizes 
while there is no standard industry definition of comparable store sales  the company has been consistently applying the following definition 
comparable store sales are computed using corresponding calendar weeks to account for the occasional extra week included in a fiscal year 
a new store must be in operation for months before it enters into the calculation of comparable store sales 
a closed store is removed from the calculation in the month in which its closure is announced 
a new store opening within an approximate two mile radius of an existing store that is to be closed as a result of the new store opening is included as a replacement store in the comparable store sales measurement as if it were the same store 
sales increases resulting from existing comparable stores that are expanded in size are included in the calculations of comparable store sales  if the store remains open during the construction period 
if the location is closed during the construction period  the sales during the reporting period are removed from the calculation 
if the location is completely rebuilt  it is reported as a replacement store and included in the same store sales calculation for the weeks actually open 
comparable store sales for fiscal was computed on a week basis by reducing fiscal sales for the first week of the annual period 
gross profit gross profit as a percent to sales increased basis points from fiscal to fiscal and declined basis points from fiscal to fiscal the increase in the gross profit margin from fiscal to fiscal was driven by a decrease in the annual lifo charge between the respective years and an improvement of basis points in the retail gross profit margin resulting from our effective promotional activity 
the decrease in the gross profit margin from fiscal to fiscal was driven by an increase in the annual lifo charge between the respective years and the company s efforts to drive sales through its promotional activity  which includes lowering the sales price on selected items price investment that resulted in a reduction in the retail gross profit margin by basis points during fiscal the annual lifo adjustment reduced gross profit by million to sales in fiscal  reduced gross profit by million to sales in fiscal and increased gross profit by million to sales in fiscal expenses selling  general administrative sg a expenses for fiscal and its percent to sales increased from fiscal by million and basis points  respectively 
the increase was driven by incremental store growth and its impact on associated operational costs such as labor  credit and debit card fees  rent and other occupancy costs  and million or basis points on a percent to sales basis of lowes foods transaction incremental costs as described below 
the increase in sg a expenses excluding advertising and support department costs from fiscal to fiscal for stores opened during fiscal and fiscal accounted for million of the million increase in total sg a expenses 
store labor and benefit costs increased from fiscal to fiscal by million and represented a basis point increase on a percent to sales basis 
increased costs of million in advertising and support departments between fiscal and fiscal represented a basis point increase on a percent to sales basis 
sg a expenses for fiscal increased from fiscal by million as a result of incremental store growth 
however  sg a expenses as a percent to sales decreased basis points from fiscal to  as a result of the leverage created through sales gains that apply against fixed costs  along with improved labor management and other cost control initiatives 
the increase in sg a expenses excluding advertising and support department costs over the previous year for stores opened in fiscal and fiscal amounted to million  exceeding the million increase in total sg a expenses from fiscal to fiscal even though store labor and associated benefit costs increased between fiscal and fiscal  as a result of harris teeter s new store growth  there was a basis point reduction in these costs as a percent to sales 
advertising and support department costs as a percent to sales also declined between fiscal and fiscal  representing a basis point reduction 
the company continues to focus on its cost control programs in an effort to offset increased fringe benefit costs associated with incentive bonus plans and pension expense  as well as increased remodeling expenses resulting from the company s store remodeling program 
pre opening costs are included with sg a expenses and consist of rent  labor and associated fringe benefits  and recruiting and relocation costs incurred prior to a new store opening and amounted to million of sales for fiscal excluding stores acquired from lowes foods  as compared to million of sales for fiscal and million of sales in fiscal pre opening costs fluctuate between reporting periods depending on the new store opening schedule and market location 
the lowes foods transaction incremental costs of million consist of million in non cash impairment charges related to the write off of a portion of the goodwill that related to stores not integrated into the operations 
the costs also include an increase in the company s closed store reserves of million  incremental pre opening costs associated with the stores acquired and other fair market adjustments to fixed assets and intangibles 
corporate sg a expenses include a portion of compensation and benefits of holding company employees and certain other costs that have not historically been fully allocated to the company s operating subsidiaries 
corporate sg a expenses for fiscal were offset by million of gains recorded in connection with proceeds received on company owned life insurance policies 
corporate sg a expenses in fiscal were reduced by million as a result of gains realized in connection with the exchange of the company s corporate aircraft 
net interest expense interest expense less interest income for fiscal decreased by million from the prior year period 
net interest expense for fiscal included a reversal of accrued interest amounting to million that was associated with a reduction of the company s unrecognized tax positions and approximately million of additional interest income associated with income tax refunds 
net interest expense has also been reduced as a result of lower interest on debt borrowings due to lower average outstanding borrowings 
net investment gains for fiscal include a pre tax gain of million the company realized upon the sale of the company s foreign investment 
the effective consolidated income tax rate on continuing operations for fiscal was as compared to for fiscal and for fiscal income tax expense for fiscal was favorably impacted by the non taxable gains on insurance proceeds received in the third quarter of fiscal and income tax expense for fiscal included additional foreign taxes paid in connection with the gain realized on the sale of the company s foreign investment 
continuing operations as a result of the items discussed above  earnings from continuing operations after tax were million  or per diluted share  in fiscal  as compared to million  or per diluted share  in fiscal and million  or per diluted share  in fiscal a week year 
in fiscal  the lowes foods transaction incremental costs reduced earnings from continuing operations after tax by million  or per diluted share  the life insurance gains increased earnings from continuing operations after tax by million  or per diluted share  and the interest expense reversal increased earnings from continuing operations after tax by million  or per diluted share 
the after tax gain on the sale of the company s foreign investment company increased fiscal earnings from continuing operations by million  or per diluted share

outlook the company s operating performance and strong financial position provide the flexibility to continue with its store development program for new and replacement stores along with the remodeling and expansion of existing stores 
during fiscal  the company plans to open twelve new stores which includes two replacements and the two store locations acquired from lowes foods that were converted to our central format and complete major remodels on nine stores three of which will be expanded in size 
the fiscal new store openings are currently scheduled for three in the first quarter  two in the third quarter and seven in the fourth quarter 
the store development program is expected to result in a increase in retail square footage as compared to a increase realized in fiscal the company routinely evaluates its existing store operations in regards to its overall business strategy and from time to time will close or divest older or underperforming stores 
the new store program anticipates the continued expansion of harris teeter s existing markets  including the washington  dc metro market area which incorporates northern virginia  the district of columbia  southern maryland and coastal delaware 
real estate development by its nature is both unpredictable and subject to external factors including weather  construction schedules and costs 
any change in the amount and timing of new store development can impact the expected capital expenditures  sales and operating results 
startup costs associated with opening new stores can negatively impact operating margins and net income 
in the current competitive environment  promotional costs to maintain market share could also negatively impact operating margins and net income in future periods 
the continued execution of productivity initiatives implemented throughout all stores  maintaining controls over waste  implementation of operating efficiencies and effective merchandising strategies will dictate the pace at which the company s operating results could improve  if at all 
the company s management remains cautious in its expectations for fiscal due to the current economic environment and its impact on the company s customers 
the company will continue to refine its merchandising strategies to respond to the changing shopping demands 
the retail grocery market remains intensely competitive  including the possibility of new competitors coming into the company s existing markets 
any operating improvement will be dependent on the company s ability to increase market share  control costs and to effectively execute the company s strategic expansion plans 
capital resources and liquidity the company s principal source of liquidity has been cash generated from operating activities of harris teeter and borrowings available under the company s credit facility 
during fiscal  the net cash provided by operating activities was million  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease from fiscal to fiscal was driven by lower earnings and the timing of accruals and related payments associated with normal operations 
investing activities in fiscal required net cash of million and included among other items approximately million in cash proceeds from the sale of a e and million of cash paid for the lowes foods transaction 
fiscal investing activities were million and included harris teeter s sale of its ownership position in five investment properties along with one owned property which generated million of cash and the company s sale of a foreign investment which generated million of cash 
historically  capital spending has been financed by cash provided by operating activities and supplemented with borrowings under the company s credit facility 
financing activities in fiscal utilized million of cash and included million for the repayment of the term loan under the company s prior credit facility 
financing activity also included million for the payment of dividends in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal consisting of five quarterly payments 
fiscal capital expenditures totaled million  as compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal fiscal capital expenditures included million for the exchange of the corporate aircraft  which was partially offset by million of proceeds from the sale of the old aircraft 
capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to total approximately million 
the company anticipates that its capital investment for new store growth and store remodels will be concentrated in its existing markets for fiscal  as well as in the foreseeable future 
the company has sufficient resources through internally generated funds  proceeds from the sale of a e and borrowings available under the company s credit facility to complete the planned capital investment 
management believes that the company s revolving line of credit provides sufficient liquidity for what management expects the company will require through the expiration of the line of credit in january  on january   the company amended and restated its then existing credit agreement that provided financing under a million term loan and a million revolving line of credit 
the prior credit agreement was due to expire in december of and the company had previously repaid million of the term loan prior to the closing of the amended credit facility 
the amended credit facility contains a revolving line of credit that provides for financing up to million through its termination date on january  in connection with the closing of the amended credit agreement  the company repaid the remaining million term loan under the prior credit facility utilizing million of cash and million of borrowings under the new revolver 
the amended credit agreement provides for an optional increase of the revolving credit facility by an additional amount of up to million if the existing or new lenders agree to assume the additional commitments and two one year maturity extension options  both of which require consent of certain of the lenders 
outstanding borrowings under the amended credit agreement bear interest at a variable rate  at the company s option at a an alternate base rate  based on a reference to rates on federal funds transactions with members of the federal reserve system  the prime rate  or the libor market index rate in effect on the interest determination date  b the libor market index rate  or c a libor rate  each plus an applicable margin as determined by the administrative agent in accordance with the terms of the amended credit agreement 
the amount which may be borrowed from time to time and the applicable margin to the referenced interest rate are each dependent on a leverage factor 
the leverage factor is based on a ratio of rent adjusted consolidated funded debt divided by earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and operating rents  as set forth in the amended credit agreement 
the more significant of the financial covenants that the company must meet during the term of the amended credit agreement include a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
the amended credit agreement restricts the company s ability to pay dividends and make certain other restricted payments  as defined in the amended credit agreement  if after giving effect to such restricted payment an event of default under the amended credit agreement would exist or the company would not be in compliance with certain specified financial covenants 
however  management does not expect these restrictions will affect the company s ability to pay dividends at the current level in the foreseeable future 
as of october   the company was in compliance with all financial covenants of the amended credit facility 
issued letters of credit reduced the amount available for borrowings under the amended credit facility and amounted to million as of october  in addition to the million of borrowings available under the company s amended credit facility  the company has the capacity to borrow up to an aggregate amount of million from two major us life insurance companies utilizing certain insurance assets as collateral 
in the normal course of business  the company will continue to evaluate other financing opportunities based on the company s needs and market conditions 
covenants in certain of the company s long term debt agreements limit the total indebtedness that the company may incur 
as of october   the amount of additional debt that could be incurred within the limitations of the most restrictive debt covenants exceeded the additional borrowings available under the amended credit facility 
as such  management believes that the limit on indebtedness does not restrict the company s ability to meet future liquidity requirements through borrowings available under the company s amended credit facility  including any liquidity requirements expected in connection with the company s expansion plans for the foreseeable future 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the company has assumed various financial obligations and commitments in the normal course of its operations and financing activities 
financial obligations are considered to represent known future cash payments that the company is required to make under existing contractual arrangements  such as debt and lease agreements 
management expects that cash provided by operations and other sources of liquidity  such as the company s amended credit facility and new sources of financing available to the company  will be sufficient to meet these obligations on a short and long term basis 
the following table represents the scheduled maturities of the company s contractual obligations as of october  in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt     operating leases    capital lease obligations    purchase obligations fixed assets   purchase obligations service contracts other   unrecognized tax liability other long term liabilities    total contractual cash obligations   for a more detailed description of the obligations see notes and to the consolidated financial statements in item hereof

the obligations related to the closed store leases are discussed below 
amounts are not offset by expected sublease income and do not include various contingent liabilities associated with assigned leases as discussed below 
for a more detailed description of the obligation refer to note to the consolidated financial statements in item hereof 
the timing of payment  if any  for the unrecognized tax liability is not certain 
however  we believe that we could possibly be assessed on the tax issues within the next three years 
represents the projected cash payments associated with certain deferred compensation contracts 
the net present value of these obligations is recorded by the company and included with other long term liabilities in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the table above excludes funding of the harris teeter supermarkets  inc employees pension plan the pension plan  payments pursuant to the supplemental executive retirement plan the serp and payments pursuant to the company s flexible deferred compensation and survivor benefit plans 
the company s funding policy in regards to the pension plan is to contribute annually the amount required by regulatory authorities to meet minimum funding requirements and an amount to increase the funding ratios over future years to a level determined by the company s actuaries to be effective in reducing the volatility of contributions 
however  the timing and amount of such contributions or payments may be impacted by a number of factors  including government regulation  returns on plan assets and actuarial assumptions regarding our future funding obligations 
the company was not required to make a contribution to the pension plan in fiscal  however  the company contributed million during fiscal payments made pursuant to the serp  flexible deferred compensation and survivor benefit plans are not required to be funded in advance  and are equal to the benefit payments made during the year 
actual payments will be based on various external factors such as retirement dates and mortality 
annual payments pursuant to the serp are expected to range between million and million over the next five years 
benefit payments for the flexible deferred compensation plan or survivor benefit plan cannot be reasonably estimated due to the various external factors noted above 
for a more detailed description of our pension obligations see note to the consolidated financial statements in item hereof 
in connection with the closing of certain store locations  the company has assigned leases to several sub tenants with recourse 
these leases expire over the next years  and the future minimum lease payments of approximately million  in the aggregate  over that future period have been assumed by these sub tenants 
in the unlikely event  in management s opinion based on the current operations and credit worthiness of the assignees  that all such contingent obligations would be payable by the company  the approximate aggregate amounts due by year would be as follows million in fiscal stores  million in fiscal stores  million in fiscal stores  million in fiscal stores  million in fiscal stores and million in aggregate during all remaining years thereafter 
the company utilizes various standby letters of credit and bonds as required from time to time by certain programs  most significantly for self insured programs such as workers compensation and various casualty insurance 
these letters of credit and bonds do not represent additional obligations of the company since the underlying liabilities are recorded as insurance reserves and included with other current liabilities on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  the company occasionally utilizes documentary letters of credit for the purchase of merchandise in the normal course of business 
issued and outstanding letters of credit totaled million as of october  off balance sheet arrangements the company is not a party to any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  management s determination of estimates and judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities requires the exercise of judgment in the selection and application of assumptions based on various factors including historical experience  current and expected economic conditions and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company constantly reviews the relevant  significant factors and makes adjustments where the facts and circumstances dictate 
management has identified the following accounting policies as the most critical in the preparation of the company s financial statements because they involve the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
vendor rebates  credits and promotional allowances consistent with standard practices in the retail industry  the company receives allowances from vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements 
given the highly promotional nature of the retail supermarket industry  the allowances are generally intended to defray the costs of promotion  advertising and selling the vendor s products 
examples of such arrangements include  but are not limited to  promotional  markdown and rebate allowances  cooperative advertising funds  volume allowances  store opening discounts and support  and slotting  stocking and display allowances 
the amount of such allowances may be determined on the basis of a fixed dollar amount negotiated with the vendor  an amount per unit purchased or as a percentage of total purchases from the vendor  or amounts based on sales to the customer  number of stores  in store displays or advertising 
the proper recognition and timing of accounting for these items are significant to the reporting of the results of operations of the company 
the company applies the authoritative guidance of the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 
revenue recognition  subtopic of the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  and other authoritative guidance as appropriate 
under sab no 
 revenue recognition requires  as a prerequisite  the completion of the earnings process and its realization or assurance of realizability 
vendor rebates  credits and other promotional allowances that relate to harris teeter s buying and merchandising activities  including lump sum payments associated with long term contracts  are recorded as a component of cost of sales as they are earned  the recognition of which is determined in accordance with the underlying agreement with the vendor  the authoritative guidance and completion of the earning process 
portions of vendor allowances that are refundable to the vendor  in whole or in part  by the nature of the provisions of the contract are deferred from recognition until realization is reasonably assured 
the company s practices are in accordance with asc subtopic and are based on the premise that the accounting for these vendor allowances should follow the economic substance of the underlying transactions  which is evidenced by the agreement with the vendor as long as the allowance is distinguishable from the merchandise purchase 
consistent with this premise  the company recognizes allowances when the purpose for which the vendor funds were intended and committed to be used has been fulfilled and a cost has been incurred by the retailer 
thus  it is the company s policy to recognize the vendor allowance consistent with the timing of the recognition of the expense that the allowance is intended to reimburse and to determine the accounting classification consistent with the economic substance of the underlying transaction 
where the company provides an identifiable benefit or service to the vendor apart from the purchase of merchandise  that transaction is recorded separately 
for example  co operative advertising allowances are accounted for as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising cost is incurred 
if the advertising allowance exceeds the cost of advertising  then the excess is recorded against the cost of sales in the period in which the related expense is recognized 
there are numerous types of rebates and allowances in the retail industry 
the company s accounting practices with regard to some of the more typical arrangements are discussed as follows 
vendor allowances for price markdowns are credited to the cost of sales during the period in which the related markdown was taken and charged to the cost of sales 
slotting and stocking allowances received from a vendor to ensure that its products are carried or to introduce a new product at the company s stores are recorded as a reduction of cost of sales over the period covered by the agreement with the vendor based on the estimated inventory turns of the merchandise to which the allowance applies 
display allowances are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales in the period earned in accordance with the vendor agreement based on the estimated inventory turns of the merchandise to which the allowance applies 
volume rebates by the vendor in the form of a reduction of the purchase price of the merchandise reduce the cost of sales when the related merchandise is sold 
generally  volume rebates under a structured purchase program with allowances awarded based on the level of purchases are recognized  when realization is assured  as a reduction in the cost of sales in the appropriate monthly period based on the actual level of purchases in the period relative to the total purchase commitment and adjusted for the estimated inventory turns of the merchandise 
some of these typical vendor rebate  credit and promotional allowance arrangements require that the company make assumptions and judgments regarding  for example  the likelihood of attaining specified levels of purchases or selling specified volumes of products  the duration of carrying a specified product and the estimation of inventory turns 
vendor allowances that have not been earned are recorded as either unearned revenue or as an offset to the carrying value of inventory and totaled million and million as of october   and october   respectively 
the company constantly reviews the relevant  significant factors and makes adjustments where the facts and circumstances dictate 
historically  the company s assumptions and judgments regarding vendor rebates  credits and promotional allowances have been reasonably accurate 
management believes that future changes in these assumptions and judgments are not reasonably likely to have a material effect on the company s financial condition and results of operation 
inventory valuation merchandise inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market with the cost of a substantial portion of inventories being determined using the last in  first out lifo method 
limited categories of inventories are valued on the first in  first out fifo cost methods 
in total  approximately of inventories were valued using the lifo method in both fiscal and fiscal cost for the balance of the inventories was determined using the fifo method 
the excess of estimated current costs over the lifo carrying value  or lifo reserve  was approximately million and million as of october  and october   respectively 
lifo assumes that the last costs in are the ones that should be used to measure the cost of goods sold  leaving the earlier costs residing in the ending inventory valuation 
the company uses the link chain method of computing dollar value lifo whereby the base year values of beginning and ending inventories are determined using a cumulative price index 
the company generates an estimated internal index to link current costs to the original costs of the base years in which the company adopted lifo 
the company s determination of the lifo index is driven by the change in current year costs  as well as the change in inventory quantities on hand 
under the lifo valuation method  all retail store inventories are initially stated at estimated cost as calculated by the retail inventory method rim 
under rim  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
rim is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
inherent in the rim calculation are certain significant management judgments and estimates  including markups  markdowns  lost inventory shrinkage percentages and the purity and similarity of inventory sub categories as to their relative inventory turns  gross margins and on hand quantities 
these judgments and estimates can significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost  as well as gross margin 
management believes that the company s rim provides an inventory valuation which reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying the inventory at the lower of cost or market 
historically  the company s assumptions and judgments regarding the company s rim have been reasonably accurate 
management does not believe that the likelihood is significant that materially higher lifo reserves are required given its current expectations of on hand inventory quantities and costs 
the proper valuation of inventory also requires management to estimate the net realizable value of the company s obsolete and slow moving inventory at the end of each period 
management bases its net realizable values upon many factors including historical recovery rates  the aging of inventories on hand  the inventory movement of specific products and the current economic conditions 
when management has determined inventory to be obsolete or slow moving  the inventory is reduced to its net realizable value by recording an obsolescence reserve 
given the company s experiences in selling obsolete and slow moving inventory  management believes that the historical estimates used to value obsolete and slow moving inventory have been reasonably accurate 
with regard to the proper valuations of inventories  management reviews its judgments  assumptions and other relevant  significant factors on a routine basis and makes adjustments where the facts and circumstances dictate 
self insurance accruals for workers compensation  healthcare and general liability the company is primarily self insured for workers compensation claims  healthcare claims and general liability and automotive liability losses 
the company has purchased insurance coverage in order to establish certain limits to its exposure on a per claim basis 
the company s self insurance accruals for workers compensation insurance and general liability insurance totaled million and million as of october  and october   respectively 
actual workers compensation claims  and general liability and automotive liability losses  are reported to the company by third party administrators 
the third party administrators also report initial estimates of related loss 
the open claims and initial loss estimates are subjected to examination by the company s risk management and accounting management utilizing a consistent methodology which involves various assumptions  judgment and other factors 
such factors include but are not limited to the probability of settlement  the amount at which settlement can be achieved  the probable duration of the claim  the cost development pattern of the claim and the applicable cost development factor 
the company determines the estimated accruals required for worker compensation claims in each accounting period 
this requires that management determine estimates of the costs of claims incurred and accrue for such expenses in the period in which the claims are incurred 
the company measures the liabilities associated with claims for workers compensation  general liability and automotive liability through the use of actuarial methods to project an estimate of ultimate cost for claims incurred 
the estimated cost for claims incurred are discounted to present values using a discount rate representing a return on high quality fixed income securities with an average maturity equal to the average payout of the related liability 
a basis point decrease in the discount rate would not significantly increase the estimated liabilities 
the company constantly reviews the relevant  significant factors and makes adjustments where the facts and circumstances dictate 
the variety of healthcare plans available to employees are primarily self insured 
the company records an accrual for the estimated amount of self insured healthcare claims incurred by all participants but not yet reported ibnr using an actuarial method of applying a development factor to the reported claims amount 
the most significant factors which impact on the determination of the required accrual are the historical pattern of the timeliness of claims processing  changes in the nature or types of benefit plans  changes in the plan benefit designs  employer employee cost sharing factors  and medical trends and inflation 
the company s total accrual for self insured healthcare claims totaled million and million as of october  and october   respectively 
historical experience is continually monitored  and accruals are adjusted when warranted by changes in facts and circumstances 
management believes that the use of actuarial studies to determine self insurance reserves represents a consistent method of measuring these subjective estimates 
impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets and closed store obligations the company assesses its goodwill and other long lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount to the net non discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of net book value over the estimated fair value of the asset impaired 
the fair value is estimated based on expected future cash flows 
the value of property and equipment associated with closed stores and facilities is adjusted to reflect recoverable values based on the company s prior history of disposing of similar assets and current economic conditions 
management continually reviews its fair value estimates and records impairment charges for assets held for sale when management determines  based on new information which it believes to be reliable  that such charges are appropriate 
the results of impairment tests are subject to management s estimates and assumptions of projected cash flows and operating results 
the company believes that  based on current estimates and assumptions of projected cash flows  materially different reported results are not likely to result from the impairment of goodwill or other long lived assets 
however  a change in assumptions or market conditions could result in a change in estimated future cash flows and the likelihood of materially different reported results 
the company records liabilities for closed stores that are under long term lease agreements 
the liability represents an estimate of the present value of the remaining non cancelable lease payments after the anticipated closing date  net of estimated subtenant income 
the closed store liabilities usually are paid over the lease terms associated with the closed stores  unless settled earlier 
management estimates the subtenant income and future cash flows based on its historical experience and knowledge of the market in which the store is located  the results of its previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and the current economic conditions 
the actual cost of disposition for these leases is affected by specific real estate markets  inflation rates and general economic conditions and may differ significantly from those assumed and estimated 
store closings generally are completed within one year after the decision to close 
adjustments to closed store liabilities primarily relate to changes in subtenants and actual costs differing from original estimates 
adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the change becomes known 
any excess store closing liability remaining upon settlement of the obligation is reversed to income in the period that such settlement is determined 
the company periodically reviews the relevant  significant factors used in its estimates and makes adjustments where the facts and circumstances dictate 
the company s closed store reserve amounted to million and million as of october  and october   respectively 
individual closed store reserves are likely to be adjusted up or down in the future to reflect changes in assumptions 
however  the company s historical assumptions and judgments regarding closed store reserves have been reasonably accurate 
retirement plans and post retirement benefit plans the company maintains certain retirement benefit plans for substantially all full time employees and supplemental retirement benefit plans for certain selected directors and officers of the company and its subsidiaries 
the qualified pension plan is a non contributory  funded defined benefit plan  while the non qualified supplemental retirement benefit plans are unfunded  defined benefit plans 
the company s current funding policy for its qualified pension plan is to contribute annually an amount in excess of the contributions required by regulatory authorities to meet minimum funding requirements  as determined by its actuaries to be effective in increasing the funding ratios and reducing the volatility of future contributions 
the company has certain deferred compensation arrangements which allow or allowed in prior years its directors  officers and selected key management personnel to forego the receipt of earned compensation for specified periods of time 
the company may also  from time to time  make discretionary annual contributions into the director deferral plan on behalf of its outside directors 
these plans are unfunded 
the company utilizes a rabbi trust to hold assets set aside to pay the respective liabilities of these plans

the company maintains a post retirement healthcare plan for retirees whose sum of age and years of service equal at least at retirement 
the plan continues coverage from early retirement date until the earlier date of eligibility for medicare or any other employer s medical plan 
the company requires that the retiree pay the estimated full cost of the coverage 
the company also provides a  post retirement mortality benefit to a small number of retirees under a prior plan 
the obligations and expenses associated with each of these benefit plans are not material 
the determination of the company s obligation and expense for pension  deferred compensation and other post retirement benefits is dependent on certain assumptions selected by management and used by the company and its actuaries in calculating such amounts 
the more significant of those assumptions applicable to the qualified pension plan include the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  the rates of increase in future compensation and the rates of future employee turnover 
those assumptions also apply to determinations of the obligations and expense of the following plans  except as noted supplemental pension no funded assets to be measured  and deferred compensation arrangement and post retirement mortality benefit no funded assets to be measured and no dependency on future rates of compensation or turnover 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  actual results that differ from management s assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect the company s recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
while management believes that its selections of values for the various assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in the assumptions may materially affect pension and other post retirement obligations and future expense
