item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  reflecting our plans and objectives that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those discussed in the section entitled risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview we are the leading marketer and producer of low carbon renewable fuels in the western united states 
we market all the ethanol produced by the pacific ethanol plants  all the ethanol produced by three other ethanol producers in the western united states and ethanol purchased from other third party suppliers throughout the united states 
we also market ethanol co products  including wdg  for the pacific ethanol plants 
we have extensive customer relationships throughout the western united states 
our ethanol customers are integrated oil companies and gasoline marketers who blend ethanol into gasoline 
we arrange for transportation  storage and delivery of ethanol purchased by our customers through our agreements with third party service providers in the western united states  primarily in california  arizona  nevada  utah  oregon  colorado  idaho and washington 
our wdg customers are dairies and feedlots located near the pacific ethanol plants 
we have extensive supplier relationships throughout the western and midwestern united states 
in some cases  we have marketing agreements with suppliers to market all of the output of their facilities 
we hold a ownership interest in new pe holdco which indirectly owns the pacific ethanol plants through its ownership of the plant owners 
we operate and maintain the pacific ethanol plants under the terms of an asset management agreement with new pe holdco and the plant owners 
we also market ethanol and wdg produced by the pacific ethanol plants under the terms of separate marketing agreements with the plant owners whose facilities are operational 
in addition  we provide operations  maintenance and accounting services for a  gallon per year cellulosic integrated biorefinery owned by zeachem inc in boardman  oregon  which is adjacent to the pacific ethanol columbia plant 
the pacific ethanol plants are comprised of the four facilities described immediately below  three of which are currently operational 
when market conditions permit  and with approval of new pe holdco  we intend to resume operations at the madera  california facility 
facility name facility location estimated annual capacity gallons current operating status magic valley burley  id operating columbia boardman  or operating stockton stockton  ca operating madera madera  ca idled we earn fees as follows under our asset management and other agreements with new pe holdco and the plant owners ethanol marketing fees of approximately of the net sales price  but not less than per gallon and not more than per gallon  corn procurement and handling fees of per bushel  wdg fees of of the third party purchase price  but not less than per ton and not more than per ton  and asset management fees of  per month for each operating facility and  per month for each idled facility 
we intend to maintain and advance our position as the leading marketer and producer of low carbon renewable fuels in the western united states  in part by expanding our relationships with customers and third party ethanol producers to market higher volumes of ethanol and by expanding the market for ethanol by continuing to work with state governments to encourage the adoption of policies and standards that promote ethanol as a fuel additive and transportation fuel 
further  we may seek to provide management services for other third party ethanol production facilities in the western united states 
financial performance summary consolidation we consolidate new pe holdco s financial results due to the nature of our ownership in and control over new pe holdco 
however  since we do not wholly own new pe holdco  we must adjust our consolidated net income loss for the income loss attributed to new pe holdco s other owners 
this adjustment results in net income loss attributed to pacific ethanol  inc see results of operations accounting for the results of new pe holdco below 
summary our consolidated net sales increased by  or million  to million for from million for our net income attributed to pacific ethanol  inc decreased by million to million for from million for  the latter of which included a million gain related to the plant owners exit from bankruptcy in factors that contributed to our results of operations for include net sales 
the increase in our net sales for as compared to was primarily due to the following combination of factors o higher sales volumes 
total volume of ethanol sold increased by to million gallons for from million gallons for this increase in sales volume is due to an increase in both production and third party gallons sold 
in  three pacific ethanol plants were operating for the full year  whereas in  only two pacific ethanol plants were operating most of the year 
o higher ethanol prices 
our average sales price of ethanol increased to per gallon for as compared to per gallon for o consolidation of new pe holdco 
in  we consolidated the results of new pe holdco for the entire year  whereas in  we did not consolidate new pe holdco s results for the three months ended september  for this period we included only our net marketing fees associated with sales volumes from the pacific ethanol plants 
as a result  our net sales were lower by million for gross margin 
our gross margin improved to for from negative for the improvement in gross margin was primarily the result of improved operating margins at the pacific ethanol plants 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses  or sg a  increased by million to million for  as compared to million for  primarily as a result of increases in payroll and benefits  taxes and permits  amortization of intangibles  rent expense and professional fees  which were partially offset by decreases in noncash compensation expense 
fair value adjustments on convertible notes and warrants 
we issued convertible notes and warrants in for million in cash 
in addition  we issued warrants in december these instruments were recorded at fair value  with quarterly adjustments for their fair value  resulting in a charge to net income of million for as compared to a charge of million for interest expense 
our interest expense increased by million to million for from million for this increase is primarily due to increased average debt balances related to our convertible notes and line of credit facilities 
other income expense 
our other income expense decreased by million to an expense of million for from income of million for this decrease is primarily due to a gain of million associated with our purchase of a ownership interest in new pe holdco in gain from bankruptcy exit 
on june   the plant owners exited from bankruptcy  resulting in the removal of million in net liabilities from our balance sheet  which was recorded as a gain for sales and margins we generate sales by marketing all the ethanol produced by the pacific ethanol plants  all the ethanol produced by three other ethanol producers in the western united states and ethanol purchased from other third party suppliers throughout the united states 
we also market ethanol co products  including wdg  for the pacific ethanol plants 
our profitability is highly dependent on various commodity prices  including the market prices of ethanol  corn and natural gas 
average ethanol sales prices increased in as compared to the average price of ethanol  as reported by the chicago board of trade  or cbot  increased by to for from for however  over a period of four weeks at the end of  the market price of ethanol declined by approximately 
the increase in the price of ethanol during was primarily due to an increase in crude oil prices 
the significant drop in the price of ethanol at the end of was due to a substantial drop in demand for gasoline  of which ethanol is a primary blend stock component 
average corn prices also increased in as compared to specifically  the average price of corn  as reported by the cbot  increased by to for from for we have three principal methods of selling ethanol as a merchant  as a producer and as an agent 
see critical accounting policies revenue recognition below 
when acting as a merchant or as a producer  we generally enter into sales contracts to ship ethanol to a customer s desired location 
we support these sales contracts through purchase contracts with several third party suppliers or through our own production 
we manage the necessary logistics to deliver ethanol to our customers either directly from a third party supplier or from our inventory via truck or rail 
our sales as a merchant or as a producer expose us to significant price risks resulting from potential fluctuations in the market price of ethanol and corn 
our exposure varies depending on the magnitude of our sales and purchase commitments compared to the magnitude of our existing inventory  as well as the pricing terms such as market index or fixed pricing of our contracts 
we seek to mitigate our exposure to price risks by implementing appropriate risk management strategies 
when acting as an agent for third party suppliers  we conduct back to back purchases and sales in which we match ethanol purchase and sale contracts of like quantities and delivery periods 
when acting in this capacity  we receive a predetermined service fee and have little or no exposure to price risks resulting from potential fluctuations in the market price of ethanol 
for these sales  we record the marketing fee as net sales 
we believe that our gross profit margins depend primarily on five key factors the market price of ethanol  which we believe will be impacted by the degree of competition in the ethanol market  the price of gasoline and related petroleum products  and government regulation  including government mandates  the market price of key production input commodities  including corn and natural gas  the market price of wdg  our ability to anticipate trends in the market price of ethanol  wdg  and key input commodities and implement appropriate risk management and opportunistic strategies  and the proportion of our sales of ethanol produced at the pacific ethanol plants to our sales of ethanol produced by unrelated third parties 
we seek to optimize our gross profit margins by anticipating the factors above and  when resources are available  implementing hedging transactions and taking other actions designed to limit risk and address these factors 
for example  we may seek to decrease inventory levels in anticipation of declining ethanol prices and increase inventory levels in anticipation of increasing ethanol prices 
we may also seek to alter our proportion or timing  or both  of purchase and sales commitments 
our limited resources to act upon the anticipated factors described above and or our inability to anticipate these factors or their relative importance  and adverse movements in the factors themselves  could result in declining or even negative gross profit margins over certain periods of time 
our ability to anticipate these factors or favorable movements in these factors may enable us to generate above average gross profit margins 
however  given the difficulty associated with successfully forecasting any of these factors  we are unable to estimate our future gross profit margins 
results of operations accounting for the results of new pe holdco our consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of new pe holdco  which in turn include the financial statements of the plant owners  for all periods except for the three months ended september  on june   the plant owners emerged from bankruptcy  and the ownership of the plant owners was transferred to new pe holdco 
accordingly  for the three months ended september   we did not consolidate new pe holdco s or the plant owners financial results as we had no ownership interest in the plant owners or new pe holdco during the period and we did not have the obligation to absorb losses or a right to receive benefits from new pe holdco that could potentially be significant to new pe holdco 
also  under the plan  we removed the plant owners assets of million and liabilities of million from our balance sheet  resulting in a net gain of million for on october   we purchased a ownership interest in new pe holdco  which gave us the single largest equity position in new pe holdco 
based on our ownership interest as well as our asset management and marketing agreements with new pe holdco  we determined that  beginning on october   we were the primary beneficiary of new pe holdco  and as such  we resumed consolidating new pe holdco s financial results with our financial results beginning in the fourth quarter of since then  we have further increased our ownership interest in new pe holdco to 
selected financial information the following selected financial information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  and the other sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained in this report 
certain performance metrics that we believe are important indicators of our results of operations include years ended december  percentage variance production gallons sold in millions third party gallons sold in millions total gallons sold in millions average sales price per gallon corn cost per bushel cbot equivalent co product revenues as of delivered cost of corn average cbot ethanol price per gallon average cbot corn price per bushel we exclude transportation or basis costs in our corn costs to calculate a cbot equivalent in order to more appropriately compare our corn costs to average cbot corn prices 
co product revenues as percentage of delivered cost of corn shows our yield based on sales of wdg generated from ethanol we produced 
prices for exclude the three months ended september   as the activities of the pacific ethanol plants were not consolidated in our financial results 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  years ended dollar variance percentage variance results as a percentage of net sales for the years ended december  favorable favorable december  unfavorable unfavorable dollars in thousands net sales cost of goods sold gross profit loss selling  general and administrative expenses income loss from operations fair value adjustments on convertible notes and warrants loss on investment in front range loss on extinguishments of debt interest expense other income expense  net loss before reorganization costs  gain from bankruptcy exit  provision for income taxes and noncontrolling interest in variable interest entities reorganization costs gain from bankruptcy exit provision for income taxes consolidated net income loss net loss attributed to noncontrolling interest in variable interest entities net income attributed to pacific ethanol  inc preferred stock dividends income available to common stockholders not meaningful 
net sales the increase in our net sales for as compared to was primarily due to an increase in total gallons sold and an increase in our average sales price per gallon 
total volume of production gallons sold increased  or million gallons  to million gallons for as compared to million gallons for the increase in production gallons sold is primarily due to our consolidation of the financial results of three pacific ethanol plants during all of  whereas in  we deconsolidated their results for the three months ended september  third party gallons sold also increased by  or million gallons  to million gallons for as compared to million gallons for the increase in third party gallons sold is primarily due to increased sales under our third party ethanol marketing arrangements 
of the total amount of third party gallons sold for the three months ended september   million gallons were attributable to the pacific ethanol plants  which partially offset the increase in net sales by million for our average sales price per gallon increased to for from for this increase in average sales price per gallon is consistent with the average cbot price per gallon  which also increased to for from for cost of goods sold and gross profit loss our gross profit loss improved to million for from a gross loss of million for primarily due to higher sales and improved commodity margins  predominately related to the spread between ethanol prices and corn and energy costs 
our gross margin increased to for as compared to negative for although corn  the single largest component of the production cost of our ethanol  increased by to per bushel  the contribution of a third pacific ethanol plant in operation helped improve our gross profit 
in addition  we were able to offset approximately million and million for and  respectively  of our production costs due to elevated corn prices with proceeds from the cepip through the pacific ethanol plants located in california  which were recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold 
for any month in which a payment is made by the cepip  we may be required to reimburse the funds within the subsequent five years from each payment date  if corn crush spreads  measured as the difference between specified ethanol and corn index prices  exceed per gallon 
to date  we have not been required to reimburse any amounts  and based on historical corn crush spreads  we do not believe we will be required to make any reimbursements in the foreseeable future 
selling  general and administrative expenses our sg a increased by million to million for as compared to million for sg a  however  decreased as a percentage of net sales due to higher sales volumes 
the dollar increase in sg a is primarily due to the following factors an increase in salaries and benefits of million due to increased headcount to support our increased sales volume  an increase in taxes and permits of million due to the restart of the stockton facility and other matters related to the pacific ethanol plants  an increase in amortization of intangibles of million due to amortization of the pacific ethanol tradename by new pe holdco  an increase in rent expense of million due to a full year of consolidating the results of new pe holdco and the pacific ethanol plants  and an increase in professional fees of million due to administrative costs incurred by new pe holdco 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in noncash compensation expense of million primarily due to a decline in the fair value of awards occurring during the year 
fair value adjustments on convertible notes and warrants we issued senior convertible notes and warrants in for million in cash 
the senior convertible notes and warrants were recorded at fair value 
we recorded a charge of million related to the original issuance and subsequent fair value adjustments of these instruments for in  we recorded gains of million related to our quarterly fair value adjustments on these instruments 
loss on investment in front range in september  we entered into an agreement to sell our entire interest in front range for million in cash 
the carrying value of our interest in front range prior to the sale was million 
as a result  we reduced our investment in front range to fair value  resulting in a charge of million 
we closed the sale of our interest in front range in october loss on extinguishments of debt we were party to agreements designed to satisfy our then outstanding debt to lyles united llc and lyles mechanical co  or collectively  lyles 
under these agreements  we issued shares to a third party which acquired outstanding debt owed to lyles in successive tranches 
during  under the terms of these agreements  we issued an aggregate of million shares of common stock  resulting in an aggregate loss of million 
interest expense interest expense increased by million to million for from million for the increase is primarily due to increased average debt balances  which includes our convertible notes and the term and line of credit facilities for new pe holdco 
in addition  the increase is related to early voluntary conversions by the holders of our convertible notes 
upon conversion  under the terms of the convertible notes  make whole interest was paid on the principal amounts converted in an amount that would have accrued had the principal amounts remained outstanding through maturity 
other income expense  net other income expense decreased by million to an expense of million for from income of million for the decrease in other income expense is primarily due to a gain of million associated with our acquisition of a ownership interest in new pe holdco  as we paid for our ownership interest at a discount to the fair value of the net assets of new pe holdco 
reorganization costs and gain from bankruptcy exit under the financial accounting standards board s accounting standards codification  reorganizations  revenues  expenses  realized gains and losses  and provisions for losses that can be directly associated with the reorganization and restructuring of our business must be reported separately as reorganization items in the statements of operations 
professional fees directly related to the reorganization include fees associated with advisors to the plant owners  unsecured creditors  secured creditors and administrative costs in complying with reporting rules under the bankruptcy code 
the plant owners reorganization costs consisted of the following in thousands december  professional fees trustee fees total as of the effective date  we no longer owned the plant owners 
as a result  we removed the net liabilities from our consolidated financial statements  resulting in a net gain from bankruptcy exit of million 
net loss attributed to noncontrolling interest in variable interest entities net loss attributed to noncontrolling interest in variable interest entities relates to the consolidated treatment of new pe holdco for the three months ended december  and for all of  and represents the noncontrolling interest of others in new pe holdco s earnings 
we consolidated new pe holdco s financial results for the applicable periods 
however  because we owned less than  we reduced our net income loss for the noncontrolling interest  which represents the remaining ownership interest that we do not own 
preferred stock dividends shares of our series b preferred stock are entitled to quarterly cumulative dividends payable in arrears in an amount equal to per annum of the purchase price per share of the series b preferred stock 
we accrued dividends of million and million for and  respectively  resulting in total accrued and unpaid dividends of million in respect of our series b preferred stock 
liquidity and capital resources during  we funded our operations primarily from cash provided by operations  borrowings under our credit facilities and the remaining proceeds from the issuance and sale of our senior convertible notes and warrants and our private placement in december on december   we raised net proceeds of approximately million through the issuance of million shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  subject to adjustment 
we had working capital of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
our current available capital resources consist of cash on hand and amounts available for borrowing under kinergy s credit facility 
in addition  new pe holdco has a credit facility for use in the operations of the pacific ethanol plants 
we expect that our future available capital resources will consist primarily of our remaining cash balances  amounts available for borrowing  if any  under kinergy s credit facility  cash generated from kinergy s ethanol marketing business  fees paid under our asset management agreement relating to our operation of the pacific ethanol plants  distributions  if any  in respect of our ownership interest in new pe holdco  and the remaining proceeds of any future debt and or equity financings 
we believe that current and future available capital resources  revenues generated from operations  and other existing sources of liquidity  including our credit facilities  will be adequate to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
if  however  our capital requirements or cash flow vary materially from our current projections  if unforeseen circumstances occur  or if we require a significant amount of cash to fund future acquisitions  we may require additional financing 
our failure to raise capital  if needed  could restrict our growth  or hinder our ability to compete 
quantitative year end liquidity status we believe that the following amounts provide insight into our liquidity and capital resources 
the following selected financial information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  and the other sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained in this report dollars in thousands as of and for the year ended december  variance cash and cash equivalents current assets total assets of variable interest entity current liabilities property and equipment  net notes payable  current portion notes payable  noncurrent portion total liabilities of variable interest entity working capital working capital ratio change in working capital and cash flows working capital increased from million at december  to million at december  as a result of a significant decrease in current liabilities of million and an increase in current assets of million 
current liabilities decreased primarily due to the retirement of our convertible notes in the principal amount of million 
current assets increased primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable and prepaid inventory  due to the timing of sales at the end of as compared to cash used in our operating activities of million resulted primarily from our consolidated net loss of million  a million gain from fair value adjustments  a million increase in prepaid inventory  a million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and a million increase in accounts receivable  partially offset by million in depreciation and amortization expense  million in interest paid in stock  million in non cash compensation and a million decrease in inventories 
cash used in our investing activities of million resulted primarily from the million purchase of additional ownership interests in new pe holdco and million in additions to property and equipment 
cash provided by our financing activities of million resulted primarily from million in net proceeds from our operating lines of credit  million in net proceeds from the issuance and sale of our common stock and warrants  partially offset by million in principal payments in cash on our convertible notes and million in principal payments on related party borrowings 
kinergy operating line of credit kinergy maintains a credit facility in the aggregate amount of up to million 
the credit facility expires on december  in may  kinergy and its lender amended and increased the credit facility to up to million  with an optional accordion feature for an additional million 
interest accrues under the credit facility at a rate equal to i the three month london interbank offered rate libor  plus ii a specified applicable margin ranging between and 
the credit facility s monthly unused line fee is of the amount by which the maximum credit under the facility exceeds the average daily principal balance 
kinergy is also required to pay customary fees and expenses associated with the credit facility and issuances of letters of credit 
in addition  kinergy is responsible for a  monthly servicing fee 
payments that may be made by kinergy to pacific ethanol as reimbursement for management and other services provided by pacific ethanol to kinergy are limited to  per fiscal quarter in and  per fiscal quarter in kinergy was required to generate quarterly earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  of  for the two consecutive quarterly periods ended december  for the fiscal quarter ending march   kinergy is required to generate quarterly ebitda of  for the fiscal quarter ending june  and each fiscal quarter thereafter  kinergy is required to generate quarterly ebitda of  and an ebitda of  for each two consecutive quarterly period 
further  for all periods commencing may  kinergy must maintain a fixed coverage ratio calculated as a twelve month rolling ebitda divided by a twelve month rolling interest expense of at least under the credit facility and is prohibited from incurring any additional indebtedness other than specific intercompany indebtedness or making any capital expenditures in excess of  absent the lender s prior consent 
kinergy s obligations under the credit facility are secured by a first priority security interest in all of its assets in favor of the lender 
the following table summarizes kinergy s financial covenants and actual results for the periods presented dollars in thousands years ended december  ebitda requirement three months n a actual n a excess n a ebitda requirement six months actual excess fixed coverage ratio requirement actual excess we have guaranteed all of kinergy s obligations under the credit facility 
as of december   kinergy had an available borrowing base under the credit facility of million and had an outstanding balance of million 
new pe holdco term debt and working capital line of credit on the effective date  approximately million in prepetition and post petition secured indebtedness of the plant owners was restructured under a credit agreement entered into on june  among the plant owners  as borrowers  and various lenders 
under the plan  the plant owners existing prepetition and post petition secured indebtedness of approximately million was restructured to consist of approximately million in three year term loans and a new three year revolving credit facility of up to million to fund working capital requirements 
the term loans and credit facility mature in june we believe that the plant owners will seek to refinance these loans prior to their stated maturity date 
as of december   new pe holdco had an outstanding letter of credit of approximately million  unused availability under the credit facility of million and an outstanding balance of million 
notes payable to related parties on march   our chairman of the board and our chief executive officer provided funds in an aggregate amount of million for general working capital purposes  in exchange for two unsecured promissory notes issued by us 
interest on the unpaid principal amounts accrues at a rate of per annum 
all principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the promissory notes was initially due and payable in march on october   we paid all accrued interest and million in principal under these notes 
on november   we paid million in principal under these notes 
as of december   the remaining amount of million was due and payable on the extended maturity date of march  on march   the maturity date was further extended to march  critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of net sales and expenses for each period 
the following represents a summary of our critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that we believe are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
we derive revenue primarily from sales of ethanol and related co products 
we recognize revenue when title transfers to our customers  which is generally upon the delivery of these products to a customer s designated location 
these deliveries are made in accordance with sales commitments and related sales orders entered into with customers either verbally or in written form 
the sales commitments and related sales orders provide quantities  pricing and conditions of sales 
in this regard  we engage in three basic types of revenue generating transactions as a producer 
sales as a producer consist of sales of our inventory produced at the pacific ethanol plants 
as a merchant 
sales as a merchant consist of sales to customers through purchases from third party suppliers in which we may or may not obtain physical control of the ethanol or co products in which shipments are directed from our suppliers to our terminals or direct to our customers but for which we accept the risk of loss in the transactions 
as an agent 
sales as an agent consist of sales to customers through purchases from third party suppliers in which the risks and rewards of inventory ownership remain with third party suppliers and we receive a predetermined service fee under these transactions 
revenue from sales of third party ethanol and its co products is recorded net of costs when we are acting as an agent between a customer and a supplier and gross when we are a principal to the transaction 
several factors are considered to determine whether we are acting as an agent or principal  most notably whether we are the primary obligor to the customer  whether we have inventory risk and related risk of loss or whether we add meaningful value to the supplier s product or service 
consideration is also given to whether we have latitude in establishing the sales price or have credit risk  or both 
when we act as an agent  we record revenues on a net basis  or our predetermined fees and any associated freight  based upon the amount of net revenues retained in excess of amounts paid to suppliers 
we record revenues based upon the gross amounts billed to our customers in transactions where we act as a producer or a merchant and obtain title to ethanol and its co products and therefore own the product and any related unmitigated inventory risk for the ethanol  regardless of whether we actually obtain physical control of the product 
consolidation of variable interest entities effective january   we adopted amended guidance surrounding a company s analysis to determine whether any of its variable interests constitute controlling financial interests in a variable interest entity 
this analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity as the enterprise that has both of the following characteristics i the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance  and ii the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity 
additionally  an enterprise is required to assess whether it has an implicit financial responsibility to ensure that a variable interest entity operates as designed when determining whether it has the power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance 
the amended guidance also requires ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
since january   we have identified front range and new pe holdco as variable interest entities 
prior to january   under the original guidance  we determined that we must consolidate front range  which owns a plant located in windsor  colorado  with an annual production capacity of up to million gallons 
under the amended guidance  we determined effective january   that we were no longer the primary beneficiary of front range and  as a result  no longer consolidated front range s results and recorded our investment in front range under the equity method of accounting 
on october   we sold our entire ownership interest in front range 
on the effective date  we determined that new pe holdco was a variable interest entity  however  we did not believe we were its primary beneficiary 
on october   upon our initial purchase of a interest in new pe holdco  we determined that we were new pe holdco s primary beneficiary and began consolidating the results of new pe holdco 
as long as we believe we are deemed the primary beneficiary of new pe holdco  we will treat new pe holdco as a consolidated subsidiary for financial reporting purposes 
these determinations will be reassessed for appropriateness at each future reporting period 
warrants carried at fair value we have recorded our and warrants at fair value 
we believe the valuation of the and warrants is a critical accounting estimate because valuation estimates obtained from third parties involve inputs other than quoted prices to value the conversion feature 
changes in such estimates  and in particular certain of the inputs to the valuation  can be volatile from period to period and may markedly impact the total mark to market on the and warrants recorded as fair value adjustments in our consolidated statements of operations 
we recorded fair value adjustments on convertible notes and warrants as a gain of million and a charge of million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
impairment of long lived and intangible assets our long lived assets have been primarily associated with the pacific ethanol plants  reflecting the original cost of construction  adjusted for any subsequent impairment 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  including property and equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of each asset could be less than the net book value of the asset 
we assess long lived assets for impairment by first determining the forecasted  undiscounted cash flows each asset is expected to generate plus the net proceeds expected from the sale of the asset 
if the amount of proceeds is less than the carrying value of the asset  we then determine the fair value of the asset 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the fair value is less than the related net book value  and an impairment expense would be recorded in the amount of the difference 
forecasts of future cash flows are judgments based on our experience and knowledge of our operations and the industries in which we operate 
these forecasts could be significantly affected by future changes in market conditions  the economic environment  including inflation  and the purchasing decisions of our customers 
we review our intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
in our review  we determine the fair value of these assets using market multiples and discounted cash flow modeling and compare it to the net book value of the acquired assets 
we did not recognize any asset impairment charges associated with the pacific ethanol plants in or allowance for doubtful accounts we sell ethanol primarily to gasoline refining and distribution companies and sell wdg to dairy operators and animal feed distributors 
we had significant concentrations of credit risk from sales of our ethanol as of december  and  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
however  those ethanol customers historically have had good credit ratings and historically we have collected amounts that were billed to those customers 
receivables from customers are generally unsecured 
we continuously monitor our customer account balances and actively pursue collections on past due balances 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for balances that appear to have specific collection issues 
our collection process is based on the age of the invoice and requires attempted contacts with the customer at specified intervals 
if after a specified number of days  we have been unsuccessful in our collection efforts  we consider recording a bad debt allowance for the balance in question 
we would eventually write off accounts included in our allowance when we have determined that collection is not likely 
the factors considered in reaching this determination are the apparent financial condition of the customer  and our success in contacting and negotiating with the customer 
we recognized a recovery of bad debt expense of million for each of the years ended december  and impact of new accounting pronouncements on may   the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update  or asu  no 
 fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs 
asu no 
was issued concurrently with international financial reporting standards  or ifrs  fair value measurements  to provide largely identical guidance about fair value measurement and disclosure requirements 
the new standards do not extend the use of fair value but  rather  provide guidance about how fair value should be applied where it already is required or permitted under ifrs or united states generally acceptable accounting principles 
this standard is effective prospectively for interim and annual periods beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
