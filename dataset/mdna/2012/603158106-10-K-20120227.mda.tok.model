during the year  we signed contracts for five new satellite pcc facilities  three in india  one in thailand and another in bangladesh  and began operation of three new satellite plants 
we now have five commercial agreements with paper mills for our fulfilltm portfolio of products 
the company also completed the expansion of three satellites in thailand  brazil and the us 
in  the company also recorded record earnings for its refractories segment 

table of contents the company s balance sheet as of december  continues to be very strong 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december  were approximately million 
our cash flows from operations were in excess of million in in addition  we had available lines of credit of million  our debt to equity ratio was very low at  and our current ratio was we face some significant risks and challenges in the future the industries we serve  primarily paper  steel  construction and automotive  have been adversely affected by the uncertain global economic climate 
although these markets have stabilized  our global business could be adversely affected by further decreases in economic activity 
our refractories segment primarily serves the steel industry 
although north american and european steel production improved and  respectively in as compared with the prior year  it remains well below levels 
in the paper industry  which is served by our paper pcc product line  production levels for printing and writing papers within north america and europe  our two largest markets were and below the prior year 
in addition  our processed minerals and specialty pcc product lines are affected by the domestic building and construction markets and the automotive market 
housing starts in averaged approximately thousand units  and were up from levels 
housing starts were at a peak rate of million units in in the automotive industry  north american car and truck production was approximately higher than the prior year  but still approximately below levels 
some of our customers may experience mill shutdowns due to further consolidations  or may face liquidity issues  or bankruptcy  which could deteriorate the aging of our accounts receivable  increase our bad debt exposure and possibly trigger impairment of assets or realignment of our businesses 
consolidations and rationalizations in the paper and steel industries concentrate purchasing power in the hands of fewer customers  increasing pricing pressure on suppliers such as minerals technologies inc most of our paper pcc sales are subject to long term contracts that may be terminated pursuant to their terms  or may be renewed on terms less favorable to us 
we are subject to volatility in pricing and supply availability of our key raw materials used in our paper pcc product line and refractory product line 
we continue to rely on china for a portion of our supply of magnesium oxide in the refractories segment  which may be subject to uncertainty in availability and cost 
fluctuations in energy costs have an impact on all of our businesses 
changes in the fair market value of our pension assets  rates of return on assets  and discount rates could continue to have a significant impact on our net periodic pension costs as well as our funding status 
as we expand our operations abroad we face the inherent risks of doing business in many foreign countries  including foreign exchange risk  import and export restrictions  and security concerns 
the company s operations  particularly in the mining and environmental areas discharges  emissions and greenhouse gases  are subject to regulation by federal  state and foreign authorities and may be subject to  and presumably will be required to comply with  additional laws  regulations and guidelines which may be adopted in the future 
during the second quarter of  m real corporation announced plans to divest its alizay paper mill in france 
over the past several months  m real has been in discussions with a number of paper producers  however none of the candidates have fulfilled m real s conditions for sale 
although the paper mill is presently not operating  we believe discussions for the sale of the mill continue 
if m real terminates its operations at the alizay paper mill  the company would likely shut down its pcc satellite facility and could incur an impairment of assets charge 
under that scenario  the company could pursue options for mitigation or recovery of assets  including redeployment of assets to other locations to the extent feasible 
the net book value of the facility as of december  is million 
annual sales at alizay were approximately million 
during the third quarter of  newpage corporation filed for chapter bankruptcy protection 
the company does business with five newpage mills  including operating three satellite pcc facilities at newpage locations 
at present  the company continues to supply pcc to these mills 
if newpage is unable to emerge from the bankruptcy process or should these facilities cease operations  the company could incur an impairment of assets charge of up to million and may incur additional provisions for bad debt 
annual sales to newpage locations in were approximately million 
the company has evaluated these facilities for impairment of assets and  based upon the information currently available and probability weighted cash flows of various potential outcomes  has determined that no impairment charge is required in the fourth quarter 
during the third quarter of  upm kymmene announced its intention to permanently reduce paper capacity at several locations in europe by the end of the company operated a pcc satellite facility at one of these locations at anjalankoski  finland  which ceased operations in the fourth quarter of the company accelerated depreciation of the assets at this location  which had a net book value of million at the time of the announcement  over the last four months of the year 
sales at the company s satellite at anjalankoski for were approximately million

the company recorded provision for taxes on income of million in as compared to a benefit of million in the previous year 
the effective tax rate for was as compared with a tax benefit of in the previous year 
the increase in the tax over the previous year primarily relates to the decrease in the tax benefit of depletion as a percentage of earnings as well as the geographical mix of earnings 
the factors having the most significant impact on our effective tax rates in recent periods are the reversal of tax reserves as a result of a tax court case settlement  percentage depletion  restructuring and impairments  and the rate differential related to foreign earnings indefinitely invested

outlook looking forward  we remain cautious about the state of the global economy  particularly in europe  and the impact it will have on our product lines 
although we saw market stabilization and improvement in  which continued in  there remains uncertainty as to the sustainability of the upturn 
in  we plan to focus on the following growth strategies develop multiple high filler technologies  such as filler fiber  under the fulfilltm platform of products  to increase the fill rate in freesheet paper and continue to progress with commercial discussions and full scale paper machine trials

liquidity and capital resources cash flows provided from operations in were used principally to fund million of capital expenditures  and repurchase million in treasury shares 
cash provided from operating activities totaled million in as compared with million in the decrease in cash from operating activities was primarily due to higher income tax payments

trade working capital is defined as trade accounts receivable  trade accounts payable and inventories 
our total days of trade working capital decreased to days from days in reflecting the improvements in working capital management within both business segments 
the funding status of the company s pension plans was approximately at december  l and we have met all minimum funding requirements 
the funding status at decmber  was 
the reduction in our funding status was due to a large increase in the projected benefit obligation from a change in the discount rate

this program has been completed 
 shares were repurchased under this program at an average price of approximately per share 
in  the company s board of directors authorized the company s management to repurchase  at its discretion  up to million of additional shares over a two year period upon completion of the prior program 
as of december    shares have been repurchased under this program at an average price of approximately per share 
on january   the company s board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend on its common stock of per share 
no dividend will be payable unless declared by the board and unless funds are legally available for payment thereof 

table of contents the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  contractual obligations payments due by period millions of dollars total less than year years years after years debt operating lease obligations total contractual obligations we have million in uncommitted short term bank credit lines  of which million was in use at december  the credit lines are primarily in the us  with approximately million or outside the us 
the credit lines are generally one year in term at competitive market rates at large well established institutions 
the company typically uses its available credit lines to fund working capital requirements or local capital spending needs 
at the present time  we have no indication that the financial institutions would be unable to commit to these lines of credit should the need arise 
we anticipate that capital expenditures for should be between million to million  principally related to the construction of pcc plants and other opportunities that meet our strategic growth objectives 
we expect to meet our other long term financing requirements from internally generated funds  uncommitted bank credit lines and  where appropriate  project financing of certain satellite plants 
the aggregate maturities of long term debt are as follows million  million  million  million  million  thereafter million 
the company s debt to capital ratio is  which is well below the only financial covenant ratio in its debt agreements 
the company has contingent obligations associated with unrecognized tax benefits  including interest and penalties  of approximately million 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of inventories  valuation of long term assets  goodwill and other intangible assets  pension plan assumptions  income taxes  asset retirement obligations  income tax valuation allowances  stock based compensation  and litigation and environmental liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that cannot readily be determined from other sources 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition revenue from sale of products is recognized at the time the goods are shipped and title passes to the customer 
in most of our pcc contracts  the price per ton is based upon the total number of tons sold to the customer during the year 
under those contracts  the price billed to the customer for shipments during the year is based on periodic estimates of the total annual volume that will be sold to the customer 
revenues are adjusted at the end of each year to reflect the actual volume sold 
there were no significant revenue adjustments in the fourth quarter of and  respectively 
we have consignment arrangements with certain customers in our refractories segment 
revenues for these transactions are recorded when the consigned products are consumed by the customer 
revenues from sales of equipment are recorded upon completion of installation and receipt of customer acceptance 
revenues from services are recorded when the services are performed 
allowance for doubtful accounts substantially all of our accounts receivable are due from companies in the paper  construction and steel industries 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
such allowance is established through a charge to the provision for bad debt expenses 
we recorded bad debt expenses of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in addition to specific allowances established for bankrupt customers  we also analyze the collection history and financial condition of our other customers considering current industry conditions and determine whether an allowance needs to be established or adjusted 

table of contents property  plant and equipment  goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets property  plant and equipment are depreciated over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period that the assets can generate revenue  which does not necessarily coincide with the remaining term of a customer s contractual obligation to purchase products made using those assets 
our sales of pcc are predominately pursuant to long term evergreen contracts  initially ten years in length  with paper mills at which we operate satellite pcc plants 
the terms of many of these agreements have been extended  often in connection with an expansion of the satellite pcc plant 
failure of a pcc customer to renew an agreement or continue to purchase pcc from our facility could result in an impairment of assets or accelerated depreciation at such facility 
valuation of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets we assess the possible impairment of long lived assets and identifiable amortizable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  market capitalization below invested capital 
the goodwill balance for each reporting unit as of december  and  respectively  was as follows in millions december  december  pcc processed minerals refractories total annually  the company performs a qualitative assessment for each of its reproting units to determine if the two steo process for impairment is required 
if the company determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the company then evaluates the recoverability of goodwill using a two step impairment test approach at the reporting unit level 
step one involves a developing the fair value of total invested capital of each reporting unit in which goodwill is assigned  and b comparing the fair value of total invested capital for each reporting unit to its carrying amount  to determine if there is goodwill impairment 
should the carrying amount for a reporting unit exceed its fair value  then the step one test is failed  and the magnitude of any goodwill impairment is determined under step two 
the amount of impairment loss is determined in step two by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill 
the company has three reporting units  pcc  processed minerals and refractories 
we identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results of those components 
in the fourth quarter of  the company performed a qualitative assessment of its reporting units and determined it was not more likely than not that the fair value of each of its reporting units was less than their carrying values 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations 
deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years 
such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  as well as from net operating loss 
we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources  including reversal of taxable temporary differences and forecasted operating earnings 
these sources of income inherently rely 
table of contents heavily on estimates 
we use our historical experience and business forecasts to provide insight 
amounts recorded for deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowances  were million and million at december  and  respectively 
such year end amounts are expected to be fully recoverable within the applicable statutory expiration periods 
to the extent we do not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered  a valuation allowance is established 
the application of income tax law is inherently complex 
laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous 
as such  we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures 
interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time 
as such  changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations 
see note to the condensed consolidated financial statements  income taxes  for additional detail on our uncertain tax positions 
pension benefits we sponsor pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering the majority of employees who meet eligibility requirements 
several statistical and actuarial models which attempt to estimate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans 
these models include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by us  within certain guidelines 
our assumptions reflect our historical experience and management s best judgment regarding future expectations 
in addition  our actuarial consultants also use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate these assumptions 
the actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants  among other things 
differences from these assumptions may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension expense liability recorded by us follows a one percentage point change in our major assumptions would have the following effects effect on expense millions of dollars discount rate salary scale return on asset increase decrease effect on projected benefit obligation millions of dollars discount rate salary scale increase decrease the investment strategy for pension plan assets is to maintain a broadly diversified portfolio designed to both preserve and grow plan assets to meet future plan obligations 
the company s average rate of return on assets from inception through december  was over 
the company s assets are strategically allocated among equity  debt and other investments to achieve a diversification level that dampens fluctuations in investment returns 
the company s long term investment strategy is an investment portfolio mix of approximately in equity securities and in fixed income securities 
as of december   the company had approximately of its pension assets in equity securities and in fixed income securities 
asset retirement obligations we currently record the obligation for estimated asset retirement costs at a fair value in the period incurred 
factors such as expected costs and expected timing of settlement can affect the fair value of the obligations 
a revision to the estimated costs or expected timing of settlement could result in an increase or decrease in the total obligation which would change the amount of amortization and accretion expense recognized in earnings over time 
a one percent increase or decrease in the discount rate would change the total obligation by approximately million 
a one percent increase or decrease in the inflation rate would change the total obligation by approximately million 
stock based compensation the company uses the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options on their date of grant 
this model is based upon assumptions relating to the volatility of the stock price  the life of the option  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
of these  stock price volatility and option life require greater levels of judgment and are therefore critical accounting estimates 
we used a stock price volatility assumption based upon the historical and implied volatility of the company s stock 
we believe this is a good indicator of future  actual and implied volatilities 
for stock options granted in 
table of contents the period ended december   the company used a volatility assumption of 
the expected life calculation was based upon the observed and expected time to post vesting forfeiture and exercise 
for stock options granted during the fiscal year ended december   the company used a year life assumption 
the company believes the above critical estimates are based upon outcomes most likely to occur  however  were we to simultaneously increase or decrease the option life by one year and the volatility by basis points  recognized compensation expense would have changed approximately million in either direction for the year ended december  for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report  beginning on page f this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
inflation historically  inflation has not had a material adverse effect on us 
however  in recent years both business segments have been affected by rapidly rising raw material and energy costs 
the company and its customers will typically negotiate reasonable price adjustments in order to recover a portion of these rapidly escalating costs 
as the contracts pursuant to which we construct and operate our satellite pcc plants generally adjust pricing to reflect increases in costs resulting from inflation  there is a time lag before such price adjustments can be implemented 
cyclical nature of customers businesses the bulk of our sales are to customers in the paper manufacturing  steel manufacturing and construction industries  which have historically been cyclical 
the pricing structure of some of our long term pcc contracts makes our pcc business less sensitive to declines in the quantity of product purchased 
however  we cannot predict the economic outlook in the countries in which we do business  nor in the key industries we serve 
recently issued accounting standards in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu  amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs  an amendment to fasb asc topic  fair value measurement 
the amendment revises the application of the valuation premise of highest and best use of an asset  the application of premiums and discounts for fair value determination  as well as the required disclosures for transfers between level and level fair value measures and the highest and best use of nonfinancial assets 
the amendment requires additional disclosures regarding level fair value measurements and clarifies certain other existing disclosure requirements 
the asu is effective for the company for interim and annual periods beginning after december  the company does not expect the impact of adopting this asu to have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued asu  presentation of comprehensive income 
under this guidance  an entity has the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
under both options  an entity will be required to present each component of net income along with total net income  each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income  and a total amount for comprehensive income 
this asu eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the amendments in this asu do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income 
this asu is effective for the company for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  the amendments under this guidance will be applied retrospectively 
in december  the fasb issued asu  deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 
 which deferred the requirement to present on the face of the financial statements reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income while the fasb further deliberates this aspect of the proposal 
asu  as amended by asu  is effective for the company on january  although adopting the guidance will not impact our accounting for comprehensive income  it will affect our presentation of components of comprehensive income by eliminating the historical practice of showing these items within our consolidated statements of shareholders equity 
in september  the fasb issued asu  testing goodwill for impairment 
under this guidance  an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  
table of contents performing the two step impairment test is not required 
the guidance does not change how an entity measures a goodwill impairment loss  and is therefore not expected to affect the information reported to users of an entity s financial statements 
asu is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  with early adoption permitted 
the company early adopted the provisions of the guidance and conducted a qualitative analysis and determined the two step process was not needed at this time 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may have an impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in market prices and foreign currency and interest rates 
we are exposed to market risk because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar 
we do not anticipate that near term changes in exchange rates will have a material impact on our future earnings or cash flows 
however  there can be no assurance that a sudden and significant change in the value of foreign currencies would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
approximately of our bank debt bears interest at variable rates  therefore our results of operations would only be affected by interest rate changes to such bank debt outstanding 
an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our results of operations over the next fiscal year 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
when appropriate  we enter into derivative financial instruments  such as forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps  to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and interest rate movements on our operating results 
the counterparties are major financial institutions 
such forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps would not subject us to additional risk from exchange rate or interest rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts would offset losses and gains on the assets  liabilities  and transactions being hedged 
we had open forward exchange contracts to purchase approximately million and million of foreign currencies as of december  and  respectively 
these contracts matured in january the fair value of these instruments at december  and december  was a liability of less than million and million  respectively 
in  the company entered into forward contracts to sell million euros as a hedge of its net investment in europe 
these contracts mature in october the fair value of these instruments at december  was an asset of million 
the fair value of these instruments at december  was an asset of million
