overview starbucks results for fiscal reflect the strength of our global business model 
we continue to execute on our new regional operating model which we implemented at the beginning of fiscal we now have four reportable operating segments americas  europe  middle east  and africa emea  china asia pacific cap and channel development 
each segment is managed by an operating segment president 
total net revenues increased to billion driven by global comparable store sales growth of and a increase in channel development revenue 
this growth drove increased sales leverage and resulted in higher operating margin and net earnings compared to fiscal this helped mitigate the impact of higher commodity costs  mostly coffee  which negatively impacted operating income by approximately million for the year  equivalent to approximately basis points of impact on operating margin 
our americas business continued its strong momentum and contributed of total net revenues in fiscal the revenue growth for the year was driven by an increase in comparable store sales  comprised of a increase in traffic and a increase in average ticket 
this sales growth  combined with a continued focus on operational efficiencies  drove increased sales leverage that offset the impact of higher commodity costs 
looking forward  we expect to continue driving sales growth and profitability through continued store efficiency efforts  new store development  and expanding our pipeline of new product offerings to increase revenues throughout all dayparts 

table of contents emea segment results reflect both the investments we have begun making as part of our transformation plan for the region  as well as the macro economic headwinds we  and others  face there 
this resulted in flat comparable store sales and operating income of million for fiscal  a decrease of million compared to fiscal we started the year by putting in place a new leadership team that is focused on increasing the starbucks brand presence  health and relevancy across the region  improving the profitability of the existing store base through a focus on revenue growth and operating costs  and identifying opportunities for new store growth through licensing arrangements 
we expect the investments we are making as part of this transformation effort will result in improved operating performance as we progress on our plan towards mid teens operating margin  however  this turnaround will take time to gain traction 
cap segment revenues increased  driven by new store growth and comparable store sales of 
this segment continues to grow rapidly and is becoming a more meaningful contributor to overall company profitability 
we expect continued growth will be from a mix of new store openings and comparable store sales growth 
china continues to be a significant growth opportunity for us as we remain on track to reach our goal of  stores in in addition  other key markets such as japan  korea  thailand  singapore and indonesia all continue to be profitable and provide a solid foundation for continued growth in the region 
our channel development segment represents another important  profitable growth opportunity for us 
channel development results were a solid contributor to overall revenue growth with a increase in revenues primarily due to sales of starbucks and tazo branded k cup portion packs which launched at the start of fiscal and our transition to a direct distribution model for packaged coffee  which occurred during the second quarter of fiscal high commodity costs continued to be a significant drag on operating margin  however  despite these higher costs  operating income increased million to million for fiscal we expect continued innovation and new product offerings such as the verismo system by starbucks and starbucks refreshers beverages will drive further growth and profitability within this segment over time 
fiscal the view ahead for fiscal year  we expect moderate revenue growth driven by mid single digit increased comparable store sales  new store openings and strong growth in the channel development business 
licensed stores will comprise between one half and two thirds of new store openings 
we expect continued robust consolidated operating margin and eps improvement compared to fiscal  reflecting the strength of our global business and the pipeline of profitable growth initiatives 
we expect increased capital expenditures in fiscal compared to fiscal  reflecting additional investments in store renovations  new store growth and manufacturing capacity 
operating segment overview starbucks has four reportable operating segments americas  europe  middle east  and africa emea  china and asia pacific cap and channel development 
seattle s best coffee is reported in other  along with evolution fresh  digital ventures and unallocated corporate expenses that pertain to corporate administrative functions that support our operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment and are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments 
the americas  emea and cap segments include company operated stores and licensed stores 
licensed stores generally have a higher operating margin than company operated stores 
under the licensed model  starbucks receives a reduced share of the total store revenues  but this is more than offset by the reduction in its share of costs as these are primarily incurred by the licensee 
the emea and cap segments have a higher relative share of licensed stores versus company operated stores compared to the americas segment  however  the americas segment has been operating significantly longer than the other segments and has developed deeper awareness of  and attachment to  the starbucks brand and stores among its customer base 
as a result  the more mature americas segment has significantly more stores and higher total revenues than the other segments 
average sales per store are also higher in the americas due to various factors including length of time in market and local income levels 

table of contents starbucks store base in emea and cap continues to expand and we continue to focus on achieving sustainable growth from established international markets while at the same time investing in emerging markets  such as china 
occupancy costs and store operating expenses can be higher in certain international markets than in the americas segment due to higher rents for prime store locations or costs of compliance with country specific regulatory requirements 
because many of our international operations are in an early phase of development  operating expenses as a percentage of related revenues are often higher compared to the americas segment 
international markets in the early stages of development require a more extensive support organization  relative to the current levels of revenue and operating income  than the americas 
the channel development segment includes packaged coffee and tea  a variety of ready to drink beverages  single serve coffee and tea products and other branded product operations worldwide  as well as the us foodservice business 
in prior years through the first several months of fiscal  we sold a selection of starbucks and seattle s best coffee branded packaged coffees and tazo teas in grocery and warehouse club stores throughout the us and to grocery stores in canada  the uk and other european countries through a distribution arrangement with kraft foods global  inc kraft managed the distribution  marketing  advertising and promotion of these products as a part of that arrangement 
during fiscal  we successfully transitioned these businesses including the marketing  advertising  and promotion of these products  from our previous distribution arrangement with kraft and began selling these products directly to the grocery and warehouse club stores 
our channel development segment also includes ready to drink beverages  which are primarily manufactured and distributed through the north american coffee partnership  a joint venture with the pepsi cola company 
the proportionate share of the results of the joint venture is included  on a net basis  in income from equity investees on the consolidated statements of earnings 
the us foodservice business sells coffee and other related products to institutional foodservice companies with the majority of its sales through national broad line distribution networks 
the channel development segment reflects a modest cost structure and a resulting higher operating margin  compared to the other reporting segments  which consist primarily of retail stores 
acquisitions see note to the consolidated financial statements in this k

we actively manage our cash and short term investments in order to internally fund operating needs domestically and internationally  make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings  and return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases 
our short term investments consisted predominantly of us treasury securities  commercial paper  corporate bonds  and us agency securities 
also included in our short term investment portfolio are certificates of deposit placed through an account registry service  with maturities ranging from days to one year 
the principal amounts of the individual certificates of deposit do not exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation limits 
our portfolio of long term available for sale securities consists predominantly of high investment grade corporate bonds  diversified among industries and individual issuers  as well as certificates of deposits with maturities greater than year 
borrowing capacity in november  we replaced our previous credit facility with a new million unsecured credit facility the credit facility with various banks  of which million may be used for issuances of letters of credit 
the credit facility is available for working capital  capital expenditures and other corporate purposes  including acquisitions and share repurchases and is currently set to mature in november starbucks has the option  subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks  to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional million 
the interest rate for any borrowings under the credit facility  based on starbucks current ratings and fixed charge coverage ratio  is over libor 
the specific spread over libor will depend upon our long term credit ratings assigned by moody s and standard poor s rating agencies and our fixed charge coverage ratio 
the credit facility contains provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants  including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  which measures our ability to cover financing expenses 
as of september  and october   we were in compliance with each of these covenants 
under our commercial paper program we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes  up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of million  with individual maturities that may vary  but not 
table of contents exceed days from the date of issue 
the program is backstopped by the credit facility and the combined borrowing limit is million for the commercial paper program and the credit facility 
starbucks may issue commercial paper from time to time  and the proceeds of the commercial paper financing may be used for working capital needs  capital expenditures and other corporate purposes  including acquisitions and share repurchases 
during fiscal and fiscal  there were no borrowings under the credit facility or commercial paper programs 
as of september  and october   a total of million and million  respectively  in letters of credit were outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
the million of year senior notes also require us to maintain compliance with certain covenants  including limits on future liens and sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties 
as of september  and october   we were in compliance with each of these covenants 
use of cash we expect to use our cash and short term investments  including any potential future borrowings under the credit facility and commercial paper program  to invest in our core businesses  including new product innovations and related marketing support  as well as other new business opportunities related to our core businesses 
we believe that future cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and short term investments both domestically and internationally will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses in those respective markets as well as shareholder distributions for the foreseeable future 
we consider the majority of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and equity investees as of september  to be indefinitely reinvested and  accordingly  no us income and foreign withholding taxes have been provided on such earnings 
we have not  nor do we anticipate the need to  repatriate funds to the us to satisfy domestic liquidity needs  however  in the event that we need to repatriate all or a portion of our foreign cash to the us we would be subject to additional us income taxes  which could be material 
we do not believe it is practical to calculate the potential tax impact of repatriation  as there is a significant amount of uncertainty around the calculation  including the availability and amount of foreign tax credits at the time of repatriation  tax rates in effect  and other indirect tax consequences associated with repatriation 
we may use our available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to our equity method and cost method investees 
we may also seek strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities and further build our business in support of our growth agenda 
acquisitions may include increasing our ownership interests in our equity method and cost method investees 
any decisions to increase such ownership interests will be driven by valuation and fit with our ownership strategy 
significant new joint ventures  acquisitions and or other new business opportunities may require additional outside funding 
as discussed further in note  we are in arbitration with kraft foods global  inc kraft for a commercial dispute relating to a distribution agreement we previously held with kraft 
as a part of those proceedings kraft has claimed damages inclusive of a premium and interest for terminating the arrangement 
we believe we have valid claims of material breach by kraft under the agreement 
we also believe kraft s claim is highly inflated and based upon faulty analysis 
however  should the arbitration result in an unfavorable outcome  we believe we have adequate liquidity 
other than normal operating expenses  cash requirements for fiscal are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for remodeling and refurbishment of  and equipment upgrades for  existing company operated stores  systems and technology investments in the stores and in the support infrastructure  new company operated stores  and additional investments in manufacturing capacity 
total capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to be approximately billion 
during the first three quarters of fiscal  we declared and paid a cash dividend to shareholders of per share 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal and the first three quarters of fiscal we declared and paid a cash dividend of per share

on november   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional million shares under our share repurchase program 
cash flows cash provided by operating activities was billion for fiscal year  compared to billion for fiscal year the slight increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net earnings in fiscal this was partially offset by a net increase in our working capital accounts  due primarily to increased payments on accounts payable 
cash used by investing activities totaled billion for fiscal years and net cash proceeds on investment maturities were offset by an increase in capital expenditures  primarily for remodeling and renovating existing company operated stores and opening new retail stores  the absence of cash proceeds from the sale of corporate real estate in the prior year and cash paid to acquire evolution fresh and bay bread  llc doing business as la boulange in the first and fourth quarters of fiscal  respectively 
cash used by financing activities for fiscal year totaled million  compared to million for fiscal year the increase was primarily due to an increase in cash returned to shareholders through higher dividend payments in fiscal the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and borrowings as of september   and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and capital requirements in future periods in millions payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase obligations debt obligations other obligations total income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions were excluded as we are not able to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments

commodity prices  availability and general risk conditions commodity price risk represents starbucks primary market risk  generated by our purchases of green coffee and dairy products  among other things 
we purchase  roast and sell high quality whole bean arabica coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee 
in addition to coffee  we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our company operated stores 
the price and availability of these commodities directly impacts our results of operations and can be expected to impact our future results of operations

financial risk management market risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices  foreign currency exchange rates  equity security prices  and interest rates 
we manage our exposure to various market based risks according to a market price risk management policy 
under this policy  market based risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies  such as entering into hedging transactions 
the market price risk management policy governs how hedging instruments may be used to mitigate risk 
risk limits are set annually and prohibit speculative trading activity 
we also monitor and limit the amount of associated counterparty credit risk 
in general  hedging instruments do not have maturities in excess of five years 
the sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited  point in time view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed 
the actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses 
commodity price risk we purchase commodity inputs  including coffee  dairy products and diesel that are used in our operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact our financial results 
in addition to fixed price and price to be fixed contracts for coffee purchases  we have entered into commodity hedges to manage commodity price risk using financial derivative instruments 
the following table summarizes the potential impact as of september  to starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income oci from changes in commodity prices

however  because a portion of our operations consists of activities outside of the us  we have transactions in other currencies  primarily the canadian dollar  british pound  euro  and japanese yen 
as a result  we may engage in 
table of contents transactions involving various derivative instruments to hedge revenues  inventory purchases  assets  and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
as of september   we had forward foreign exchange contracts that hedge portions of anticipated international revenue streams and inventory purchases 
in addition  we had forward foreign exchange contracts that qualify as accounting hedges of our net investment in starbucks japan to minimize foreign currency exposure 
starbucks also had forward foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes free standing derivatives  but which largely offset the financial impact of translating certain foreign currency denominated payables and receivables 
increases or decreases in the fair value of these derivatives are generally offset by corresponding decreases or increases in the us dollar value of our foreign currency denominated payables and receivables ie hedged items that would occur within the period 
the following table summarizes the potential impact as of september  to starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income oci from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due in turn to a change in the value of the us dollar as compared to the level of foreign exchange rates

the trading securities approximate a portion of our liability under the management deferred compensation plan mdcp 
a corresponding liability is included in accrued compensation and related costs on the consolidated balance sheets 
these investments are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in net interest income and other in the consolidated statements of earnings 
the offsetting changes in the mdcp liability are recorded in general and administrative expenses 
we performed a sensitivity analysis based on a change in the underlying equity prices of our investments as of september  and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments 
interest rate risk we utilize short term and long term financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage the effect of interest rate changes on our existing debt as well as the anticipated issuance of new debt 
as of september  and october   we did not have any interest rate hedge agreements outstanding 
the following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates as of september  on the fair value of starbucks debt in millions change in fair value fair value basis point increase in underlying rate basis point decrease in underlying rate debt our available for sale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of fixed income instruments 
the primary objectives of these investments are to preserve capital and liquidity 
available for sale securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component 
table of contents of accumulated other comprehensive income 
we do not hedge the interest rate exposure on our available for sale securities 
we performed a sensitivity analysis based on a basis point change in the underlying interest rate of our available for sale securities as of september   and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments 
application of critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we consider financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and or complexity asset impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long lived assets may not be recoverable  we evaluate long lived assets for impairment 
we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we measure an impairment loss based on the asset s estimated fair value 
for retail assets  the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level 
the fair value of a store s assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model based on internal projections 
key assumptions used in this calculation include revenue growth  operating expenses and a discount rate that we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the store 
estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections and consider a store s historical performance  local market economics and the business environment impacting the store s performance 
these estimates are subjective and can be significantly impacted by changes in the business or economic conditions 
for non retail assets  fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant facts and circumstances  which may include discounted cash flows  comparable transactions  or comparable company analyses 
our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values  including forecasting asset useful lives 
further  our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying values of our assets is affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets  changes in economic conditions  and changes in operating performance 
during the past three fiscal years  we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology that we use to assess long lived asset impairment loss 
for the foreseeable future  we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions that we use to calculate long lived asset impairment losses 
however  as we periodically reassess estimated future cash flows and asset fair values  changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future 
goodwill impairment we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during our third fiscal quarter  or more frequently if circumstances  such as material deterioration in performance or a significant number of store closures  indicate reporting unit carrying values may exceed their fair values 
when evaluating goodwill for impairment  we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not greater than the carrying amount 
if not  we calculate the implied estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied estimated fair value  an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the implied estimated fair value 
the fair value of each of our reporting units is the price a 
table of contents willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit and is typically calculated using a discounted cash flow model 
key assumptions used in this calculation include revenue growth  operating expenses and a discount rate that we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the reporting unit 
estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections considering a reporting unit s past performance and forecasted growth  local market economics and the local business environment impacting the reporting unit s performance 
the discount rate is calculated using an estimated cost of capital for a retail operator to operate the reporting unit in the region 
these estimates are highly subjective judgments and can be significantly impacted by changes in the business or economic conditions 
our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions in the qualitative assessment of the reporting unit and require management to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of our reporting units  including estimating future cash flows  and if necessary  the fair value of a reporting units assets and liabilities 
further  our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as changes in economic conditions  changes in our operating performance  and changes in our business strategies 
as a part of our ongoing operations  we may close certain stores within a reporting unit containing goodwill due to underperformance of the store or inability to renew our lease  among other reasons 
we abandon certain assets associated with a closed store including leasehold improvements and other non transferable assets 
under gaap  when a portion of a reporting unit that constitutes a business is to be disposed of  goodwill associated with the business is included in the carrying amount of the business in determining any loss on disposal 
our evaluation of whether the portion of a reporting unit being disposed of constitutes a business occurs on the date of abandonment 
although an operating store meets the accounting definition of a business prior to abandonment  it does not constitute a business on the closure date because the remaining assets on that date do not constitute an integrated set of assets that are capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors 
as a result  when closing individual stores  we do not include goodwill in the calculation of any loss on disposal of the related assets 
as noted above  if store closures are indicative of potential impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level  we perform an evaluation of our reporting unit goodwill when such closures occur 
during the past three fiscal years  we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology that we use to assess goodwill impairment loss 
for fiscal  we determined the fair value of our reporting units was substantially in excess of their carrying values 
accordingly  we did not recognize any goodwill impairments during the current fiscal year 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions that we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill in the foreseeable future 
however  as we periodically reassess our fair value calculations  including estimated future cash flows  changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future 
self insurance reserves we use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms  including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance treaty  to provide for the potential liabilities for certain risks  including workers compensation  healthcare benefits  general liability  property insurance  and director and officers liability insurance 
key assumptions used in the estimate of our self insurance reserves include the amount of claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date 
these liabilities  which are associated with the risks that are retained by starbucks are not discounted and are estimated  in part  by considering historical claims experience  demographic  exposure and severity factors  and other actuarial assumptions 
the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 
our self insurance reserves contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date 
periodically  we review our assumptions to determine the adequacy of our self insurance reserves 

table of contents during the past three fiscal years  we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology that we use to calculate our self insurance reserves 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions that we use to calculate our self insurance reserves for the foreseeable future 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a change in our self insurance reserves at september  would have affected net earnings by approximately million in fiscal income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse 
we routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if  based on all available evidence  we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized 
in addition  our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities 
these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions  including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
we evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions  we recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the relevant taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of our position 
for uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold  we record a related liability 
we adjust our unrecognized tax benefits liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled  the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position  or when new information becomes available 
income generated in certain foreign jurisdictions has not been subject to us income taxes 
we intend to reinvest these earnings for the foreseeable future 
if these amounts were distributed to the us  in the form of dividends or otherwise  we would be subject to additional us income taxes  which could be material 
determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liabilities on these earnings is not practicable because such liability  if any  is dependent on circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs 
deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liability for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation  the status of various income tax audits  and our particular facts and circumstances 
although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable  actual results could differ  and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established  or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability  our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected 
litigation accruals we are involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business 
legal and other contingency reserves and related disclosures are based on our assessment of the likelihood of a potential loss and our ability to estimate the loss or range of loss  which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and advisors 
we record reserves related to legal matters when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the range of such loss can be reasonably estimated 
such assessments are reviewed each period and revised  based on current facts and circumstances and historical experience with similar claims  as necessary 
our disclosures of and accruals for litigation claims  if any  contain uncertainties because management is required to use judgment to estimate the probability of a loss and a range of possible losses related to each claim 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the company s legal and other contingent liability matters 

table of contents as we periodically review our assessments of litigation accruals  we may change our assumptions with respect to loss probabilities and ranges of potential losses 
any changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our future results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements in this k for a detailed description of recent accounting pronouncements 
we do not expect these recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a material impact on our results of operations  financial condition  or liquidity in future periods
