this md a is intended to assist readers in their analysis of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and supplemental financial information 
it should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes in item of this form k 
when we refer to suntrust  the company  we  our and us in this narrative  we mean suntrust banks  inc and subsidiaries consolidated 
in the md a  net interest income and the net interest margin and efficiency ratios are presented on an fte and annualized basis 
the fte basis adjusts for the tax favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments 
we believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax exempt sources 
additionally  we present certain non us gaap metrics to assist investors in understanding management s view of particular financial measures  as well as  to align presentation of these financial measures with peers in the industry who may also provide a similar presentation 
reconcilements for all non us gaap measures are provided below in tables and executive overview economic and regulatory the economic recovery remained slow and uneven during  with many economic indicators having only improved modestly or remaining unchanged to levels seen at the end of unemployment remained high  the us housing market continued to show signs of weakness  and consumer confidence remained low 
unemployment remained above for a majority of the year  but improved to slightly below during the fourth quarter 
the us housing market continued to be weak as evidenced by the large inventory of foreclosed or distressed properties  home prices remaining under pressure  construction on new single family homes remaining at historically low levels  and uncertainty about future home prices causing sales of existing homes to remain weak 
consumer confidence was stagnant throughout the year and ended at a level comparable to the end of  as consumer spending increased at only a moderate pace due in part to inflationary pressures during the year that included elevated commodity prices 
additionally  the financial markets witnessed high levels of volatility during due to the economic uncertainty  the long term us debt downgrade by s p  and the european sovereign debt crisis 
as of december   we had no outstanding exposure to sovereign debt of european countries experiencing significant economic  fiscal  and or political strains 
see additional discussion of european debt exposure in other market risk in this md a 
amidst these challenging economic conditions  domestic and abroad  the federal reserve indicated in january that it expects to maintain key interest rates at exceptionally low levels  at least through late additionally  the federal reserve continues to conduct accommodative monetary policy through the maintenance of large portfolios of us treasury notes and bonds and agency mbs 
as of the end of  the federal reserve held approximately trillion of such securities 
the federal reserve is pursuing these policies to stimulate the economy in light of its january outlook for moderate real gdp growth  a high unemployment rate  and modest consumer price inflation in regulatory and financial reform continued in  as regulatory agencies proposed and finalized numerous rules during the year  some of which became effective in and others that will begin to impact us in and beyond 
in  the fdic finalized its rules related to the calculation of banks deposit insurance assessment that were effective beginning in the second quarter of the rules required banks to base the deposit insurance calculation on our total average assets less average tangible equity  rather than based only on domestic deposits 
in addition  the fdic revised the overall pricing structure for large banks  which resulted in assessment rates being affected by specific risk characteristics  such as asset concentrations  liquidity  and asset quality 
the impact of these rules has caused our regulatory expenses to increase during the year by 
during the year  we expanded our deposit product offerings  in response to revisions to regulation q  that became effective in the third quarter  to include payment of interest on business ddas 
as expected  the interest paid on these products was nominal  and we expect that to continue while the low rate environment exists 
conversely  during the fourth quarter of  the federal reserve s final rules related to debit card interchange fees became effective 
the debit card interchange rules limit the amount of interchange fee income that can be received for electronic debit transactions 
when comparing the fourth quarter interchange revenue to the third quarter  we experienced a decrease of million  and as such  continue to believe going forward  the estimated impact of this rule may decrease our interchange revenue by about  or approximately million per quarter 
we continue to expect to mitigate about of the approximately million combined annual revenue reductions from regulation e implemented in and rules related to debit card interchange fees 
these mitigating actions are expected to begin impacting revenue over the course of and into  and inherent in this expectation is our ability to charge certain deposit related fees for value added services we provide 
see additional discussion in the noninterest income section of this md a 
during the fourth quarter  a joint agency proposal was presented for implementation of the volcker rule of the dodd frank act related to increased regulation of derivatives and proprietary trading 
while the rule remains in the formulative stage  based on the current proposal  we do not expect a material impact to our operations when it becomes effective in the third quarter of in  the federal reserve conducted a horizontal review of the nation s largest mortgage loan servicers  including us 
following this review  we and other servicers entered into a consent order with the federal reserve 
we describe the consent order in note  contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements in this form k 
see also  part i  item a  risk factors  in this form k and nonperforming assets in this md a 
the consent order requires us to improve certain mortgage servicing and foreclosure processes and to retain an independent consultant to conduct a review of residential foreclosure actions pending during and to identify any errors  misrepresentations or deficiencies  determine whether any instances so identified resulted in financial injury  and then make any appropriate remediation  reimbursement  or adjustment 
our work required to comply with the federal reserve s consent order is continuing 
we currently anticipate modest increases in certain expenses  namely personnel and consulting  as we implement and comply with the provisions of the consent order 
we are actively evaluating other proposed rules and regulations  and as they emerge from the various stages of implementation and promulgation  we expect to be in a position to comply with new requirements and take appropriate actions as warranted 
capital during  the federal reserve completed its ccar for the nineteen largest us bank holding companies 
upon completion of their review  the federal reserve did not object to the capital plan that we submitted 
as a result  we initiated and completed certain elements of our capital plan  including issuing billion of common stock and billion of senior debt 
in addition  we used the proceeds from those offerings  as well as other available funds  to repurchase billion of fixed rate cumulative preferred stock  series c and billion of fixed rate cumulative preferred stock  series d that was issued to the us treasury under the cpp in november and december  the repurchase of the preferred stock eliminated approximately million in annual preferred dividend payments and discount accretion that has been negatively affecting our earnings the past two years 
additionally  by keeping our shareholders best interest in mind and demonstrating a patient and deliberate approach to the repayment of the us government s tarp investment  we believe that we successfully lessened the impact to our shareholders by issuing less common stock than what would have been required had we chosen to repay earlier 
the federal reserve now requires annual ccar submissions and is currently reviewing our recent submission made on january  our capital remained strong at december   and the level of common equity was significantly bolstered as a result of the successful common equity raise in the first quarter of  as well as retained earnings growth 
our tier common equity ratio increased to compared to at december  meanwhile  as a result of the change in our equity mix due to the repurchase of the preferred stock issued to the us treasury and repurchase of approximately million of trust preferred securities during the year  as well as the impact of loan growth on rwa  our tier capital ratio declined to  compared to at december  at december   our tier capital ratio  excluding preferred stock issued to the us treasury  was 
our total capital ratio at december  was compared to at december  overall  our capital remains strong and well above the requirements to be considered well capitalized according to current and proposed regulatory standards 
consistent with our desire to take actions that will positively benefit our shareholders  we made decisions during the year that increased the return of capital to our shareholders 
first  our board approved an increase in the quarterly common stock dividend to per share for the third and fourth quarters 
second  when the us treasury auctioned our common stock warrants in october  we repurchased and retired approximately million of the million common stock warrants auctioned 
looking ahead  upon completion of the federal reserve s ccar process in early  we will evaluate additional actions to further increase the return of capital to shareholders in see additional discussion of our liquidity and capital position in the liquidity risk and capital resources sections of this md a 
financial performance while presented a challenging operating environment  we ended the year with significantly better momentum than when it started and achieved several milestones in our transformation to operate more efficiently and effectively in the new environment 
during  eps increased meaningfully  we paid back the us government s tarp investment  low cost deposits were at record highs  we continued to change the risk composition of our loan portfolio in favor of lower risk loans while growing total loans  credit quality steadily improved during the year  capital ratios remained strong  and we launched an all encompassing review of our operating expenses with a goal of eliminating million in annual expenses by the end of these efforts  coupled with our continued focus on serving our clients and managing our core business to drive improved bottom line results  as well as improved credit quality  resulted in significant improvement of earnings during net income available to common shareholders during the year of million  or per average common diluted share  compares favorably to a net loss available to common shareholders of million  or per average common diluted share during and a net loss available to common shareholders of billion  or per average common diluted share during results in were driven by lower provision for credit losses  higher net interest income  and the reduction of preferred dividends paid to the us treasury after repayment of the us government s tarp investment in march 
results during and were driven by higher provision for credit losses  higher interest expense  and the payment of preferred dividends to the us treasury 
during the years ended december  and  improved credit quality resulted in the decrease of and in our provision for credit losses compared to the years ended december  and  respectively  which was a significant driver of the increase in our net income loss available to common shareholders 
as credit quality continues to improve  the impact to net income available to common shareholders due to lower provisions for credit losses is expected to be less substantial in future periods 
our results have improved and progress is being made for further improvement  but our performance is not where we would like for it to be  and therefore we announced specific initiatives during that are aimed at improving our performance in the future 
our ppg is the collection of initiatives across the organization that we believe will improve efficiency and  over time will be a key component in our plan to reduce our efficiency ratio to targeted levels below  as will the expected normalization in credit related expense and mortgage repurchase provision as the economic environment improves 
the three main components of the ppg expense program are focused in the areas of strategic supply management  consumer bank efficiencies  and operations staff and support 
we have made significant progress in our planning for ppg  and implementation is underway on many of its initiatives that should result in million in annual expense savings  with the majority of the actions to be accomplished during and the remainder in at the end of  million in annualized savings had been realized with a majority coming from the strategic supply management area as a result of actions taken related to vendor costs  demand management  and discretionary spending 
initiatives in the consumer bank area and operations support and staff also contributed to the savings realized in  primarily due to refining the branch network and staffing models and through consolidations and shared services related to certain operational staff and support teams 
by the end of  we anticipate realization of at least million in annualized savings through our ppg expense program  with the remainder realized by december our asset quality metrics improved again this year  with improvements in the provision for credit losses  net charge offs  npls  nonperforming assets  and early stage delinquencies 
at december   the alll ratio remains elevated by historical standards at of total loans and declined basis points and basis points compared to december  and  respectively  in part due to decreases in the alll during and  coupled with an increase in loans 
the improvement in credit quality drove a and decrease in the provision for loan losses compared to and  respectively 
additionally  net charge offs declined and compared to and  respectively 
we currently expect net charge offs to be stable to modestly down during the first quarter of total npls continued the downward trend that began in  with a decline of from december  as a result of reduced inflows into nonaccrual combined with our problem loan resolution efforts 
npls are also down compared to december  we expect a continuation of the trend in npls with additional declines in the first quarter of oreo declined during the year and compared to december  the declines since year end and were the result of disposition of properties once we had clear title  coupled with a slow down of inflows 
our restructured loan portfolio is relatively unchanged in total compared to december   with a decrease in the nonaccruing loans offset by an increase in the accruing loan population 
however  the restructured loan population has grown by since december  as a result of our efforts for clients who were experiencing financial difficulty to restructure their loan to avoid foreclosure 
as a result  our accruing restructured loan portfolio  which is primarily mortgage and consumer loans  increased by and compared to december  and  respectively 
however  the portfolio continued to exhibit strong payment performance with current on principal and interest payments at december  early stage delinquencies  a leading indicator of asset quality  particularly for consumer loans  remained stable this year  however  when excluding government guaranteed loan delinquencies  early stage delinquencies declined basis points from december  this decline was a result of our efforts to reduce risk in the portfolio during the year as evidenced by a decline in higher risk loans coupled with the growth of government guaranteed loans 
see additional discussion of credit and asset quality in the loans  allowance for credit losses  nonperforming assets  and restructured loans  sections of this md a 
average loans increased by billion  or  during the year  with increases in commercial industrial and consumer loans being partially offset by decreases in residential and commercial real estate loans 
the total average loan balances have only increased modestly from  but our risk profile has improved noticeably as we made progress on diversifying the portfolio and reducing risk 
our efforts in resulted in a decline in certain higher risk loan portfolios  which have been offset by targeted growth in certain lower risk portfolios  such as government guaranteed loans 
as a result  our guaranteed loans represent of the portfolio as of december  compared to at december  a major driver of the increase in government guaranteed loans has been the purchase of guaranteed loan portfolios 
while our decision to purchase government guaranteed loans has benefited us in the current economic cycle  as the economy grows and organic loan growth increases  we expect slower growth of our government guaranteed portfolios in the future 
additionally  despite continued soft overall loan demand  we remain committed to providing home financing in the communities we serve and are focused on extending credit to qualified borrowers during this uncertain economic landscape 
to that end  during the year ended december   we extended approximately billion in new loan originations  commitments  and renewals of commercial  residential  and consumer loans to our clients 
client deposit growth continued its positive trajectory  reaching record highs during  and the positive shift in deposit mix continued with lower cost deposit increases more than offsetting the decline in higher cost deposits 
average consumer and commercial deposits increased during  led by average balance increases of in lower cost noninterest bearing ddas  predominantly offset by declines in higher cost cds of 
due to the growth seen in core deposits  our liquidity has been enhanced  enabling us to reduce our higher cost funding sources  helping to drive significant reductions in our funding costs 
while we continue to believe that a portion of the low cost deposit growth is attributable to clients desires for having increased liquidity  we believe that we have also proactively generated this growth in both our consumer and wholesale business  as we have expanded the number of primary client relationships and improved our client loyalty 
our client focused revenue generation strategies  lower cost funding mix  and improved asset quality contributed to improved operating trends as seen in higher net interest income and lower provision for credit losses  partially offset by higher noninterest expenses compared to a year ago 
total revenue  on an fte basis  declined compared to  but increased from the change compared to was primarily due to an increase in net interest income offset by a decline in noninterest income as a result of lower mortgage related income  lower service charge income  and lower securities gains 
the increase compared to was due primarily to an increase in net interest income  partially offset by a decline in noninterest income as a result of less service charges and mortgage related income 
net interest income  on an fte basis  increased during and compared to the increase in net interest income was due to lower funding costs and an improved funding mix 
as a result  our net interest margin increased to for the year ended december  from during the same period in  and during noninterest income declined compared to  most notably due to decreases in mortgage related income  service charge income  and lower securities gains  partially offset by higher trading income driven by higher valuation gains on our fair value debt and index linked cds 
compared to  noninterest income declined  with increases in trading income  card fees  investment banking income  and trust income  offset by declines in mortgage related income  service charge income  and the gain on sale of visa share ownership 
the driver for the decline in mortgage related income compared to both earlier years was primarily due to less favorable net hedge performance and lower loan production volume that resulted in lower gain on sale and fee income 
service charge income declined compared to both earlier years as a result of regulation e changes in noninterest expense increased during  driven primarily by higher personnel costs  operating losses  regulatory costs  and potential mortgage servicing settlement and claims expense  partially offset by lower gains on debt extinguishment 
compared to  noninterest expense decreased by primarily due to the recognition of goodwill impairment in  partially offset by higher personnel costs  operating losses  and the potential mortgage servicing settlement and claims expense in the higher personnel costs are due to the hiring of additional teammates  primarily in loss mitigation and in client service and support roles  and an increase in compensation as a result of improved revenue generation in certain businesses 
the increase in the operating losses was due to increases in legal and mortgage servicing related expenses  while the regulatory cost increases were due to the change in the fdic assessment calculation 
the mortgage servicing settlement and claims expense includes an accrual of our estimated costs to address certain mortgage servicing claims 
see additional discussion of our financial performance in the consolidated financial results section of this md a  and note  contingencies and note  subsequent event  to the consolidated financial statements in this form k related to the potential mortgage servicing settlement and claims expense 
line of business highlights many of our core businesses demonstrated positive trends during  helping to offset some of the regulatory and environmental challenges we encountered 
our strategic priorities to drive higher profitability from a more diverse platform encompass growing consumer market and wallet share  diversifying the loan portfolio  optimizing our business mix  and improving expense efficiency 
the key to accomplishing these priorities is driven by our core performance within each line of business 
despite the challenging regulatory environment  our retail line of business accomplished growth in consumer market and wallet share in while navigating numerous product changes  we were able to expand our primary relationships and also expanded our product penetration per relationship 
we grew our deposit market share in eight of our ten largest markets  we grew average loan balances by  and increased net income during net income in our w im line of business increased during the net income improvement was driven by growth in revenue  led by retail investment income growth of  while maintaining stable expenses 
improving markets in could augment growth for this line of business 
growing the cib and diversified commercial banking lines of business are key elements to our strategy of optimizing our business mix 
in  the cib line of business experienced average loan growth and record revenue and net income  increasing by and  respectively 
our success in cib is a result of growing revenue  expanding relationships  and investing in talent 
solid growth in net interest income and fee income resulted in total revenue fte and net income increasing and  respectively  in the diversified commercial banking line of business during diversified commercial banking had a solid efficiency ratio  steady loan growth in the second half of  and strong growth in core deposits and primary relationships driving the line of business success in both of these businesses had attractive efficiency ratios and experienced low loss rates during  and we will look to build upon the positive expense efficiency and credit quality attributes in while we are experiencing solid core business momentum in retail  w im  cib  and diversified commercial banking  legacy mortgage and cre issues are weighing on our overall financial performance 
the mortgage line of business lost million in  largely due to issues related to loans originated in and prior 
while we work through these legacy loan issues  during we experienced healthy mortgage origination volumes  attractive margins  and significantly improved risk management 
our cre line of business lost million during as it had housing related exposure as well  causing high levels of loss recognition during the year 
cre is our smallest line of business  but one with a potential for earning asset growth 
in fact  we are transitioning the business back into production as we are beginning to see opportunities in certain markets and asset classes 
our corporate treasury and other line of business encompasses all remaining areas of the company and is key to our asset and liability performance 
this line of business has maintained an intense focus on balance sheet management and positioned us for prolonged low interest rates due to a high level of discipline around our asset and liability pricing 
this discipline has benefited our margin in  which helped drive the million in net income in this line of business

net interest income margin net interest income  on an fte basis  was billion during  an increase of million  up  from this increase was predominantly driven by a continued positive trend in net interest margin  which increased by basis points to in from in earning asset yields declined by basis points to  compared with during  while the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased by basis points over the same period 
net interest margin increased  predominantly due to the growth in lower cost deposits  specifically dda and money market accounts  along with a decrease in higher cost time deposits and long term debt 
we expect the net interest margin to decline modestly in the first quarter of  as earning asset yield compression is expected as a result of the continued low rate environment 
average earning assets increased by billion  or less than  compared with the increase was predominantly due to an increase in average loans  which was up by billion  or 
the increase in loans was primarily attributable to increases of billion  or  in commercial loans  primarily driven by our large corporate borrowers  billion  or  in consumer indirect loans  driven by purchases of high quality auto loan portfolios  and billion  or  of consumer direct loans related to an increase in government guaranteed student loans 
these increases were partially offset by declines of billion  or  in commercial real estate and by billion  or  in real estate construction  both predominantly as a result of our targeted efforts to reduce exposure to these higher risk loans  and by a billion  or  decline in nonaccrual loans  primarily commercial nonaccrual loans  and a billion  or  decrease in real estate home equity lines 
securities afs also decreased by billion  down  predominantly due to the sale of lower yielding us treasury securities of billion  partially offset by purchases of agency mbs and federal agency securities 
see additional discussion in the securities available for sale section in this md a for more information on the repositioning of our securities afs portfolio 
lhfs declined by billion  or  as a result of a reduction in closed mortgage loan volume 
our loan portfolio yielded for the year  down basis points from the yield decline was predominantly related to higher balances in the consumer indirect loan portfolio that included high quality loans acquired at lower rates and the real estate family loan portfolio  which was driven by run off of higher rate loans that we replaced with lower rate government guaranteed loans 
we utilize interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk 
the largest notional position of these swaps are receive fixed pay floating interest rate swaps that convert a portion of our commercial loan portfolio from floating rates  based on libor  to fixed rates 
as of december   the outstanding notional balance of swaps was billion  which qualified as cash flow hedges on variable rate commercial loans  compared with billion as of december  swap income remained relatively stable at million during compared with million during reflected in our swap income during  was approximately million of income related to terminated swaps 
beginning in the second quarter of  the income from certain swaps that were previously terminated will decline by approximately million per quarter 
in the absence of additions or terminations  our notional balance of swaps will begin to mature in the second quarter of with remaining maturities through early the average maturity of our swap notional balances at december  was years 
the us government recently announced a plan that could potentially impact prepayments and borrower payment caps related to a portion of our student loan portfolio 
some of our portfolio was acquired at a discount and prepayments may result in additional net interest income  however  the impact of the plan is not expected to have a material effect on our net interest income 
average interest bearing liabilities declined by billion  or  from  predominantly as a result of a billion  or  decline in higher cost time deposits and a billion  or  decline in long term debt 
the declines in time deposits and long term debt were partially offset by an increase in lower cost client deposits  as compared to the same period during total average consumer and commercial deposits increased by billion  or  compared with the same period during this increase was predominantly driven by a billion  or  increase in demand deposits 
the growth in lower cost deposits and the decline in time deposits and wholesale funding resulted in a basis point decline in rates paid on interest bearing liabilities compared with the same period during the growth in lower cost deposits was the result of marketing campaigns  competitive pricing and clients increased preference for more liquid products 
during  the interest rate environment was characterized by a flattening of the yield curve versus  as rates at the long end of the curve declined 
more specifically  the fed funds target rate averaged  unchanged from last year 
the prime rate averaged  unchanged from during  benchmark rates were as follows compared with  one month libor averaged  a decrease of basis points  three month libor averaged  unchanged from  five year swaps averaged  a decrease of basis points  and ten year swaps averaged  a decrease of basis points

mortgage servicing related income decreased by million  or  compared with the year ended december  the decline was due to less favorable net hedge performance and lower msr valuations resulting from an increase in prepayment assumptions attributable to increased refinancing activity 
furthermore  during the fourth quarter of  mortgage servicing related income was impacted by a decline in fair value of msrs of million due to the harp program  which is anticipated to result in higher refinance activity 
see the other market risk section of this md a for further information regarding the risks pertaining to the valuation of our msrs 
the remaining decrease is due to a decline in service fees attributable to a decrease in the servicing portfolio 
as of december   the balance of mortgages serviced was billion compared with billion as of december  mortgage production related loss income was a loss of million for the year ended december  compared with income of million for the year ended december  the decline was predominantly due to declines in loan production volume 
loan production volume of billion in was down billion  or  from the prior year  coupled with lower margins  which resulted in lower gain on sale and fee income 
additionally  the mortgage repurchase provision for the year ended december  was million compared with million for the year ended december   an increase of million due to the increase in agency related repurchase requests see below for additional discussion 
the reserves for mortgage repurchases was million as of december   an increase of million from prior year 
repurchase requests can vary significantly from period to period based on the timing of requests from the gses 
mortgage repurchase demands were elevated during compared to the majority of our demands are from loans in the vintages that have been days past due at some point in their life cycle 
in addition  the majority of the demands that we have received have been from loans that were delinquent within the first months after origination 
if this pattern continues and investor selection criteria does not change  it suggests that the pool of delinquent loans from which we will receive demands could be stabilizing  given that any performing loans from the vintages have now been outstanding beyond months 
this pattern is expected to result in a decline in the mortgage repurchase provision in the second half of however  we believe that demands will continue to be volatile and may remain elevated in a continued sluggish economy and any further declines in housing values could impact the future amount of demands 
if demands do not decline from levels seen in the latter half of  we may see an increase in the repurchase provision in  which would result in lower mortgage production income 
as a result of the continued uncertainty and our expectation of elevated demands in the near term  our mortgage repurchase reserve remains at historically high levels

service charges on deposit accounts decreased by million  or  compared with the year ended december  the decrease was attributable to regulation e changes and a voluntary decision to eliminate fees on transactions where the overdrafted amount is small  as well as reducing the maximum number of daily overdraft fees charged to our clients 
the voluntary changes and the regulation e impact began during the third quarter of net securities gains decreased by million  or  compared with the year ended december  during and  we repositioned the securities afs portfolio in response to market conditions  which caused sales and the resulting gains 
see securities available for sale in this md a for further discussion regarding our repositioning activity 
trading income loss increased by million  or  compared with the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to valuation gains on our fair value debt  net of hedges  and index linked cds of million for the year ended december  compared with valuation losses of million for the year december  driven by the widening of financial institutions credit spreads amidst market volatility during the year 
additionally  we experienced lower valuation losses associated with the deterioration of collateral on previously securitized loans 
these were partially offset by lower valuation gains on illiquid securities and a decline in core trading revenue due to market volatility during the second half of the year caused by the us debt downgrade by s p and the low interest rate environment 
trust and investment management income increased by million  or  compared with the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to higher revenue from our ridgeworth mutual fund complex and higher market valuations on managed equity assets 
retail investment services income increased by million  or  compared with the year ended december  the increases were driven by higher recurring brokerage revenue and annuity income 
other charges and fees decreased by million  or  compared with the year ended december  premium income related to reinsurance services declined due to paydowns in underlying loans principal balances and the termination of contracts during the year 
fee income was also impacted by a decline in letter of credit fees due to a reduction of billion in outstanding letters of credit 
card fees decreased by million  or  compared with the year ended december  the decline was a result of regulations on debit card interchange fee income that became effective at the beginning of fourth quarter on june   the federal reserve issued a final rule establishing revised standards that significantly lowered the rates that can be charged on debit card transactions and prohibited network exclusivity arrangements and routing restrictions 
we estimated that this rule  effective at the beginning of the fourth quarter  would reduce our debit interchange income by about  or approximately million per quarter prior to any mitigating actions 
as a means to mitigate some of this lost revenue  we have introduced new checking account products which are aligned with clients needs and which we expect will provide additional streams of fee income 
additionally  we also expect to benefit from the discontinuation of our debit card rewards programs  actions taken to reduce the costs related to our debit card program  and the introduction of other value added deposit product features over the next two years  which we expect will produce additional deposit fee income 
collectively  and over time  we currently estimate that the benefits from all of these changes will enable us to recapture of the approximate million of combined annual revenue loss attributable to both the newly issued interchange fee rules and regulation e 
inherent in this expectation is our ability to charge certain deposit related fees for value added services we provide 
investment banking income increased by million  or  compared with the year ended december  the increase over was primarily attributable to strong syndicated finance fees  which resulted from continued market penetration 
we note that investment banking income has and will continue to experience volatility due to market factors and client behavior patterns 
other noninterest income increased by million  or  compared with the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to current year gains on private equity investments and client leasing transactions 
noninterest expense table year ended december dollars in millions employee compensation employee benefits personnel expenses outside processing and software net occupancy expense regulatory assessments credit and collection services other real estate expense operating losses marketing and customer development equipment expense consulting and legal potential mortgage servicing settlement and claims expense other staff expense postage and delivery communications operating supplies amortization of intangible assets impairment of goodwill net gain loss on debt extinguishment other expense total noninterest expense noninterest expense increased by million  or  compared with the year ended december  the increase in expense was driven predominantly by higher operating losses  potential mortgage servicing settlement and claims expense  personnel and other staff  consulting and legal  and regulatory assessments 
these higher costs were partially offset by a net gain on the extinguishment of debt compared to a net loss on extinguishment in  as well as a decline in other real estate expense 
operating losses increased by million  compared with the year ended december  the increase was due to compliance related costs largely attributable to mortgage servicing and litigation expenses tied to specific claims 
the potential mortgage servicing settlement and claims expense was due to the accrual of our estimated costs to address certain mortgage servicing claims 
see additional discussion in note  contingencies and note  subsequent event  to the consolidated financial statements in this form k 
personnel expenses increased by million  or  compared with the year ended december  the million  or  increase in employee compensation expense related to higher compensation from improved business performance and increases in client facing full time equivalent employees 
the increase was largely offset by a million  or decrease in employee benefits  predominantly due to a million gain related to curtailment of our pension plan net of a discretionary k contribution 
during the year we made the decision to curtail the pension plan and concurrent with the curtailment  we made a contribution to our longer tenured teammates k accounts 
other staff expense increased by million  or  compared with the year ended december   predominantly due to an increase in severance related expenses 
the severance related expenses were associated with our ppg expense program 
the severance related expenses reflect the progress that we made during the year on the design and implementation of the ppg expense program  and we believe the expenses recorded in to be a majority of the severance expense that will be incurred over the life of the program 
consulting and legal expenses increased by million  or  compared with the year ended december  the increase was attributable to consulting costs associated with specific business initiatives  as well as costs to address the consent order with the federal reserve 
for additional information regarding the consent order  see note  contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements in this form k and the nonperforming assets section of this md a 
regulatory assessments expense increased by million  or  compared with the year ended december  the increase was the result of the change in the assessment base for fdic insurance premiums that took effect at the beginning of the second quarter of net losses on debt extinguishment decreased by million  compared with the year ended december  net losses on debt extinguishment in the prior year were primarily due to early termination fees on the extinguishment of billion in fhlb borrowings  as well as the fees paid to repurchase million of our debt in a tender offer 
other real estate expense decreased by million  or  compared with the year ended december  the decrease was predominantly due to less loss provisioning as sales of owned properties increased while inflows of new properties decreased 
over time  as the economic environment improves  we expect that other real estate expense will continue to improve  but will likely remain elevated compared with the levels realized prior to the economic recession 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes includes both federal and state income taxes 
for the year ended december   the provision for income taxes was million  resulting in an effective tax rate of 
the effective tax rate was primarily a result of positive pre tax earnings adjusted for net favorable permanent tax items  such as interest income from lending to tax exempt entities and federal tax credits from community reinvestment activities 
for the year ended december   we had an income tax benefit of million which was primarily driven by the net favorable permanent tax items significantly exceeding positive pre tax earnings 
see additional discussion related to the provision for income taxes in note  income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements in this form k 
loans in  we adopted accounting guidance that requires additional disclosures about the credit quality of our loan portfolios and the credit reserves held against them 
these disclosures are intended to describe the nature of credit risk inherent in our loan portfolio  provide information on how we analyze and assess that risk in arriving at an adequate and appropriate alll  and explain the changes in the alll and reasons for those changes 
additionally  the disclosures are required to be made on a disaggregated basis by loan portfolio segment and or by type of loan 
a portfolio segment is defined as the level at which we develop and document our method for determining our alll 
loan types are further categorizations of our portfolio segments 
in conjunction with adopting the accounting guidance  we adjusted loan classifications to align with post adoption loan classifications 
while the reclassification had no effect on the carrying value of our lhfi or lhfs  sec regulations require us  in some instances  to present five years of comparable data where trend information may be deemed relevant  in which case we have provided the pre adoption loan classifications due to the inability to restate all prior periods under the post adoption loan classifications 
under the post adoption classification  we report our loan portfolio in three segments commercial  residential  and consumer 
loans are assigned to these segments based upon the type of borrower  collateral  and or our underlying credit management processes 
additionally  within each segment  we have identified loan types  or classes  which further identify loans based upon common risk characteristics 
the commercial and industrial loan type includes loans secured by owner occupied properties  corporate credit cards and other wholesale lending activities 
commercial real estate and commercial construction loan types are based on investor exposures where repayment is largely dependent upon the operation  refinance  or sale of the underlying real estate 
commercial and construction loans secured by owner occupied properties are classified as commercial and industrial loans  as the primary source of loan repayment for owner occupied properties is business income and not real estate operations 
residential mortgages consist of loans secured by family homes  mostly prime first lien loans  both guaranteed and nonguaranteed 
residential construction loans include residential lot loans and construction to perm loans 
home equity products consist of equity lines of credit and closed end equity loans that may be in either a first lien or junior lien position 
at december   of our home equity products were in a first lien position and were in a junior lien position 
for home equity products in a junior lien position  we service of the loans that are senior to the home equity product 
only a small percentage of home equity lines are scheduled to convert to amortizing in and  with of home equity line balances scheduled to convert to amortization in or later 
it should be noted that a majority of accounts do not convert to amortizing 
based on historical trends  within months of the end of their draw period  more than of accounts  and approximately of accounts with a balance  closed or refinanced before  or soon after converting 
we perform credit management activities on home equity accounts to limit our loss exposure 
these activities result in the suspension of available credit of most home equity junior lien accounts when the first lien position is delinquent  including when the junior lien is still current 
we do not actively monitor the first lien delinquency status on an on going basis when we do not own or service the first lien position beyond the initial notification of the first lien becoming delinquent 
however  we actively monitor refreshed credit bureau scores  which are highly sensitive to first lien mortgage delinquency  of borrowers with junior liens 
at december   our home equity junior lien loss severity was approximately 
the loan types comprising our consumer loan segment include guaranteed student loans  other direct  consisting primarily of private student loans  indirect  consisting of loans secured by automobiles or recreational vehicles  and credit cards 
the composition of the company s loan portfolio at december is shown in the following tables loan portfolio by types of loans post adoption table dollars in millions commercial loans commercial industrial commercial real estate commercial construction total commercial loans residential loans residential mortgages guaranteed residential mortgages nonguaranteed home equity products residential construction total residential loans consumer loans guaranteed student loans other direct indirect credit cards total consumer loans lhfi lhfs includes million  million  and million of loans carried at fair value at december    and  respectively 
loans held for investment our loan growth performance was strong  with lhfi increasing billion  up during the year ended december  growth was driven by increases in the commercial and industrial and government guaranteed student and guaranteed residential mortgage loans 
we continued to make progress in our loan portfolio diversification strategy  as we have been successful both in growing targeted commercial and consumer areas  and in reducing our exposure to certain residential and construction areas that we consider to be higher risk 
continuing to manage down our commercial and residential construction portfolios has resulted in a combined billion decline in these portfolios during the year ended december   and a billion decrease since the end of at the same time that we have been managing these and other higher risk balances down  we have also been reducing our risk by increasing our government guaranteed loans 
these efforts have driven a meaningful improvement in our risk profile 
our strategy to purchase government guaranteed loans has performed well as a bridge during a time of low economic growth and  if organic loan growth continues in the coming quarters  we expect slower growth in this category 
government guaranteed loans increased this year by about billion  and they now total billion  or of our loan portfolio 
commercial loans increased billion  up during the year ended december  growth was driven by a billion increase in commercial and industrial loans  largely offset by decreases in commercial construction loans and commercial real estate loans 
our larger corporate borrowers drove much of the increase in commercial and industrial loans 
growth came across most industry verticals  with healthcare and energy contributing the most 
meanwhile  commercial construction loans decreased by billion  down  primarily as a result of our efforts to reduce risk levels by aggressively managing existing construction exposure 
residential loans remained relatively flat during the year ended december  government guaranteed mortgages grew billion  up  as we added to this portfolio during the fourth quarter of  and thereby continued to make progress on diversifying and de risking the overall balance sheet 
we experienced declines across all other residential loan classes  especially home equity and residential construction 
the overall decline was predominantly driven by payoffs  with current year net charge offs and transfers to oreo also contributing to the decline 
consumer loans increased billion  up during the year ended december  growth occurred across all consumer loan classes  with government guaranteed student loans being the largest driver  increasing by billion  up  due to portfolio acquisitions 
loans held for sale lhfs decreased billion  down during the year ended december  the decline was attributable to a reduction in closed mortgage loan volume  coupled with increased delivery volume to our lhfi portfolio

asset quality our overall asset quality improved steadily throughout  with net charge offs  npls  and nonperforming assets all declining  as compared with the prior year 
the total delinquency ratio remained flat during compared with december   but increased basis points during the fourth quarter of the increase was due to the purchase of government guaranteed student loan portfolios  which have higher delinquency rates  although the true loss exposure is very low due to the government guarantee 
early stage delinquencies excluding government guaranteed loans continued to trend lower  down basis points during the year  driven by improvements in nonguaranteed mortgages and home equity loans 
commercial and consumer early stage delinquencies reached relatively low levels of and of total loans at december   respectively  while residential early stage delinquencies declined to 
any further improvement in overall delinquencies will be influenced by the overall economy  particularly by changes in unemployment and to a lesser extent  home values 
npls totaled billion as of december   and compared to december   npls decreased billion  down 
approximately billion of the overall decline came from commercial construction npls as a result of continuing risk mitigation activities 
we continue to be proactive in our credit monitoring and management processes to provide early warning of problem loans 
for example  we use an expanded liquidity and contingency analysis to provide a thorough view of borrowers capacity and their ability to service their debt obligations 
we also have strict limits and exposure caps on specific projects and borrowers for risk diversification 
due to the lack of new construction projects and the completion of many that were previously started  the aggregate amount of interest reserves that we are obligated to fund has declined from prior periods and are not considered significant relative to total loans outstanding 
overall asset quality trends for residential loans showed improvement throughout for the year  net charge offs decreased by over million  or about  with residential loans being the largest driver  contributing million towards the decline 
residential npls also declined modestly  down  driven by improvements in residential construction and nonguaranteed mortgages 
as we look to the first quarter of  we expect to see a further decline in npls  with net charge offs relatively stable to modestly down 
net charge offs and early stage delinquencies for the home equity portfolio declined  while npls remained relatively stable  showing slight decreases during the year 
runoff in this portfolio has been concentrated in the higher ltv loans  where a very limited amount of production has occurred during while these higher ltv loans have additional availability on their home equity lines at december   of already outstanding borrowings on the lines are accruing and current on interest and principal 
commercial net charge offs declined million during  down compared to the prior year  led by decreases in our commercial construction and commercial and industrial portfolios 
given the stresses in the commercial real estate market  we have performed a thorough analysis of our commercial real estate portfolio to identify loans with an increased risk of default 
we believe that our investor owned portfolio is appropriately diversified by borrower  geography  and property type 
we typically underwrite commercial projects to credit standards that are more stringent than historical commercial mbs guidelines 
where appropriate  we have taken prudent actions with our client to strengthen our credit position 
these actions reflect market terms and structures and are intended to improve the client s financial ability to perform 
impaired loans are assessed relative to the client s and guarantor s  if any  ability to service the debt  the loan terms  and the value of the property 
these factors are taken into consideration when formulating our alll through our credit risk rating and or specific reserving processes 
for the consumer portfolios  asset quality modestly improved  including early stage delinquencies  excluding guaranteed student loans  that declined during the year 
additionally  the level of nonperforming consumer loans and net charge offs declined compared to the year ended december we believe that our loan portfolio is well diversified by product  client  and geography throughout our footprint 
however  our loan portfolio may be exposed to certain concentrations of credit risk which exist in relation to individual borrowers or groups of borrowers  certain types of collateral  certain types of industries  certain loan products  or certain regions of the country

the alll decreased by million  down during the year ended december   with commercial  residential  and consumer loans related alll declining million  million  and million  respectively

the reserve for unfunded commitments was million as of december   a decrease of million  down compared to million at december  the decrease in the reserve was attributed to improved credit quality related to certain commercial and large corporate borrowers 
nonperforming assets as previously noted  while the reclassification of our loan types in had no effect on total npls  sec regulations require us  in some instances  to present five years of comparable data where trend information may be deemed relevant  in which case we have provided the pre adoption npl classifications due to the inability to restate prior periods under the post adoption classifications

the receivable amount related to proceeds due from fha or the va totaled million  million  and million at december    and  respectively 
includes million of consolidated loans eligible for repurchase from ginnie mae and classified as held for sale at december  nonaccruing restructured loans are included in total nonaccrual npls 
nonperforming assets decreased billion  down during the year ended december  the decrease was predominantly attributable to a billion reduction in npls as a result of our problem loan resolution efforts 
real estate related loans comprise a significant portion of our overall nonperforming assets as a result of the us housing market correction 
the amount of time necessary to obtain control of residential real estate collateral in certain states  primarily florida  has remained elevated due to delays in the foreclosure process 
these delays may impact the resolution of real estate related loans within the nonperforming assets portfolio 
overall  npl declines in recent quarters have been driven by commercial loans  as the higher risk commercial construction portfolio has been reduced  while the commercial and industrial loans have generally performed well 
as we look to the first quarter of  we expect the recent quarterly trends to continue  with a continued decline in npls 
nonperforming loans nonperforming commercial loans decreased million  down during the year ended december   driven by a million decrease in commercial construction npls and a million decrease in commercial and industrial npls 
we expect npls to continue to decline in the first quarter of  however  we continue to expect some variability in inflows of commercial real estate npls as we move through the current commercial real estate cycle 
nonperforming residential loans declined million  down during the year ended december   largely due to a million decrease in nonguaranteed residential mortgage npls  along with a million decline in residential construction npls 
the million decrease was partially attributable to the reclassification of certain nonperforming residential mortgages as held for sale to reflect our intention to sell these mortgages 
we recorded an incremental charge off of million in the first quarter in connection with the decision to transfer and sell these mortgages 
approximately million of these reclassified npls were sold during the second quarter  the remaining million were transferred back to lhfi as they were no longer deemed marketable for sale 
the remaining decrease was attributable to lower net charge offs and inflows of npls 
we expect some variability in inflows of nonperforming residential loans during related to mortgage loan repurchases from investors 
see additional discussion of mortgage loan repurchases in note  reinsurance arrangements and guarantees  to the consolidated financial statements in this form k 
nonperforming consumer loans decreased million  down during the year ended december   largely as a result of a million decrease in indirect consumer npls 
the decrease was driven by net charge offs of existing nonperforming consumer loans during the year  largely offset by the migration of delinquent consumer loans to nonaccrual status 
interest income on consumer and residential nonaccrual loans  if recognized  is recognized on a cash basis 
interest income on commercial nonaccrual loans is not recognized until after the principal has been reduced to zero 
we recognized million and million of interest income related to nonaccrual loans for the years ended december  and  respectively 
if all such loans had been accruing interest according to their original contractual terms  estimated interest income of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  would have been recognized 
other nonperforming assets oreo decreased million  down during the year ended december  the decline consisted of net decreases of million in residential homes and million in residential construction related properties  partially offset by a million increase in commercial properties 
during the years ended december  and  sales of oreo resulted in proceeds of million and million  respectively  and net losses on sales of oreo of million and million  respectively  inclusive of valuation reserves  primarily attributed to lots and land evaluated under the pooled approach 
sales of oreo and the related gains or losses are highly dependent on our disposition strategy and buyer opportunities 
see note  fair value election and measurement  to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for more information 
gains and losses on sale of oreo are recorded in other real estate expense in the consolidated statements of income loss 
geographically  most of our oreo properties are located in georgia  florida  and north carolina 
residential properties and land comprised and  respectively  of oreo  the remainder is related to commercial and other properties 
upon foreclosure  the values of these properties were reevaluated and  if necessary  written down to their then current estimated value  less costs to sell 
further declines in home prices could result in additional losses on these properties 
we are actively managing and disposing of these foreclosed assets to minimize future losses 
other repossessed assets decreased by million  down during the year ended december  the decrease was largely attributable to the sale of repossessed assets during the year 
the majority of our past due accruing loans are residential mortgages and student loans that are fully guaranteed by a federal agency 
accruing loans past due ninety days or more increased by million  up during the year ended december   essentially all of which was attributable to guaranteed residential mortgages and student loans 
at december  and  million and million  respectively  of past due accruing loans were not guaranteed 
at the end of  we completed an internal review of stm s residential foreclosure processes 
in  we continued to improve upon our processes as a result of our review 
in addition  following the federal reserve s horizontal review of the nation s largest mortgage loan servicers  suntrust and other servicers entered into consent orders with the frb 
we describe the consent order in note  contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements in this form k and a copy of it is filed as exhibit to this form k 
the consent order requires us to improve certain processes and to retain an independent consultant to conduct a review of residential foreclosure actions pending during and to identify any errors  misrepresentations or deficiencies  determine whether any instances so identified resulted in financial injury  and then make any appropriate remediation  reimbursement  or adjustment 
additionally  borrowers who had a residential foreclosure action pending during this two year review period have been solicited through advertising and direct mailings to request a review by the independent consultant of their case if they believe they incurred a financial injury as a result of errors  misrepresentations or other deficiencies in the foreclosure process 
a direct mail solicitation was completed on november  the deadline for submitting requests for review is july  these requirements prescribed by the consent order may result in additional delays in the foreclosure process at a time when the time required for foreclosure upon residential real estate collateral in certain states  primarily florida  continues to be elevated 
these delays in the foreclosure process have adversely affected us by increasing our expenses related to carrying such assets  such as taxes  insurance  and other carrying costs  and by exposing us to losses as a result of potential additional declines in the value of such collateral 
these delays have also resulted  in some cases  in an inability to meet certain investor foreclosure timelines for loans we service for others  which has resulted  and is expected to continue to result  in the assessment of compensatory fees 
noninterest expense in our mortgage line of business increased in as a result of the additional resources necessary to perform the foreclosure process assessment  revise affidavit filings and make any other operational changes 
additionally  continued and evolving changes in the regulatory environment and industry standards have increased our default servicing costs 
finally  the time to complete foreclosure sales has increased  and this has resulted in an increase in nonperforming assets and servicing advances  and has adversely impacted the collectability of such advances 
accordingly  additional delays in foreclosure sales  including any delays beyond those currently anticipated  our process enhancements  and any issues that may arise out of alleged irregularities in our foreclosure processes  could further increase the costs associated with our mortgage operations

nonaccruing restructured loans are included in total nonaccrual npls 
restructured loans to maximize the collection of loan balances  we evaluate troubled loans on a case by case basis to determine if a loan modification would be appropriate 
we pursue loan modifications when there is a reasonable chance that an appropriate modification would allow our client to continue servicing the debt 
for loans secured by residential real estate  if the client demonstrates a loss of income such that the client cannot reasonably support even a modified loan  we may pursue short sales and or deed in lieu arrangements 
for loans secured by income producing commercial properties  we perform a rigorous and ongoing programmatic review 
we review a number of factors  including cash flows  loan structures  collateral values  and guarantees  to identify loans within our income producing commercial loan portfolio that are most likely to experience distress 
based on our review of these factors and our assessment of overall risk  we evaluate the benefits of proactively initiating discussions with our clients to improve a loan s risk profile 
in some cases  we may renegotiate terms of their loans so that they have a higher likelihood of continuing to perform 
to date  we have restructured loans in a variety of ways to help our clients service their debt and to mitigate the potential for additional losses 
the primary restructuring methods being offered to our residential clients are reductions in interest rates and extensions of terms 
for commercial loans  the primary restructuring method is the extensions of terms 
accruing loans with modifications deemed to be economic concessions resulting from borrower difficulties are reported as accruing tdrs 
nonaccruing loans that are modified and demonstrate a history of repayment performance in accordance with their modified terms are reclassified to accruing restructured status  typically after six months of repayment performance 
generally  once a residential loan becomes a tdr  we expect that the loan will likely continue to be reported as a tdr for its remaining life even after returning to accruing status as the modified rates and terms at the time of modification were typically more favorable than those generally available in the market 
we note that some restructurings may not ultimately result in the complete collection of principal and interest as modified by the terms of the restructuring  culminating in default  which could result in additional incremental losses 
these potential incremental losses have been factored into our overall alll estimate through the use of loss forecasting methodologies 
roll rate models used to forecast losses on the residential mortgage and consumer tdrs are calculated and analyzed separately using their own portfolio attributes and history  thereby reflecting an increased pd compared to loans that have not been restructured 
the level of re defaults will likely be affected by future economic conditions 
at december  and  specific reserves included in the alll for residential tdrs were million and million  respectively 
see note  loans  to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for more information

accruing tdrs increased million  up during the year ended december  the increase in accruing tdrs was partly attributable to an increase in the number of loan modifications during the year and partly related to the adoption of new accounting guidance during applying the new guidance  which required a review and evaluation of loan modifications completed since january   resulted in the identification of million of additional tdrs as of july   which is the date the guidance became effective 
nonaccruing tdrs decreased by million  down during the year ended december   primarily reflecting net charge offs during the year  as well as returns of commercial tdrs to accrual status and repayments

the fair value of ars recorded in trading assets and included in table above declined to million as of december   compared to million as of december  the reduction was due predominantly to issuer redemptions of all of the remaining preferred equity ars  offset by additional purchases and a gain in fair value of the cdo ars

the size of the securities portfolio  at fair value  was billion as of december   an increase of billion  or  compared with december  changes in the size and composition of the portfolio during the year reflect our efforts to maintain a high quality portfolio and manage our interest rate risk profile 
these changes included reducing the size of the us treasury securities portfolio by billion  from which the proceeds were partly used to repurchase our series c and series d fixed rate cumulative preferred stock that we issued to the us treasury under the cpp 
over the course of the year  we also increased our agency mbs portfolio by billion in an effort to capture better relative value 
during the year ended december   we recorded million in net realized gains predominantly from the sale of securities afs as a result of the aforementioned activities in our portfolio  compared with net realized gains of million during the same period in for additional information on composition and valuation assumptions related to securities afs  see note  securities available for sale  and the trading assets and securities available for sale section of note  fair value election and measurement  to the consolidated financial statements in this form k

at december   the carrying value of securities afs reflected billion in net unrealized gains  which were comprised of a billion gross unrealized gain from our million shares of coke common stock and a million net unrealized gain on the remainder of the portfolio 
the net unrealized gain  excluding coke  increased due to the decline in interest rates experienced during the coke common stock is subject to variable forward agreements  which is discussed in the investment in common shares of the coca cola company section below 
for the year ended december   the average yield on a fte basis for the securities afs portfolio increased to compared with for the year ended december  the yield increases were predominantly due to reduced holdings of lower yielding us treasury securities and increased holdings of higher yielding agency mbs securities during the portfolio s effective duration decreased to as of december  from as of december  effective duration is a measure of price sensitivity of a bond portfolio to an immediate change in market interest rates  taking into consideration embedded options 
an effective duration of suggests an expected price change of for a one percent instantaneous change in market interest rates 
the credit quality of the securities portfolio remained strong at december  and  consequently  we have the flexibility to respond to changes in the economic environment and take actions as opportunities arise to manage our interest rate risk profile and balance liquidity against investment returns 
over the longer term  we continue to expect that a growing economy will result in loan balances trending up and deposits trending down 
accordingly  we may eventually decrease the size of our securities portfolio in response to loan growth and or declining deposits 
investment in common shares of the coca cola company background we have owned common shares of coke since  when one of our predecessor institutions participated in the underwriting of coke s ipo and received common shares of coke in lieu of underwriting fees 
these shares have grown in value over the past years and have been classified as securities afs  with unrealized gains  net of tax  recorded as a component of shareholders equity 
because of the low accounting cost basis of these shares  we have accumulated significant unrealized gains in shareholders equity 
as of december   we owned million coke shares with an accounting cost basis of  and a fair market value of billion 
we commenced a comprehensive balance sheet review initiative in early in an effort to improve liquidity and capital efficiency 
as part of this initiative  we began to formally evaluate the capital efficiency of our holdings of coke common shares  as we were prohibited from including the market value of our investment in coke common shares in tier capital in accordance with federal reserve capital adequacy rules 
as a result of this initiative  at various times during and we sold and made a charitable contribution of all but million shares of our coke stock 
additionally  during the second half of  we executed the agreements on the remaining million shares that we owned 
our primary objective in executing these transactions was to optimize the benefits we obtained from our long term holding of this asset  including the capital treatment by bank regulators 
we entered into the agreements  which were comprised of two variable forward agreements and share forward agreements effective july  with a major  unaffiliated financial institution the counterparty collectively covering our million coke shares 
under the agreements  we must deliver to the counterparty at settlement of the variable forward agreements either a variable number of coke common shares or a cash payment in lieu of such shares 
the counterparty is obligated to settle the agreements for no less than approximately per share  or approximately billion in the aggregate the minimum proceeds 
the share forward agreements give us the right  but not the obligation  to sell to the counterparty  at prevailing market prices at the time of settlement  any of the million coke common shares that are not delivered to the counterparty in settlement of the variable forward agreements 
the agreements effectively ensure that we will be able to sell our million coke common shares at a price no less than approximately per share  while permitting us to participate in future appreciation in the value of the coke common shares up to approximately per share and approximately per share  under each of the respective agreements 
the value of the agreements represent a million liability to us at december  during the terms of the agreements  and until we sell the million coke common shares  we generally will continue to receive dividends as declared and paid by coke and will have the right to vote such shares 
however  the amounts payable to us under the agreements will be adjusted if actual dividends are not equal to amounts expected at the inception of the derivative 
contemporaneously with entering into the agreements  the counterparty invested in senior unsecured promissory notes issued by the bank and suntrust collectively  the notes in a private placement in an aggregate principal amount equal to the minimum proceeds 
the notes carry stated maturities of approximately ten years from the effective date and bear interest at one month libor plus a fixed spread 
the counterparty pledged the notes to us and we pledged the million coke common shares to the counterparty  securing each entity s respective obligations under the agreements 
the pledged coke common shares are held by an independent third party custodian and the counterparty is prohibited under the agreements from selling  pledging  assigning  or otherwise using the pledged coke common shares in its business 
we generally may not prepay the notes 
the interest rate on the notes will be reset upon or after the settlement of the agreements  either through a remarketing process  or based upon dealer quotations 
in the event of an unsuccessful remarketing of the notes  we would be required to collateralize the notes and the maturity of the notes may accelerate to the first anniversary of the settlement of the agreements 
however  we presently believe that it is substantially certain that the notes will be successfully remarketed 
the agreements carry scheduled settlement terms of approximately seven years from the effective date 
however  we have the option to terminate the agreements earlier with the approval of the federal reserve 
the agreements may also terminate earlier upon certain events of default  extraordinary events regarding coke  and other typical termination events 
upon such early termination  there could be exit costs or gains  such as certain breakage fees including an interest rate make whole amount  associated with both the agreements and the notes 
such costs or gains may be material but cannot be determined at the present time due to the unlikely occurrence of such events and the number of variables that are unknown 
however  the payment of such costs  if any  will not result in us receiving less than the minimum proceeds from the agreements 
we expect to sell all of the coke common shares upon settlement of the agreements  either under the terms of the agreements or in another market transaction

these favorable trends were major drivers of the growth in net interest margin that we were able to achieve during the year 
average consumer and commercial deposits increased during by billion  up  compared with the growth was concentrated in noninterest bearing dda  money market  and savings accounts which increased billion  up 
the increase was partially offset by declines in consumer time and other time deposit account balances which decreased by billion  or 
these positive trends resulted from our continued marketing efforts  pricing discipline in the context of a low and declining rate environment  improving operational execution  as well as an industry wide preference for greater liquidity 
consumer and commercial deposit growth remains one of our key initiatives 
during  we continued focus on growing our client base  number of households  and deposit share while managing the rates we pay on our deposits 
overall growth was accomplished through a judicious use of competitive rates in select products and select geographies 
we experienced mixed results across our regions due to competitive forces and concentrations of time deposit clients  however  despite increased competition  we are up in eight of our ten largest msas 
other initiatives to attract deposits included enhanced product and features offerings  enhanced programs and initiatives  customer targeted offers  and advanced analytics that leverage product offerings with customer segmentation 
through our deposit transformation initiative  we delivered client focused banking solutions while responding to new regulations  such as the dodd frank act 
in addition  we provided client facing teammates with new tools that enhance their focus on providing clients with personalized options and an exceptional client experience

we terminated certain rccs in september we conducted a successful consent solicitation of the holders of our subordinated notes due which allowed us to terminate all of the rccs 
previously  the rccs limited our ability to repurchase certain of our hybrid capital securities which generally do not qualify as tier common equity 
on december   we issued  shares of perpetual preferred stock  series b  no par value and  liquidation preference per share the series b preferred stock 
the series b preferred stock has no stated maturity and will not be subject to any sinking fund or other obligation of suntrust 
dividends on the series b preferred stock  if declared  will accrue and be payable quarterly at a rate per annum equal to the greater of three month libor plus  or 
dividends on the shares are noncumulative 
shares of the series b preferred stock have priority over our common stock with regard to the payment of dividends 
as such  we may not pay dividends on or repurchase  redeem  or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of our common stock unless dividends for the series b preferred stock have been declared for that period  and sufficient funds have been set aside to make payment 
the series b preferred stock was immediately redeemable upon issuance at our option at a redemption price equal to  per share  plus any declared and unpaid dividends 
except in certain limited circumstances  the series b preferred stock does not have any voting rights 
during the year ended december   our common equity increased by billion  predominantly due to the common stock offering  net income  and an increase in aoci driven by higher unrealized gains from securities 
conversely  total shareholders equity decreased by billion from december   predominantly due to the repurchase of the series c and d preferred stock 
tier common equity  tier capital  and total capital ratios were   and  respectively  at december  compared with   and  respectively  at december  at december   our tier capital ratio excluding preferred stock issued to the us treasury was 
at december   our capital ratios remain strong and well in excess of current and proposed regulatory requirements to be considered well capitalized according to the current us regulatory standards 
also  tier common and tier capital ratios continue to be well above both basel i and basel iii regulatory requirements 
during the year ended december   we declared and paid common dividends totaling million  or per common share  compared with million  or per common share during the same period in additionally  we declared and paid dividends payable of million for both years ended december  and on our series a preferred stock 
further  during the years ended december  and  we declared and paid dividends payable of million and million  respectively  to the us treasury on the series c and d preferred stock 
our board approved an increase in the quarterly dividend to per share  which was paid on september   to shareholders of record at the close of business on september  however  we remain subject to certain restrictions on our ability to increase our dividend 
if we increase our quarterly dividend above per share prior to the tenth anniversary of our participation in the cpp  then the exercise price and the number of shares to be issued upon exercise of the warrants issued in connection with our participation in the cpp will be proportionately adjusted 
see part i  item a  risk factors  in this form k for additional considerations regarding the level of future dividends 
additionally  limits exist on the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the parent company 
substantially all of our retained earnings are undistributed earnings of the bank  which are restricted by various regulations administered by federal and state bank regulatory authorities 
there was no capacity for payment of cash dividends to the parent company under these regulations at december  however  at january   retained earnings of the bank available for payment of cash dividends to the parent company under these regulations totaled approximately million 
basel iii in september  the bcbs announced new regulatory capital requirements commonly referred to as basel iii aimed at substantially strengthening existing capital requirements  through a combination of higher minimum capital requirements  new capital conservation buffers  and more stringent definitions of capital and exposure 
basel iii would impose a new tier common equity requirement of  comprised of a minimum of plus a capital conservation buffer of 
the bcbs has also stated that from time to time it may require an additional  counter cyclical capital buffer on top of basel iii standards 
as this would only be included in periods of above average lending activity  it is not included in our calculations 
it is anticipated that us regulators will adopt new regulatory capital requirements similar to those proposed by the bcbs 
we monitor our capital structure as to compliance with current regulatory and prescribed operating levels and take into account these new regulations as they are published and become applicable to us in our capital planning 
the composition of our capital elements is likely to be impacted by the dodd frank act in at least two ways over the next several years 
first  the dodd frank act authorizes the federal reserve to enact prudential capital requirements which may require greater capital levels than presently required and which may vary among financial institutions based on size  risk  complexity  and other factors 
we expect the federal reserve to use this authority to implement the basel iii capital requirements  although this authority is not limited to the basel iii requirements 
second  a portion of the dodd frank act sometimes referred to as the collins amendment directs the federal reserve to adopt new capital requirements for certain bank holding companies  including us  which are at least as stringent as those applicable to insured depositary institutions  such as suntrust bank 
we expect that the federal reserve will apply these to us over a year period beginning january  and that  as a result  as of december   approximately billion in principal amount of parent company trust preferred and other hybrid capital securities currently outstanding  will no longer qualify for tier capital treatment at that time 
we will consider changes to our capital structure as these new regulations are published and become applicable to us 
the concept of tier common equity  the portion of tier capital that is common equity  was first introduced in the scap 
our regulator  rather than gaap  defines tier common equity and the tier common equity ratio 
as a result  our calculation of these measures may be different than those of other financial service companies who calculate them 
however  tier common equity and the tier common equity ratio continue to be important factors which regulators examine in evaluating financial institutions  therefore  we present these measures to allow for evaluations of our capital 
the transition period for banks to meet the revised common equity requirement will begin in  with full implementation in details for estimation of the basel iii tier common equity ratio are as follows table suntrust s estimation of basel iii tier common  pursuant to bcbs s june revision to the basel iii framework dollars in millions as of december  basel i tier common calculation adjustments net unrealized gains losses on afs securities unrealized losses on pension and post retirement plan held in aoci disallowed nol dta disallowed servicing assets overfunded pension asset net of dtl total calculation adjustments basel iii tier common capital basel i rwa calculation adjustments unrealized losses on pension and post retirement plan held in aoci additional rwa no longer required tier capital credit from unrealized gains on afs equity securities additional rwa no longer required additional market risk rwa additional msr rwa additional dta rwa disallowed servicing assets rwa adjustment no longer required adjustment to excess alll based on new rwa total calculation adjustments basel iii rwa basel iii tier common ratio these rules have not been finalized  so certain assumptions regarding their ultimate implementation have been made 
key assumptions are as follows adjustments to rwa for unrealized gains losses on afs portfolio pursuant to its definition of tier common equity  the basel iii proposals no longer apply an adjustment to remove unrealized gains or losses recognized on the balance sheet  except those specifically mentioned relating to the cash flow hedge reserve 
under basel i  consistent with the removal of these unrealized gains and losses from tier capital  the asset account reflecting these gains and losses though they are reflected pre tax is not subject to risk weighting  only the book values of the assets are risk weighted 
the basel iii proposals do not state whether the asset account reflecting the gains should now be risk weighted  and we make no assumptions or adjustments for this when estimating basel iii rwa 
risk weighting for msr assets we anticipate that basel iii as applied to us banks will use the current value of the msr asset net of any associated dtl to calculate the threshold deduction in the estimation of both basel iii tier common and basel iii rwa 
we believe this method of calculation is consistent with other large us banks 
cash flow hedge reserve adjustment the basel iii proposals state that the amount of cash flow hedge reserve that relates to the hedging of items that are not fair valued on the balance sheet should not be considered in calculating tier common 
we hold a portfolio of receive fixed pay variable swaps  which we use to hedge the cash flow volatility on pools of floating rate loans 
the unrealized gains on these positions are reflected on the balance sheet within shareholders equity in the aoci account  and we remove them as we do under basel i in the calculation of tier common for basel iii purposes 
it is unclear whether the unrealized gains on terminated positions  which are amortized through earnings based on the derivative s original maturity  could be included in tier common immediately 
we exclude all of these unrealized gains when estimating basel iii capital levels 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in detail in note  significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements in this form k and are integral to understanding our financial performance 
we have identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require judgment about matters that are highly uncertain and different estimates that could be reasonably applied would result in materially different assessments with respect to ascertaining the valuation of assets  liabilities  commitments  and contingencies 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset  valuing an asset or liability  or reducing a liability 
our accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with us gaap  and they conform to general practices within the financial services industry 
we have established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure that these critical accounting estimates are well controlled  applied consistently from period to period  and the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner 
the following is a description of our current critical accounting policies 
contingencies we face uncertainty with respect to the ultimate outcomes of various contingencies including the allowance for credit losses  mortgage repurchase reserves  and legal and regulatory matters 
allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses is composed of the alll and the reserve for unfunded commitments 
the alll represents our estimate of probable losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the alll is increased by the provision for credit losses and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the alll is determined based on our review and evaluation of larger loans that meet our definition of impairment and the current risk characteristics of pools of homogeneous loans ie  loans having similar characteristics within the loan portfolio and our assessment of internal and external influences on credit quality that are not fully reflected in the historical loss or risk rating data 
large commercial nonaccrual loans and certain commercial  consumer  and residential loans whose terms have been modified in a tdr  are individually evaluated to determine the amount of specific allowance required using the most probable source of repayment  including the present value of the loan s expected future cash flows  the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs of disposition  or the loan s estimated market value 
in these measurements  we use assumptions and methodologies that are relevant to estimating the level of impairment and unrealized losses in the portfolio 
to the extent that the data supporting such assumptions has limitations  our judgment and experience play a key role in enhancing the specific alll estimates 
key judgments used in determining the alll include internal risk ratings  market and collateral values  discount rates  loss rates  and our view of current economic conditions 
general allowances are established for loans and leases grouped into pools that have similar characteristics  including smaller balance homogeneous loans 
the alll committee estimates probable losses by evaluating quantitative and qualitative factors for each loan portfolio segment  including net charge off trends  internal risk ratings  changes in internal risk ratings  loss forecasts  collateral values  geographic location  delinquency rates  nonperforming and restructured loans  origination channel  product mix  underwriting practices  industry conditions  and economic trends 
in addition to these factors  the consumer and residential portfolio segments consider borrower fico scores and the commercial portfolio segment considers single name borrower concentration 
estimated collateral valuations are based on appraisals  broker price opinions  recent sales of foreclosed properties  automated valuation models  other property specific information  and relevant market information  supplemented by our internal property valuation professionals 
the value estimate is based on an orderly disposition and marketing period of the property 
in limited instances  we adjust externally provided appraisals for justifiable and well supported reasons  such as an appraiser not being aware of certain property specific factors or recent sales information 
appraisals generally represent the as is value of the property but may be adjusted based on the intended disposition strategy of the property 
our determination of the alll for commercial loans and leases is sensitive to the assigned internal risk ratings for pd and lgd 
assuming a downgrade of one level in the pd risk ratings for commercial loans and leases  the alll would have increased by approximately million at december  in the event that estimated loss severity rates for the entire commercial loan portfolio increased by percent  the alll for the commercial portfolio would increase by approximately million at december  our determination of the allowance for residential and consumer loans is also sensitive to changes in estimated loss severity rates 
in the event that estimated loss severity rates for the residential and consumer loan portfolio increased by percent  the alll for the residential and consumer portfolios would increase  in total  by approximately million at december  because several quantitative and qualitative factors are considered in determining the alll  these sensitivity analyses do not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the alll 
they are intended to provide insights into the impact of adverse changes in risk rating and estimated loss severity rates and do not imply any expectation of future deterioration in the risk ratings or loss rates 
given current processes employed  management believes the risk ratings and inherent loss rates currently assigned are appropriate 
it is possible that others  given the same information  may at any point in time reach different reasonable conclusions that could be material to our financial statements 
in addition to the alll  we also estimate probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments  such as letters of credit and binding unfunded loan commitments 
unfunded lending commitments are analyzed and segregated by risk similar to funded loans based on our internal risk rating scale 
these risk classifications  in combination with an analysis of historical loss experience  probability of commitment usage  and any other pertinent information  result in the estimation of the reserve for unfunded lending commitments 
our financial results are affected by the changes in and the absolute level of the allowance for credit losses 
this process involves our analysis of complex internal and external variables  and it requires that we exercise judgment to estimate an appropriate allowance for credit losses 
as a result of the uncertainty associated with this subjectivity  we cannot assure the precision of the amount reserved should we experience sizeable loan or lease losses in any particular period 
for example  changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers  economic conditions  or the condition of various markets in which collateral may be sold could require us to significantly decrease or increase the level of the allowance for credit losses 
such an adjustment could materially affect net income as a result of the change in provision for credit losses 
during the last three years  we have experienced elevated delinquencies and net charge offs in residential real estate loans due to the deterioration of the housing market 
these market conditions were considered in deriving the estimated allowance for credit losses  however  given the continued economic challenges and uncertainties  the ultimate amount of loss could vary from that estimate 
for additional discussion of the alll see the allowance for credit losses and nonperforming assets sections in this md a as well as note  loans  and note  allowance for credit losses  to the consolidated financial statements in this form k 
mortgage repurchase reserve we sell residential mortgage loans to investors through whole loan sales in the normal course of our business 
prior to we also sold loans to investors through securitizations 
in association with these transactions  we provide representations and warranties to the third party investors that these loans meet certain requirements as agreed to in investor guidelines 
in the last few years  we have seen a significant increase in claims from investors regarding material breaches of these representations and warranties resulting in an elevated level in the repurchase liability 
the majority of the losses incurred have related to loans sold to investors from to we have experienced significantly fewer repurchase claims and losses related to loans sold since as a result of stronger credit performance  more stringent credit guidelines  and underwriting process improvements 
repurchase requests received since have totaled billion which includes ginnie mae repurchase demands 
the following table summarizes demand activity for the years ended december repurchase request activity table dollars in millions beginning pending repurchase requests repurchase requests received repurchase requests resolved repurchased cured total resolved ending pending repurchase requests percent from non agency investors repurchase requests received pending repurchase requests as presented in the table above  repurchase requests increased in with most of the increase occurring in the latter half of the year 
this increase was related to loans sold to fnma from to  primarily those sold in the repurchase requests received continue to be concentrated in loans that are seriously delinquent or have already been through the foreclosure process 
the following table summarizes the original principal balance of loans sold from to  excluding loans sold to ginnie mae  as well as the cumulative default rate and repurchase request rate 
original principal balance sold table dollars in billions total sold unpaid principal balance gses non agency total sold unpaid principal balance ever days past due ever days past due sold unpaid principal balance total repurchase requests received total repurchase requests ever days past due includes estimates for delinquent loans sold servicing released as previously noted  repurchase requests received during primarily related to loans sold in the volume of repurchase requests from a particular sale vintage is driven by several factors 
the primary factor is the volume of defaulted loans 
as shown above  the largest volume of defaulted loans is from due to the volume of sales during that year  combined with the credit guidelines applicable to loans originated during that period 
to date  repurchase request volumes were also driven by the inverse relationship between repurchase requests and the amount of time between origination and default 
that is  the shorter the timeframe between origination and default  the greater the repurchase request volume  and the longer the timeframe  the lower the repurchase request volume 
because of this relationship  fewer repurchase requests received during were from loans sold prior to and  to a lesser extent  while requests from loans sold in and were higher 
another factor is the investor selection and review process 
we believe that the gses have primarily focused on defaulted loans that have been through the foreclosure process and have been less focused on outstanding loans that are seriously delinquent 
we believe this is because the final resolution of an outstanding delinquent loan is not certain and also due to the backlog of foreclosed loans 
however  we have recently noticed some change in the pattern of requests 
the more recent selections  as evidenced by the gses requests for full loan files  have shifted towards outstanding loans that are seriously delinquent 
this could suggest that the gses are working through the backlog of defaulted loans from prior years and that the repurchase requests in the latter half of were due to an acceleration of timing of repurchase requests as opposed to an increase in the total population of requests 
our liability for losses resulting from loan repurchases is initially based upon the fair value of these guarantees 
subsequently  the liability is reduced in proportion to the reduction in risk as actual losses are incurred  and additions to the liability are made for our estimate of incurred losses 
the liability is calculated by sales vintage based on various factors including pending repurchase demands  the population of loans that have ever been or more days past due  including loans currently delinquent that are expected to migrate to days past due  the probability that a repurchase request related to a loan that has ever been or more days past due will be received  the probability that a loan demanded for repurchase will be repurchased  and historical loss experience 
the previous table presented historical information regarding the population of defaulted loans and repurchase request rates 
the following table presents historical information regarding the repurchase rates and loss severity for loans sold between to repurchase rates and loss severity table dollars in billions total repurchased cured pending total repurchase requests received repurchase rate losses recognized loss severity loss severity last months some of the assumptions used in the reserve process contain a level of uncertainty since they are largely derived from historical experience that has been limited and highly variable 
as such  provision expense will vary as the estimates used to measure the liability continue to be updated based on the level of repurchase requests  the latest experience gained on repurchase requests  and other relevant facts and circumstances 
one of the most critical and judgmental assumptions is the repurchase request rate because it requires us to make assessments regarding the actions that will be taken by third party investors in the context of the highly variable history we have experienced with their current volume and timing of requests 
once we estimate the level of requests that we expect to receive by vintage  we apply factors for the probability that a loan will be repurchased as well as the loss severity expected 
our life to date repurchase rates are consistent with future expectations  however  given changes in housing prices over the past several years  we believe the loss severity over the past months will be more indicative of our future loss severity rate 
our current estimated liability for contingent losses related to loans sold was million as of december  the liability is recorded in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets  and the related repurchase provision is recognized in mortgage production related loss income in the consolidated statements of income loss 
various factors could potentially impact the accuracy of the assumptions underlying our mortgage repurchase reserve estimate 
as previously discussed  the level of repurchase requests we receive is dependent upon the actions of third parties and could differ from the assumptions that we have made 
delinquency levels  delinquency roll rates  and our loss severity assumptions are all highly dependent upon economic factors including changes in real estate values and unemployment levels which are  by nature  difficult to predict 
loss severity assumptions could also be negatively impacted by delays in the foreclosure process which is a heightened risk in some of the states where our loans sold were originated 
approximately of the population of total loans sold between january  and december  were sold to non agency investors  some in the form of securitizations 
due to the nature of these structures and the indirect ownership interests  the potential exists that investors  over time  will become more successful in forcing additional repurchase demands 
while we have used the best information available in estimating the mortgage repurchase reserve liability  these and other factors  along with the discovery of additional information in the future could result in changes in our assumptions which could materially impact our results of operations 
see noninterest income in this md a and note  reinsurance arrangements and guarantees loan sales  to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for further discussion 
legal and regulatory matters we are parties to numerous claims and lawsuits arising in the course of our normal business activities  some of which involve claims for substantial amounts  and the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time 
management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss  if any  in preparing our financial statements 
we evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party 
we record a liability for such claims when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
our estimates are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings  the merits of our defenses and consultation with in house and outside legal counsel 
in many such proceedings  it is not possible to determine whether a liability has been incurred or to estimate the ultimate or minimum amount of that liability until the matter is close to resolution 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and may revise our estimates 
due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate  our estimates may be materially different than the actual outcomes  which could have material effects on our business  financial conditions and results of operations 
however  it is the opinion of management that liabilities arising from these claims in excess of the amounts currently accrued  if any  will not have a material adverse impact to the company s financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
see note  contingencies  and note  subsequent event  to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for further discussion 
estimates of fair value fair value is the price that could be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
certain of our assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
examples of recurring uses of fair value include derivative instruments  afs and trading securities  certain lhfi and lhfs  certain issuances of long term debt  and msrs 
we also measure certain assets at fair value on a non recurring basis either when such assets are carried at the locom  to evaluate assets for impairment  or for disclosure purposes 
examples of these non recurring uses of fair value include certain lhfs  oreo  goodwill  intangible assets  nonmarketable equity securities  certain partnership investments  and long lived assets 
depending on the nature of the asset or liability  we use various valuation techniques and assumptions when estimating fair value 
the objective of fair value is to use market based inputs or assumptions  when available  to estimate the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
where observable market prices from transactions for identical assets or liabilities are not available  we identify what we believe to be similar assets or liabilities 
if observable market prices are unavailable or impracticable to obtain for any such similar assets or liabilities  we look to other techniques by obtaining third party quotes or using modeling techniques  such as discounted cash flows  while attempting to utilize market observable assumptions to the extent available 
absent current market activity in that specific instrument or a similar instrument  the resulting valuation approach may require making a number of significant judgments in the estimation of fair value 
market conditions during the credit crisis led to limited or nonexistent trading in certain of the financial asset classes that we have owned 
the lack of liquidity and low level of activity in these markets creates additional challenges when estimating the fair value of related financial instruments 
generally  the assets and liabilities most affected by the lack of liquidity are those required to be classified as level in the fair value hierarchy 
as a result  various processes and controls have been adopted to determine that appropriate methodologies  techniques and assumptions are used in the development of fair value estimates  particularly related to those instruments that require the use of significant  unobservable inputs 
we continue to maintain a cross functional approach when estimating the fair value of these difficult to value financial instruments 
this includes input from not only the related line of business  but also from risk management and finance  to ultimately arrive at a consensus estimate of the instrument s fair value after evaluating all available information pertaining to fair value 
this process has involved the gathering of multiple sources of information  including broker quotes  values provided by pricing services  trading activity in other similar instruments  market indices  and pricing matrices along with employing various modeling techniques  such as discounted cash flow analyses  in arriving at the best estimate of fair value 
modeling techniques incorporate our assessments regarding assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or the liability  including market based assumptions  such as interest rates  as well as assumptions about the risks inherent in a particular valuation technique  the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset  market liquidity  and the risk of nonperformance 
in certain cases  our assessments with respect to assumptions that market participants would make may be inherently difficult to determine  and the use of different assumptions could result in material changes to these fair value measurements 
we used significant unobservable inputs to fair value  on a recurring basis  for certain trading assets  securities afs  portfolio loans accounted for at fair value  irlcs  lhfs  msrs and certain derivatives 
overall  the financial impact of the level financial instruments did not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital 
our exposure to level financial instruments continues to decline due to paydowns  sales and settlements of these instruments and minimal purchases 
the following table discloses assets and liabilities that have been impacted by level fair value determinations 
level assets and liabilities table as of december  dollars in millions trading assets securities afs lhfs lhfi other intangible assets other assets total level assets total assets total assets measured at fair value level assets as a percent of total assets level assets as a percent of total assets measured at fair value trading liabilities other liabilities  total level liabilities total liabilities total liabilities measured at fair value level liabilities as a percent of total liabilities level liabilities as a percent of total liabilities measured at fair value msrs carried at fair value includes irlcs includes visa derivative the following discussion provides further information on fair value accounting by balance sheet category including the difficult to value assets and liabilities displayed in the table above 
trading assets and liabilities and securities afs in estimating the fair values for the majority of securities afs and trading instruments  including residual and certain other retained securitization interests  fair values are based on observable market prices of the same or similar instruments 
specifically  the majority of trading assets and liabilities are priced by the respective trading desk and the majority of securities afs are priced by an independent third party pricing service 
the company has an internal  yet independent validation function in place to evaluate the appropriateness of the marks received from third party pricing services 
for trading securities and securities afs in active trading markets  this can be done by comparing the marks against two to three other widely used third party pricing services or sources 
for less liquid instruments  we evaluate third party pricing to determine the reasonableness of the information relative to changes in market data such as any recent trades we executed  market information received from outside market participants and analysts  and or changes in the underlying collateral performance 
we also gather third party broker quotes or use industry standard or proprietary models to estimate the fair value of these instruments particularly when pricing service information or observable market trades are not available 
in most cases  the current market conditions caused the broker quotes to be indicative and the price indications and broker quotes to be supported by very limited to no recent market activity 
in those instances  we weighted the third party information according to our judgment of it being a reasonable indication of the instrument s fair value 
when fair values are estimated based on models  we consider relevant market indices that correlate to the underlying collateral  along with assumptions such as liquidity discounts  interest rates  prepayment speeds  default rates  loss severity rates  and discount rates 
as liquidity returns to certain markets  we have more pricing information from third parties and a reduction in the need to use internal pricing models to estimate fair value 
even though limited third party pricing has been available  we continued to classify certain assets as level as we believe that this third party pricing relied on significant unobservable assumptions  as evidenced by a persistently wide bid ask price range and variability in pricing from the pricing services  particularly for the vintages and exposures we hold 
as certain markets recover  we are able to reduce our exposure to many of our level instruments through sales  maturities  or other distributions at prices approximating our previous estimates  thereby corroborating the valuation approaches used 
many of our remaining level securities  however  will be held until final distribution or maturity 
while it is difficult to accurately predict the ultimate cash value of these securities  we believe the amount that would be ultimately realized if the securities were held to settlement or maturity will generally be similar to or greater than the current fair value of the securities classified as level this assessment is based on the current performance of the underlying collateral  which is experiencing elevated losses but generally not to the degree that correlates to current market values  which reflect downward pressure due to liquidity issues and other broader macro economic conditions 
it is reasonably likely that market volatility for certain instruments will continue as a result of a variety of external factors 
this lack of liquidity has caused us to evaluate the performance of the underlying collateral and to use a discount rate commensurate with the rate a market participant would use to value the instrument in an orderly transaction  but that also acknowledges illiquidity premiums and required investor rates of return that would be demanded under current market conditions 
the discount rate considered the capital structure of the instrument  market indices  and the relative yields of instruments for which third party pricing information and or market activity was available 
in certain instances  the interest rate and credit risk components of the valuation indicated a full return of expected principal and interest  however  the lack of liquidity resulted in wide ranges of discounts in valuing certain level instruments 
the illiquidity that continues to persist in certain markets requires discounts of this degree to drive a market competitive yield  as well as to account for the anticipated extended tenor 
the discount rates selected derived reasonable prices when compared to i observable transactions  when available  ii other securities on a relative basis  iii the bid ask spread of non binding broker indicative bids and or iv our professional judgment 
all of the techniques used and information obtained in the valuation process provides a range of estimated values  which were evaluated and compared in order to establish an estimated value that  based on management s judgment  represented a reasonable estimate of the instrument s fair value 
it was not uncommon for the range of value of these instruments to vary widely  in such cases  we selected an estimated value that we believed was the best indication of value based on the yield a market participant in this current environment would expect 
due to the continued illiquidity and credit risk of level securities  these market values are highly sensitive to assumption changes and market volatility 
improvements may be made to our pricing methodologies on an ongoing basis as observable and relevant information becomes available to us 
see note  fair value election and measurement  to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for a detailed discussion regarding level and securities and valuation methodologies for each class of securities 
most derivative instruments are level or level instruments  except for the irlcs  the visa litigation related derivative  discussed below  and the agreements we entered into related to our investment in coke common stock  which are level instruments 
because the value of the agreements is primarily driven by the embedded equity collars on the coke common shares  a black scholes model is the appropriate valuation model 
most of the assumptions are directly observable from the market  such as the per share market price of coke common stock  interest rates  and the dividend rate on coke common stock 
volatility is a significant assumption and is impacted both by the unusually large size of the trade and the long tenor until settlement 
the agreements carry scheduled terms of approximately six and a half and seven years from the effective date  and as such  the observable and active options market on coke does not provide for any identical or similar instruments 
as a result  we receive estimated market values from a market participant who is knowledgeable about coke equity derivatives and is active in the market 
based on inquiries of the market participant as to their procedures as well as our own valuation assessment procedures  we have satisfied ourselves that the market participant is using methodologies and assumptions that other market participants would use in arriving at the fair value of the agreements 
at december   the coke derivative liability was valued at million and was included within the level trading liabilities portfolio 
at december   level trading assets and level securities afs totaled million and billion  respectively 
our level securities afs portfolio included fhlb and federal reserve bank stock  as well as certain municipal bond securities  some of which are only redeemable with the issuer at par and cannot be traded in the market  as such  no significant observable market data for these instruments is available 
these nonmarketable securities afs totaled approximately million at december  the remaining level securities  both trading assets and securities afs  are predominantly private abs and mbs and cdos  including interests retained from company sponsored securitizations or purchased from third party securitizations 
we also have exposure to bank trust preferred cdos  student loan abs  and municipal securities due to our purchase of certain ars as a result of failed auctions 
for all level securities  little or no market activity exists for either the security or the underlying collateral and therefore the significant assumptions used to value the securities are not market observable 
level trading assets declined by million  or  during the year ended december   primarily due to sales  paydowns  redemptions  and maturities of securities  partially offset by net unrealized mark to market gains and a small amount of purchases 
level securities afs declined by million  or  during the year ended december   due to continued paydowns and redemptions by issuers of securities  partially offset by net unrealized mark to market gains and a small amount of fhlb of atlanta stock purchases 
during the year ended december   we recognized through earnings million in net gains related to trading assets and liabilities and securities afs classified as level loans the fair values of lhfi and lhfs are based on observable current market prices in the secondary loan market in which loans trade  as either whole loans or as abs 
when securities prices are obtained in the secondary loan market  we will translate these prices into whole loan prices by incorporating adjustments for estimated credit enhancement costs  loan servicing fees  and various other transformation costs  when material 
the fair value of a loan is impacted by the nature of the asset and the market liquidity 
level loans are predominantly mortgage loans that have been deemed not marketable  largely due to borrower defaults or the identification of other loan defects 
when estimating fair value for these loans  we use a discounted cash flow approach based on assumptions that are generally not observable in the current markets  such as prepayment speeds  default rates  loss severity rates  and liquidity discounts 
absent comparable current market data  we believe that the fair value derived from these various approaches is a reasonable approximation of the prices that we would receive upon sale of the loans 
other intangible assets and other assets beginning january   we began recording all msrs at fair value on a recurring basis 
the fair value of msrs is based on discounted cash flow analyses and can be highly variable quarter to quarter as market conditions and projected interest rates change 
we provide disclosure of the key economic assumptions used to measure msrs and residual interests and a sensitivity analysis to adverse changes to these assumptions in note  goodwill and other intangible assets  to the consolidated financial statements in this form k 
this sensitivity analysis does not take into account hedging activities discussed in the other market risk section of this md a 
the fair values of oreo and other repossessed assets are typically determined based on recent appraisals by third parties and other market information 
our oreo properties are concentrated in georgia  florida  and north carolina 
further deterioration in property values in those states or changes to our disposition strategies could cause our estimates of oreo values to decline which would result in further write downs 
estimates of fair value are also required when performing an impairment analysis of goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets 
for long lived assets  including intangible assets subject to amortization  an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
in determining the fair value  management uses models which require assumptions about growth rates  the life of the asset  and or the market value of the assets 
we test long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that our carrying amount may not be recoverable 
other liabilities during the second quarter of  in connection with our sale of visa class b shares  we entered into a derivative contract whereby the ultimate cash payments received or paid  if any  under the contract are based on the ultimate resolution of litigation involving visa 
the value of the derivative is estimated based on our expectations regarding the ultimate resolution of that litigation  which involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity 
as a result  the value of the derivative liability was classified as a level instrument 
at december   the visa derivative liability was valued at million and was included within other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
see note  reinsurance arrangements and guarantees  to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for further discussion 
the fair value methodology and assumptions related to our irlcs is described in note  fair value election and measurement  to the consolidated financial statements in this form k 
goodwill as of december  and  our reporting units with goodwill balances are branch banking  diversified commercial banking  cib  and w im 
branch banking is a component of the retail banking reportable segment 
see note  business segment reporting  to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for a further discussion of our reportable segments 
we review the goodwill of each reporting unit for impairment on an annual basis as of september th  or more often  if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is below the carrying value of its equity 
the goodwill impairment analysis estimates the fair value of equity using discounted cash flow analyses which require assumptions  as well as guideline company and guideline transaction information  where available 
the inputs and assumptions specific to each reporting unit are incorporated in the valuations  including projections of future cash flows  discount rates  the fair value of tangible assets and intangible assets and liabilities  and applicable valuation multiples based on the guideline information 
we assess the reasonableness of the estimated fair value of the reporting units by giving consideration to our market capitalization over a reasonable period of time  however  supplemental information is applied based on observable multiples from guideline transactions  adjusted to reflect our specific factors  as well as current market conditions 
based on our annual impairment analysis of goodwill as of september   we determined there is no goodwill impairment as the fair value for all reporting units is in excess of the respective reporting unit s carrying value by the following percentages branch banking diversified commercial banking cib w im we monitored events and circumstances during the fourth quarter of and performed an interim impairment test for branch banking 
we found that its fair value had not changed since performing our annual test 
valuation techniques in determining the fair value of our reporting units  we use discounted cash flow analyses  which require assumptions about short and long term net cash flow  growth rates for each reporting unit  as well as discount rates 
additionally  we consider guideline company and guideline transaction information  where available  to aid in the valuation of certain reporting units 
growth assumptions multi year financial forecasts are developed for each reporting unit by considering several key business drivers such as new business initiatives  client service and retention standards  market share changes  anticipated loan and deposit growth  forward interest rates  historical performance  and industry and economic trends  among other considerations 
the long term growth rate used in determining the terminal value of each reporting unit was estimated at as of september  and based on management s assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of each reporting unit  as well as broader economic considerations such as gross domestic product and inflation 
discount rate assumptions discount rates are estimated based on the capital asset pricing model  which considers the risk free interest rate  market risk premium  beta  and unsystematic risk and size premium adjustments specific to a particular reporting unit 
the discount rates are also calibrated based on the assessment of the risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit 
in the annual analysis as of september   the discount rates ranged from to 
estimated fair value and sensitivities the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is derived from the valuation techniques described above 
the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is analyzed in relation to numerous market and historical factors  including current economic and market conditions  company specific growth opportunities  and guideline company and guideline transaction information 
economic and market conditions can vary significantly which may cause increased volatility in a company s stock price  resulting in a temporary decline in market capitalization 
in those circumstances  current market capitalization may not be an accurate indication of a market participant s estimate of entity specific value measured over a reasonable period of time 
we believe that recent volatility may be tied to concerns related to a rating agency downgrade of the us credit rating  market sentiment pertaining to the overall banking sector and concerns regarding the global economy  rather than the result of company specific adjustments to cash flows  guideline multiples  or asset values which would have influenced the fair value of our reporting units 
as a result  the use of market capitalization is a less relevant measure to assess the reasonableness of the aggregate value of the reporting units 
therefore  we supplement the market capitalization information with other observable market information that provided benchmark valuation multiples from transactions over a reasonable period 
the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is highly sensitive to changes in these estimates and assumptions  therefore  in some instances  changes in these assumptions could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value 
we perform sensitivity analyses around these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values 
ultimately  future potential changes in these assumptions may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value 
additionally  a reporting unit s carrying value of equity could change based on market conditions and the risk profile of those reporting units 
if there is a situation where the carrying value of equity exceeds the estimated fair value  an additional goodwill impairment evaluation is performed that involves calculating the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  which is determined in the same manner as goodwill is recognized in a business combination 
the value of the implied goodwill is highly sensitive to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit s net assets 
the fair value of the reporting unit s net assets is estimated using a variety of valuation techniques including the following recent data observed in the market  including similar assets  cash flow modeling based on projected cash flows and market discount rates  market indices  estimated net realizable value of the underlying collateral  and price indications from independent third parties 
observable market information is utilized to the extent available and relevant 
the estimated fair values reflect management s assumptions regarding how a market participant would value the net assets and includes appropriate credit  liquidity  and market risk premiums that are indicative of the current environment 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill for the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the goodwill for the respective reporting unit  goodwill is not impaired 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
changes in the estimated fair value of the individual assets and liabilities may result in a different amount of implied goodwill  and ultimately  the amount of goodwill impairment  if any 
sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the potential ranges of implied goodwill 
income taxes we are subject to the income tax laws of the us  its states and municipalities where we conduct business 
we estimate income tax expense based on amounts expected to be owed to these various tax jurisdictions 
the estimated income tax expense or benefit is reported in the consolidated statements of income loss 
accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received from tax jurisdictions either currently or in the future and are reported in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
in estimating accrued taxes  we assess the appropriate tax treatment of transactions and filing positions after considering statutes  regulations  judicial precedent  and other pertinent information 
the income tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant government taxing authorities 
significant judgment is required in determining the tax accruals and in evaluating our tax positions  including evaluating uncertain tax positions 
changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates  interpretations of tax laws  the status of examinations by the tax authorities  and newly enacted statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance that could impact the relative merits and risks of tax positions 
these changes  when they occur  impact tax expense and can materially affect our operating results 
we review our tax positions quarterly and make adjustments to accrued taxes as new information becomes available 
deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future years 
such assets arise due to temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities  as well as from nol and tax credit carryforwards 
we regularly evaluate the realizability of dtas 
a valuation allowance is recognized for a dta if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the dta will not be realized 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary  we consider the level of taxable income in prior years to the extent that carrybacks are permitted under current tax laws  as well as estimates of future pre tax and taxable income and tax planning strategies that would  if necessary  be implemented 
we currently maintain a valuation allowance associated with dtas for certain state carryforwards 
we expect to realize our remaining dtas over the allowable carryback and or carryforward periods 
therefore  no valuation allowance is deemed necessary against our federal or remaining state dtas as of december  for additional information  refer to note  income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements in this form k 
pension accounting several variables affect the annual cost for our retirement programs 
the main variables are size and characteristics of the employee population  discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets  recognition of actual asset returns  other actuarial assumptions and healthcare cost 
below is a brief description of each variable and the effect it has on our pension costs 
see note  employee benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for additional information 
size and characteristics of the employee population pension cost is directly related to the number of employees covered by the plans  and other factors including salary  age  years of employment  and benefit terms 
on november   we announced the curtailment of all pension benefit accruals as of december  the pension curtailment led to a remeasurement of pension obligations as of november  and adjustment of pension costs accrued after that date 
prior to the pension curtailment  most employees who had or more years of service as of december  received benefits based on a traditional pension formula with benefits linked to employees final average pays and years of service 
most other employees received a traditional pension for periods prior to plus a cash balance benefit based on annual compensation and interest credits earned after discount rate the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit obligations 
the discount rate for each plan is determined by matching the expected cash flows of each plan to a yield curve based on long term  high quality fixed income debt instruments available as of the date obligations are measured 
the discount rate for each plan is reset annually or upon occurrence of a triggering event on the measurement date to reflect current market conditions 
as mentioned above  the pension curtailment on november  caused a remeasurement and a reset of the discount rates 
see note  employee benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for discussion of the rate resets 
if we were to assume a increase decrease in the discount rate for all retirement and other postretirement plans  and keep all other assumptions constant  the benefit cost would decrease increase by less than million 
expected long term rate of return on plan assets expected returns on plan assets are computed using long term rate of return assumptions which are selected after considering plan investments  historical returns  and potential future returns 
our pension costs reflect an assumed long term rate of return on plan assets of up to the november  remeasurement date  and for the period november  to december   and after december  for the impacted plans 
any differences between expected and actual returns are included in the unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss amount 
we amortize gains losses in pension expense when the total unamortized amount exceeds of plan assets or the projected benefit obligations  whichever is greater 
effective with the november  plan curtailment announcement  all pension gains or losses are being amortized over participants average expected future lifetime  which is approximately years 
prior to november   the amortization period for pension plan with ongoing benefit accruals was based on the average expected future service of active employees  which is approximately years 
see note  employee benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for details on changes in the pension benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets 
if we were to assume a increase decrease in the expected long term rate of return for the retirement and other postretirement plans  holding all other actuarial assumptions constant  the benefit cost would decrease increase by approximately million 
recognition of actual asset returns accounting guidance allows for the use of an asset value that smoothes investment gains and losses over a period up to five years 
however  we have elected to use a preferable method in determining pension cost 
this method uses the actual market value of the plan assets 
therefore  we will experience more variability in the annual pension cost  as the asset values will be more volatile than companies who elected to smooth their investment experience 
other actuarial assumptions to estimate the projected benefit obligation  actuarial assumptions are required about factors such as mortality rate  turnover rate  retirement rate  disability rate  and the rate of compensation increases 
these factors do not tend to change significantly over time  so the range of assumptions  and their impact on pension cost  is generally limited 
we annually review the assumptions used based on historical and expected future experience 
healthcare cost assumed healthcare cost trend rates also have an impact on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans 
due to changing medical inflation  it is important to understand the effect of a one percent change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates 
if we were to assume a one percent increase in healthcare cost trend rates  the effect on the other postretirement benefit obligation and total interest and service cost would be an million and million increase  respectively 
if we were to assume a one percent decrease in healthcare trend rates  the effect on the other postretirement benefit obligation and total interest and service cost would be a million and million decrease  respectively 
to estimate the projected benefit obligation as of december   we projected forward the benefit obligations from january  to december   adjusting for benefit payments  expected growth in the benefit obligations  changes in key assumptions and plan provisions  and any significant changes in the plan demographics that occurred during the year  including where appropriate subsidized early retirements  salary changes different from expectations  entrance of new participants  changes in per capita claims cost  medicare part d subsidy  and retiree contributions 
enterprise risk management in the normal course of business  we are exposed to various risks 
we have established an enterprise risk governance framework to manage these risks and to provide reasonable assurance that key business objectives will be achieved 
underlying this framework are limits  policies  processes  and procedures designed to effectively identify  monitor  and manage risk 
the board is wholly responsible for oversight of enterprise risk governance 
the risk committee of the board assists the board in executing this responsibility 
administration of the framework and governance process is the responsibility of the cro  who executes this responsibility through the crm organization 
the cro reports to the chief executive officer  and provides overall vision  direction  and leadership regarding our enterprise risk management framework 
in addition  the cro provides regular risk assessments to executive management  the risk committee of the board  audit committee of the board  and the full board  and provides other information to executive management and the board  as requested 
our risk governance structure and processes are founded upon three lines of defense  each of which is critical to ensuring that risk and reward in all activities are properly identified  assessed  and managed 
the three lines of defense require effective teamwork combined with individual accountability within defined roles 
the first line of defense is comprised of all teammates within our lines of business  geographies  and functional areas 
the first line owns and is accountable for business strategy  performance  management  and controls within their business units and for the identification  management  and reporting of existing and emerging risks 
the second line of defense is comprised of corporate functions  including crm  with independent oversight responsibilities 
oversight includes governance  guidance  establishment of policy  and oversight of execution 
the third line of defense is comprised of the bank s assurance functions audit services and risk review  which independently test  verify  and evaluate management controls and provide risk based advice and counsel to management to help develop and maintain a risk management culture that supports business objectives 
enterprise risk governance is supported by a number of senior management risk related committees 
these committees are responsible for ensuring effective risk measurement and management within their respective areas of authority 
these committees include crc  alco  and the eapmc 
the crc is chaired by the cro and supports the cro in measuring and managing our aggregate risk profile 
alco is chaired by the chief financial officer  and provides management and oversight of market related risks  and has the responsibility to optimize those risks in relation to the profitability of the underlying businesses 
eapmc is chaired by the wholesale banking executive and provides oversight of balance sheet allocations to ensure that new asset originations and assets available for purchase in the secondary market meet our risk and business objectives 
it also oversees progress towards long term balance sheet objectives 
these management committees consist of key senior executives 
the cro is an active member of alco and eapmc 
the cro and  by extension crm  establishes sound corporate risk processes that focus on identifying  measuring  analyzing  managing  and reporting the risks that we face 
at its core  crm s objective is to deliver sophisticated risk management capabilities throughout suntrust that identify  measure  analyze  manage  and report risk at the transaction  portfolio  and corporate levels  optimize decision making  promote sound processes and regulatory compliance  maximize shareholder value  and help people and institutions prosper 
to achieve this objective  we continually refine our risk governance and management limits  policies  processes  and procedures to reflect changes in external conditions and or corporate goals and strategies 
in terms of underwriting  we seek to mitigate risk through analysis of such things as a borrower s credit history  financial statements  tax returns  cash flow projections and liquidity  and collateral value 
additionally  our loan products and underwriting elements are continuously reviewed and refined 
examples include client eligibility requirements  documentation requirements  loan types  collateral types  ltv ratios  and minimum credit scores 
prior reviews have resulted in more stringent documentation standards  lower maximum ltv ratios  and channel and client type restrictions 
these actions have contributed to material reductions in higher risk exposures  such as higher risk mortgage  home equity  and commercial construction loans since these higher risk segments have produced the majority of our net charge offs between and these actions have also contributed to a decline in early stage delinquencies and non performing loans 
organizationally  crm measures and manages risk along four dimensions credit risk  market risk including liquidity risk  operational risk  and compliance regulatory risk including legal risk and reputational risk  which can be influenced by any of the other risk disciplines 
credit risk programs are overseen by the chief wholesale credit officer and the chief retail credit officer  market risk programs are overseen by the chief market risk officer  operational risk programs are overseen by the coro  and compliance regulatory risk programs are overseen by the corporate compliance and regulatory liaison officer 
other activities overseen by crm include risk information and reporting  risk analytics  including stress testing and the alll  model risk management  asset quality credit process assurance risk review and risk administration functions 
credit risk management credit risk refers to the potential for economic loss arising from the failure of clients to meet their contractual agreements on all credit instruments  including on balance sheet exposures from loans and leases  investment securities  contingent exposures from unfunded commitments  letters of credit  credit derivatives  and counterparty risk under derivative products 
as credit risk is an essential component of many of the products and services we provide to our clients  the ability to accurately measure and manage credit risk is integral to maintain both the long run profitability of our lines of business and our capital adequacy 
crm establishes credit risk management governance frameworks and policies  and oversees adherence 
it also independently measures  analyzes  and reports on portfolio and risk trends  and actively participates in the formulation of the company s credit strategies 
credit risk officers and supporting teammates within our lines of business are direct participants in the origination  underwriting  and ongoing management of credit 
they promote an appropriate balance between our risk management and business objectives through adherence to established policies  procedures  and standards 
risk review  one of our independent assurance functions  regularly assesses and reports on business unit and enterprise asset quality  and the integrity of our credit processes 
in addition  total borrower exposure limits are established and concentration risk is monitored 
credit risk is partially mitigated through purchase of credit loss protection via third party insurance and use of credit derivatives such as cds 
borrower counterparty obligor risk and facility risk are evaluated using our risk rating methodology  which has been implemented in all lines of business 
we use various risk models in the estimation of expected and unexpected losses 
these models incorporate both internal and external default and loss experience 
to the extent possible  we collect internal data to ensure the validity  reliability  and accuracy of our risk models used in default and loss estimation 
we have made a commitment to maintain and enhance comprehensive credit systems in order to meet business requirements and comply with evolving regulatory standards 
as part of a continuous improvement process  credit risk management evaluates potential enhancements to our risk measurement and management tools  implementing them as appropriate along with amended credit policies and procedures 
operational risk management we face ongoing and emerging risks and regulations related to the activities that surround the delivery of banking and financial products 
coupled with external influences such as market conditions  fraudulent activities  disasters  security risks  country risk  and legal risk  the potential for operational and reputational loss has increased 
we believe that effective management of operational risk defined as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes  people and systems  or from external events plays a major role in both the level and the stability of the profitability of the institution 
our operational risk management function oversees an enterprise wide framework intended to identify  assess  control  monitor  and report on operational risks company wide 
these processes support our goals in seeking to minimize future operational losses and strengthen our performance by optimizing operational capital allocation 
operational risk management is overseen by our coro  who reports directly to the cro 
the operational risk governance structure also includes a risk manager and support staff embedded within each line of business and corporate function 
these risk managers are responsible for execution of risk management within their areas in compliance with crm s policies and procedures 
market risk management market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  equity prices  commodity prices  and other relevant market rates or prices 
interest rate risk  defined as the exposure of net interest income and mve to adverse movements in interest rates  is our primary market risk and mainly arises from the structure of the balance sheet  which includes all loans 
variable rate loans  prior to any hedging related actions  are approximately of total loans and after giving consideration to hedging related actions  are approximately of total loans 
we are also exposed to market risk in our trading instruments carried at fair value 
alco meets regularly and is responsible for reviewing our open positions and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to market risk 
the policies established by alco are reviewed and approved by our board 
market risk from non trading activities the primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk  both within policy limits approved by the board and within narrower guidelines established by alco 
these limits and guidelines reflect our tolerance for interest rate risk over both short term and long term horizons 
the major sources of our non trading interest rate risk are timing differences in the maturity and repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities  changes in the shape of the yield curve  and the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options 
we measure these risks and their impact by identifying and quantifying exposures through the use of sophisticated simulation and valuation models 
one of the primary methods that we use to quantify and manage interest rate risk is simulation analysis  which is used to model net interest income from assets  liabilities  and derivative positions under various interest rate scenarios and balance sheet structures 
this analysis measures the sensitivity of net interest income over a two year time horizon 
key assumptions in the simulation analysis and in the valuation analysis discussed below relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads  the changes in product balances and the behavior of loan and deposit clients in different rate environments 
this analysis incorporates several assumptions  the most material of which relate to the repricing characteristics and balance fluctuations of deposits with indeterminate or non contractual maturities 
as the future path of interest rates cannot be known in advance  we use simulation analysis to project net interest income under various interest rate scenarios including implied forward and deliberately extreme and perhaps unlikely scenarios 
the analyses may include rapid and gradual ramping of interest rates  rate shocks  basis risk analysis  and yield curve twists 
each analysis incorporates what management believes to be the most appropriate assumptions about client behavior in an interest rate scenario 
specific strategies are also analyzed to determine their impact on net interest income levels and sensitivities 
the sensitivity analysis included below is measured as a percentage change in net interest income due to an instantaneous basis point move in benchmark interest rates 
estimated changes set forth below are dependent upon material assumptions such as those previously discussed 
the net interest income profile reflects a relatively neutral interest rate sensitive position with respect to an instantaneous basis point change in rates 
interest rate sensitivity from an economic perspective table estimated change in net interest income over months basis points december  december  rate change given the inherent limitations of certain of these measurement tools and techniques  results become less meaningful as interest rates approach zero 
the recognition of interest rate sensitivity from an economic perspective above is different from a financial reporting perspective below due to certain interest rate swaps that are used as economic hedges for fixed rate debt 
the above profile includes the recognition of the net interest payments from these swaps  while the profile below does not include the net interest payments 
the swaps are accounted for as trading assets and therefore  the benefit to income due to a decline in short term interest rates will be recognized as a gain in the fair value of the swaps and will be recorded as an increase in trading income loss from a financial reporting perspective 
interest rate sensitivity from a financial reporting perspective table estimated change in net interest income over months basis points december  december  rate change given the inherent limitations of certain of these measurement tools and techniques  results become less meaningful as interest rates approach zero 
the slight difference from december  to december  seen above in both the economic and financial reporting perspectives related to the basis point shock scenario is primarily due to a slight increase in asset sensitivity from projected balance sheet growth of floating rate assets funded with low cost deposits 
we also perform valuation analysis  which is used for discerning levels of risk present in the balance sheet and derivative positions that might not be taken into account in the net interest income simulation analysis above 
whereas net interest income simulation highlights exposures over a relatively short time horizon  valuation analysis incorporates all cash flows over the estimated remaining life of all balance sheet and derivative positions 
the valuation of the balance sheet  at a point in time  is defined as the discounted present value of asset cash flows and derivative cash flows minus the discounted present value of liability cash flows  the net of which is referred to as mve 
the sensitivity of mve to changes in the level of interest rates is a measure of the longer term repricing risk and options risk embedded in the balance sheet 
similar to the net interest income simulation  mve uses instantaneous changes in rates 
mve values only the current balance sheet and does not incorporate the growth assumptions that are used in the net interest income simulation model 
as with the net interest income simulation model  assumptions about the timing and variability of balance sheet cash flows are critical in the mve analysis 
particularly important are the assumptions driving prepayments and the expected changes in balances and pricing of the indeterminate deposit portfolios 
as of december   the mve profile indicates changes with respect to an instantaneous basis point change in rates 
mve sensitivity is reported in both upward and downward rate shocks 
however  results at december  in the downward rate shock is significantly less meaningful than the upward rate shock 
in a shock scenario  current interest rate levels that are already at or near are adversely impacting discounted cash flow analysis causing the short end of the discount curve to be zero bound and therefore  the shock behaves more like a curve flattener than a parallel shock 
market value of equity sensitivity table estimated change in mve basis points december  december  rate change given the inherent limitations of certain of these measurement tools and techniques  results become less meaningful as interest rates approach zero 
while an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates is used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under an extremely adverse scenario  we believe that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a much more modest impact 
since mve measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments  the change in mve does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon ie  the current fiscal year 
further  mve does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth  changes in product mix  changes in yield curve relationships  and changing product spreads that could mitigate the adverse impact of changes in interest rates 
the net interest income simulation and valuation analyses do not include actions that management may undertake to manage this risk in response to anticipated changes in interest rates 
market risk from trading activities under established policies and procedures  we manage market risk associated with trading  capital markets  and foreign exchange activities using a var approach that determines total exposure arising from interest rate risk  equity risk  foreign exchange risk  spread risk  and volatility risk 
for trading portfolios  var measures the estimated maximum loss from a trading position  given a specified confidence level and time horizon 
var exposures and actual results are monitored daily for each trading portfolio 
our var calculation measures the potential losses using a confidence level with a one day holding period 
this means that  on average  losses are expected to exceed var two or three times per year 
we had no backtest exceptions to our overall var for the years ended december  and the following table presents high  low  and average var for the years ended december  and value at risk profile table year ended december dollars in millions average var high var low var average var during the year ended december  was lower compared to the year ended december  primarily due to sales  paydowns  and maturities of illiquid trading assets 
this is a result of continuing to manage down illiquid asset holdings where possible  as they are not part of our core business activities 
while var can be a useful risk management tool  it does have inherent limitations including the assumption that past market behavior is indicative of future market performance 
as such  var is only one of several tools used to manage trading risk 
specifically  scenario analysis  stress testing  profit and loss attribution  and stop loss limits are among other tools also used to actively manage trading risk 
trading assets  net of trading liabilities  averaged billion and billion for the years ended december  and  respectively 
trading assets  net of trading liabilities  were billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
the increase in average and as of trading balances was primarily a result of an increase in the trs portfolio and growth in fixed income trading  but partially offset by reductions in illiquid trading asset holdings 
liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk of being unable to meet obligations as they come due at a reasonable funding cost 
we mitigate this risk by structuring our balance sheet prudently and by maintaining diverse borrowing resources to fund potential cash needs 
for example  we structure our balance sheet so that we fund less liquid assets  such as loans  with stable funding sources  such as retail and wholesale deposits  long term debt  and capital 
we primarily monitor and manage liquidity risk at the parent company and bank levels as the non bank subsidiaries are relatively small and these subsidiaries ultimately rely upon the parent company as a source of liquidity in adverse environments 
the bank s primary liquid assets consist of excess reserves and free and liquid securities in its investment portfolio 
the bank manages its investment portfolio primarily as a source of liquidity  maintaining the strong majority of its securities in liquid and high grade asset classes such as agency mbs  agency debt  and us treasury securities 
as of december   the bank s afs investment portfolio contained billion of free and liquid securities at book value  of which approximately consisted of agency mbs  agency debt  and us treasury securities 
some fair value assets are pledged for corporate borrowings or other liquidity purposes 
most of these arrangements provide for advances to be made based on the market value and not the principal balance of the assets  and therefore  whether or not we have elected fair value accounting treatment does not impact our liquidity 
if the fair value of assets posted as collateral declines  we will be required to post more collateral under our borrowing arrangements which could negatively impact our liquidity position on an overall basis 
for purposes of computing regulatory capital  mark to market adjustments related to our own creditworthiness for debt and index linked cds  accounted for at fair value  are excluded from regulatory capital 
we manage the parent company to maintain most of its liquid assets in cash and securities that could be quickly converted to cash 
unlike the bank  it is not typical for the parent company to maintain a portfolio of publicly traded securities 
however  prior to retiring the preferred stock issued to the us treasury in march  the parent company invested approximately billion of cash in a portfolio of us treasury securities 
we manage the parent company cash balance to provide sufficient liquidity to fund all forecasted obligations primarily debt and capital related for an extended period of months in accordance with company risk limits 
we assess liquidity needs that may occur in both the normal course of business and times of unusual events  considering both on and off balance sheet arrangements and commitments that may impact liquidity in certain business environments 
we have contingency funding plans that assess liquidity needs that may arise from certain stress events such as credit rating downgrades  severe economic recessions  and financial market disruptions 
our contingency plans also provide for continuous monitoring of net borrowed funds dependence and available sources of contingent liquidity 
these sources of contingent liquidity include available cash reserves  the ability to sell  pledge  or borrow against unencumbered securities in the bank s investment portfolio  capacity to borrow from the fhlb system  and the capacity to borrow at the federal reserve discount window 
the table below presents period end and average balances from these four sources as of and for the year ended december  and we believe these contingent liquidity sources exceed any contingent liquidity needs 
contingent liquidity sources table december  december  dollars in billions as of average for the year ended as of average for the year ended excess reserves free and liquid investment portfolio securities fhlb borrowing capacity discount window borrowing capacity total average based upon month end data  except excess reserves  which is based upon a daily average 
uses of funds 
our primary uses of funds include the extension of loans and credit  the purchase of investment securities  working capital  and debt and capital service 
the bank and the parent company borrow in the money markets using instruments such as fed funds  eurodollars  and cp 
as of december   the parent company had no cp outstanding and the bank retained a material cash position in the form of excess reserves in its federal reserve account 
in the absence of robust loan demand  we have chosen to deploy some of this excess liquidity to purchase and retire certain high cost debt securities or other borrowings 
during the year ended december   pursuant to a capital plan submitted to the federal reserve  we repurchased high cost tier capital securities  including certain trust preferred securities and billion of our series c and series d fixed rate cumulative preferred stock issued to the us treasury under the tarp s cpp 
despite these transactions  the parent company retains a material cash position  in accordance with company policies and risk limits discussed in greater detail below 
additionally  contingent uses of funds may arise from events such as financial market disruptions or credit rating downgrades 
factors that affect our credit ratings include  but are not limited to  the credit risk profile of our assets  the adequacy of our alll  the level and stability of our earnings  the liquidity profile of both the bank and the parent company  the economic environment  and the adequacy of our capital base 
as of december   moody s  s p  and dbrs all maintained a stable outlook on our credit ratings  while fitch maintained a positive outlook  citing improved credit and earnings trends 
future credit rating downgrades are possible  although not currently anticipated given the stable and positive credit rating outlooks 
debt credit ratings and outlook table as of december  moody s s p fitch dbrs suntrust banks  inc short term p a f r low senior long term baa bbb bbb a low suntrust bank short term p a f r low senior long term a bbb bbb a outlook stable stable positive stable sources of funds 
our primary source of funds is a large  stable retail deposit base 
core deposits  predominantly made up of consumer and commercial deposits  are primarily gathered from our retail branch network and are our largest  most cost effective source of funding 
core deposits increased to billion as of december   from billion as of december  we also maintain access to a diversified collection of both secured and unsecured wholesale funding sources 
these uncommitted sources include fed funds purchased from other banks  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  negotiable cds  offshore deposits  fhlb advances  global bank notes  and cp 
aggregate wholesale funding decreased to billion as of december   from billion as of december  approximately billion of wholesale debt matured during the year ended december  and was redeemed at par 
net short term unsecured borrowings  which includes wholesale domestic and foreign deposits and fed funds purchased  decreased to billion as of december   from billion as of december  as mentioned above  the bank and parent company maintain programs to access the debt capital markets 
the parent company maintains an sec shelf registration statement from which it may issue senior or subordinated notes and various capital securities such as common or preferred stock 
our board has authorized the issuance of up to billion of such securities  of which approximately billion of issuance capacity remains available 
the most recent issuance from this shelf occurred on october   when we issued million of senior parent company notes due january  the bank also maintains a global bank note program under which it may issue senior or subordinated debt with various terms 
as of december   the bank had billion of remaining board authority to issue notes under the program 
our issuance capacity under these programs refers to authorization granted by our board and does not refer to a commitment to purchase by any investor 
debt and equity securities issued under these programs are designed to appeal primarily to domestic and international institutional investors 
institutional investor demand for these securities is dependent upon numerous factors  including but not limited to our credit ratings and investor perception of financial market conditions and the health of the banking sector 
parent company liquidity 
our primary measure of parent company liquidity is the length of time the parent company can meet its existing and certain forecasted obligations using its present balance of cash and liquid securities without the support of dividends from the bank or new debt issuance 
in accordance with risk limits established by alco and the board  we manage the parent company s liquidity by structuring its maturity schedule to minimize the amount of debt maturing within a short period of time 
during the year ended december   we had no parent company debt that matured  and approximately billion of parent company debt is scheduled to mature in also during  we repurchased million of parent company junior subordinated notes that were due in a majority of the parent company s liabilities are long term in nature  coming from the proceeds of our capital securities and long term senior and subordinated notes 
the primary uses of parent company liquidity include debt service  dividends on capital instruments  the periodic purchase of investment securities  and loans to our subsidiaries 
we fund corporate dividends primarily with dividends from our banking subsidiary 
we are subject to both state and federal banking regulations that limit our ability to pay common stock dividends in certain circumstances 
recent developments 
numerous legislative and regulatory proposals currently outstanding may have an effect on our liquidity if they become effective  the potential impact of which cannot be presently quantified 
however  we believe that we will be well positioned to comply with new standards as they become effective as a result of our strong core banking franchise and liquidity management practices 
see discussion of certain current legislative and regulatory proposals within the executive overview section of this md a 
on december   the federal reserve published proposed measures to strengthen regulation and supervision of large bank holding companies and systemically important nonbank financial firms  pursuant to sections and of the dodd frank act 
these proposed regulations include a number of requirements related to liquidity that would be instituted in phases 
the first phase encompasses largely qualitative liquidity risk management practices  including internal liquidity stress testing 
the second phase would include certain quantitative liquidity requirements related to the proposed basel iii liquidity standards 
we believe that the company is well positioned to demonstrate compliance with these new requirements and standards if and when they are adopted 
other liquidity considerations 
as presented in table  we had an aggregate potential obligation of billion to our clients in unused lines of credit at december  commitments to extend credit are arrangements to lend to clients who have complied with predetermined contractual obligations 
we also had billion in letters of credit as of december   most of which are standby letters of credit  which require that we provide funding if certain future events occur 
approximately billion of these letters as of december  supported variable rate demand obligations 
as of december   our liability for utbs was million 
the liability for interest related to these utbs was million as of december  the utbs represent the difference between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns and the benefits recognized and measured in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance for income taxes 
the utbs are based on various tax positions in several jurisdictions  and if taxes related to these positions are ultimately paid  the payments would be made from our normal operating cash flows  likely over multiple years 
unfunded lending commitments table dollars in millions december  december  unused lines of credit commercial mortgage commitments home equity lines commercial real estate cp conduit credit card total unused lines of credit letters of credit financial standby performance standby commercial total letters of credit includes irlc contracts with notional balances of billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
other market risk other sources of market risk include the risk associated with holding residential and commercial mortgage loans prior to selling them into the secondary market  commitments to clients to make mortgage loans that will be sold to the secondary market  and our investment in msrs 
we manage the risks associated with the residential and commercial mortgage loans classified as held for sale ie  the warehouse and our irlcs on residential loans intended for sale 
the warehouses and irlcs consist primarily of fixed and adjustable rate single family residential and commercial real estate 
the risk associated with the warehouses and irlcs is the potential change in interest rates between the time the customer locks in the rate on the anticipated loan and the time the loan is sold on the secondary market  which is typically days 
we manage interest rate risk predominantly with interest rate swaps  futures  and forward sale agreements  where the changes in value of the instruments substantially offset the changes in value of the warehouse and the irlcs 
the irlcs on residential mortgage loans intended for sale are classified as free standing derivative financial instruments and are not designated as hedge accounting relationships 
msrs are the present value of future net cash flows that are expected to be received from the mortgage servicing portfolio 
the value of msrs is highly dependent upon the assumed prepayment speed of the mortgage servicing portfolio which is driven by the level of certain key interest rates  primarily the year current coupon par mortgage rate 
future expected net cash flows from servicing a loan in the mortgage servicing portfolio would not be realized if the loan pays off earlier than anticipated 
the average prepayment speed for remained relatively unchanged compared with there was a slight increase in prepayments toward the end of the year as mortgage interest rates declined 
msrs  which are carried at fair value  totaled million and billion as of december  and  respectively  are managed within established risk limits and are monitored as part of various governance processes 
we recorded decreases of million and million in the fair value of our msrs for the years ended december  and  respectively 
increases or decreases in fair value include the decay resulting from the realization of expected monthly net servicing cash flows 
for the years ended december  and  we originated msrs with fair values at the time of origination of million and million  respectively 
new originations during more than offset the decrease in msr value attributed to decay 
an all time low in mortgage rates accounted for the majority of the decline in fair value of our msrs during also contributing million to the decline in the fair value of msrs was an increase in prepayment assumptions attributable to anticipated refinancing activity from the harp program 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded losses related to msrs of million and million including decay of million and million  respectively  inclusive of the mark to market adjustments on the related hedges 
we continue to evaluate the impact that the consent order may have  and we currently do not expect the impact to be material unless third party price indications reflect lower market valuations 
recent changes to the us government s making homes affordable program will likely increase the number of borrowers that are eligible for mortgage refinance opportunities 
we expect that prepayment rates for a portion of the loans in our servicing portfolio will increase and result in a decline in the value of our msr asset in future quarters 
program terms  such as seller representations and warranties  will influence the impact on prepayment rates and those details have yet to be published 
see the noninterest income section of this md a and note goodwill and other intangible assets  to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for further discussion of msr valuation sensitivities 
we also have market risk from capital stock we hold in the fhlb of atlanta and from capital stock we hold in the federal reserve bank 
in order to be an fhlb member  we are required to purchase capital stock in the fhlb 
in exchange  members take advantage of competitively priced advances as a wholesale funding source and access grants and low cost loans for affordable housing and community development projects  amongst other benefits 
as of december   we held a total of million of capital stock in the fhlb 
during  we increased our capital stock holding in the fhlb by million 
in order to become a member of the federal reserve system  regulations require that we hold a certain amount of capital stock as either a percentage of the bank s capital or as a percentage of total deposit liabilities 
as of december   we held million of federal reserve bank stock 
during  we added million to our position 
for a detailed overview regarding actions taken to address the risk from changes in equity prices associated with our investment in coke common stock  see investment in common shares of the coca cola company  in this md a 
we also hold  as of december   a total net book value of approximately million of private equity investments that predominantly include direct investments and limited partnerships 
we hold these investments as long term investments and make additional contributions based on our contractual commitments but have decided to limit investments into new private equity investments 
impairment charges could occur if deteriorating conditions in the market persist  including  but not limited to  goodwill and other intangibles impairment charges and increased charges with respect to oreo 
we also have risk related to holdings of foreign debt  securities  and commitments to lend to foreign countries and corporations  both funded and unfunded 
specifically  the risk is higher for exposure to countries that are experiencing significant economic  fiscal  and or political strains 
at december   we identified five countries in europe that we believe are experiencing strains such that the likelihood of default is higher than would be anticipated if current economic  fiscal  and political strains were not present 
the countries we identified were greece  ireland  italy  portugal  and spain  and were chosen based on the economic situation experienced in these countries during and continuing to exist as of december  at december   we had no outstanding exposure to sovereign debt of these countries 
although  at december   we had direct exposure to corporations and individuals in these countries of million  that comprised securities held  unfunded commitments to lend  and a nominal amount of funded loans 
indirect exposure to these countries was million at december  and consisted primarily of double default risk exposure 
the majority of the exposure is the notional amount of letters of credit issued on behalf of our role as an agent bank under the terms of a syndicated corporate loan agreement  wherein other participant banks in the syndicate are located in the identified higher risk countries 
overall  gross exposure to these countries is less than of our total assets as of december  off balance sheet arrangements see discussion of off balance sheet arrangements in note  certain transfers of financial assets and variable interest entities  and note  reinsurance arrangements and guarantees  to the consolidated financial statements in this form k
