item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements for the years ended december   and and related notes included elsewhere in this document 
overview we provide secure information exchange capabilities for consumers and enterprise through the development and distribution of software  delivery of managed and hosted solutions  and provision of associated services 
since our organization in  we have evolved from a company focused primarily on personal file transfer products  sold over the internet  to a solution provider deriving over percent of revenue from sales to small and medium business  or smb  and enterprise customers worldwide 
today  we have thousands of enterprise customers and more than one million individual consumers in over countries 
in addition  our solutions are used by more than  us army users deployed worldwide 
historically  we have operated primarily in the managed file transfer  or mft  industry  with the majority of our revenue derived from sales of on premises software licenses and associated maintenance and support contracts 
beginning in  we began an evolution from an mft company into adjacent solution spaces applicable to what we refer to as total path security 
the total path security framework addresses data and information security in motion for example  with traditional mft solutions delivered as on premises software or as a cloud service and at rest for example  with endpoint security solutions such as appshield 
our solution portfolio facilitates delivery of critical information such as financial data  medical records  customer files and other similar documents while supporting a range of information protection approaches to meet privacy and other security requirements 
most recently  in december  we announced the acquisition of tappin  inc or tappin 
tappin provides technology that allows users to access their digital files and media such as pictures  
table of contents documents  videos and music stored on a computer using a web browser  tablet or mobile smartphone including apple iphone and ipad  google android and windows phone without having to upload  organize and sync files between devices or pay for additional cloud storage 
we also continue to plan for our entry into the antivirus segment of the endpoint security market through development of appshield  a software application control or whitelisting product 
our evolution from an mft company into adjacent solution spaces reflects ongoing  fundamental changes in how consumers and businesses access and exchange information 
for example  there has been an exponential increase in internet enabled mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers 
this  in turn  has driven a movement toward bring your own device or byod  an operating model in which business users increasingly are using their mobile devices to access and exchange employer information while also using those same devices for personal applications 
the continued growth of cloud based services is another fundamental market driver  as individual consumers and businesses become increasingly comfortable with these services for at least some personal and business applications 
as we consider key market drivers in aggregate  we believe there is a current and growing market opportunity for providing on premises  cloud based  and mobile access to personal and business information while addressing the security and compliance issues that are important considerations for our customers as they access and exchange such information 
while on premises solutions will remain an important part of our portfolio for the foreseeable future  we believe increasing demand for secure content mobility and adoption of cloud based solutions are long term trends that increasingly will shape the market outlook and demand for our solutions 
key business metrics we have structured our business model to sell an appropriate mix of software licenses for on premises use  maintenance and support m s  cloud based subscription solutions  and professional services 
we review a number of key business metrics on an ongoing basis to help us monitor our performance and to identify material trends which may affect our business 
the measures that we believe are the primary indicators of our performance are revenue growth  recurring revenue growth  aggregate contract value  and ebitda 
we have developed an internal management dashboard that summarizes certain business metrics and also supports drill down analyses of some sales  marketing  and support activities that also provide indicators of our business performance 
revenue growth since  we have transitioned from a consumer products company mostly focused on cuteftp to an enterprise solutions provider with growing revenue contribution from cloud based solutions and professional services 
we have grown revenue consistently throughout this transition  even as revenue from our consumer products declined from more than percent of revenue as recently as to less than percent today 
we believe our ability to sustain revenue growth while continuing our business transformation is the most significant metric for our business 

table of contents although we often have grown revenue sequentially  quarter over quarter  in recent years we view annual revenue growth as the more important metric  especially considering the ongoing evolution of our solution portfolio 
we believe annual core revenue growth  excluding very large  exceptional deals  is a key metric for monitoring our continued success in developing our business in future periods 
given our diverse solution portfolio  and especially with the addition of subscription services  we review our revenue mix and changes in revenue  across all solutions  on a regular basis to identify key trends and adjust resource allocations 
our annual revenue increased by in  a slight increase over the increase realized in we believe this increase in revenue growth rate  though modest  is significant because it occurred as we continued to add additional subscription revenue and build aggregate contract value 
we believe our annual revenue growth rate could have been higher in  had we focused only on sales of on premises software licenses which would have had a more immediate positive impact on our revenue  but at the expense of revenue growth in future periods 
in addition  we believe there is a clear market trend toward increasing adoption of cloud based solutions and we believe establishing traction in this market segment is a significant factor in our continued ability to grow revenue in future years 
recurring revenue growth recurring revenue includes revenue recognized from our m s contracts  managed and hosted solutions  and other subscription services such as tappin by globalscape 
maintenance and support contracts for our products are sold for fixed periods of time and are typically for one year  although some agreements are for longer terms 
we recognize revenue from these agreements on a monthly basis over the life of the contract 
managed and hosted solutions  such as mix and hosted eft server  are sold as one  two  or three year subscriptions  with the services invoiced and recognized on a monthly basis 
tappin subscriptions typically are sold for one year terms  with the revenue also recognized on a monthly basis 
recurring revenue provides a more predictable revenue stream in future periods and  we believe  is more highly valued by institutional investors and other market participants 
we review recurring revenue trends periodically to determine the progress of our m s and cloud solution sales  and customer satisfaction with our ongoing solution development and support activities 
we also assess how aggregate contract value see below will factor into possible recurring revenue in future periods 
we have grown recurring revenue in recent years from percent in  to percent in and percent in we believe the level of deferred revenue is an important indicator of our success in satisfying and retaining existing customers  as well as in establishing longer term relationships with new customers 
if we do not deliver the support needed by end users of our products  then they may not renew their maintenance and support agreements 
if end users stop using our products  they also typically will not renew their maintenance and support agreements 
similarly  if customers are not satisfied with our delivery of managed solutions  they may terminate their subscriptions  adversely impacting future recurring revenue 
an increase in deferred revenues thus indicates growth in our installed base and satisfaction with our products  maintenance and support services  and managed solutions 
we expect deferred revenue to continue to grow in both in absolute terms and as a percentage of total revenue 
aggregate contract value growth aggregate contract value or acv is the sum of deferred revenue carried on the balance sheet eg  from maintenance and support and professional services  plus subscription services  remaining mat contract payments  and any other non cancellable contracted sales that have not yet been recognized into revenue or carried on the balance sheet as deferred revenue 
our acv results from sales of certain managed solutions and professional services 
specifically  managed solutions contribute to acv when they are sold and subsequently invoiced on a monthly basis rather than 
table of contents invoiced in their entirety in advance 
the mclane advanced technologies professional services contract also contributes to acv because we submit invoices to the customer monthly  as the services are delivered and recognizable into revenue 
we have grown acv from million as of december  consisting only of our deferred revenue balance to approximately million as of december  we expect acv may grow in future periods as we increase sales and renewals of maintenance and support contracts and sales of managed solutions and possibly receive additional long term professional services contracts or the customer exercises the last option year on the mat contract 
acv is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap and should not be considered a substitute for deferred revenue  however  management uses this metric to assess the effectiveness of sales and business development activities  and how that effectiveness will factor into future revenue 
we have maintained increased visibility into acv in recent years because  with the addition of subscription services and increased sales of professional services  we believe sales growth may significantly outpace revenue growth in the near term 
acv  together with recurring revenue and deferred revenue trends  provides greater insight into how bookings will factor into revenue over specific periods 
the following is a reconciliation of acv to deferred revenue at december  in thousands december  deferred revenue subscription services mat contract payments other non cancellable contracted sales not recognized as revenue or recorded as deferred revenue total acv adjusted ebitda management utilizes adjusted ebitda or earnings before interest  taxes  total other income expense  depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation expense to monitor spending and profitability of the company 
we monitor and review selling  general  and administrative sg a and r d expenses to assess conformance with established budget expectations and identify specific variances 
identifying and  if necessary  addressing variances above budget is important for the very clear purpose of staying within budget ceilings 
however  even variances below budget may indicate imbalances in resource allocations or deviation of operating activities from established expectations 
we have increased sg a expenses in recent years  primarily to enhance our executive team and make other investments necessary to grow our business 
similarly  we have sustained our r d investments to provide a continuing basis for specifying and developing new solutions like our recently announced cloud based offerings and appshield 

table of contents adjusted ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap and should not be considered a substitute for net income 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income  plus income taxes  total other income expense  depreciation and amortization  and stock based compensation expense 
adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool  and when assessing our operating performance  adjusted ebitda should not considered in isolation  or as a substitute for net income or other income statement data prepared in accordance with gaap 
the following is a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income for the periods indicated 
year ended december  december  december  in thousands net revenue income from operations net income plus income taxes plus total other income expense plus depreciation and amortization plus stock based compensation expense adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda in was adversely impacted by approximately  in non recurring  charges related to the acquisition of tappin 
we also had a significant income tax credit in as reflected in the table above 
generally  we expect adjusted ebitda to increase back to our recent historical norms or even increase  as a percentage of revenue  in future years after a potential transition period due to the impact of the tappin acquisition 
solution perspective and trends the following is a summary description of our solutions and associated business trends managed file transfer solutions on premises and cloud based our mft solutions allow customers to move large files even multi terabyte in size and large numbers of files securely 
we also facilitate management  monitoring  and reporting on the file transfers and deliver advanced workflow capabilities to move data and information into and throughout an enterprise 
the cuteftp product is the best known of our file transfer solutions 
cuteftp is a client side software application that permits users to upload and download files  to or from an ftp server or host computer  with support for various file transfer and security protocols such as ftp  ssl  and ssh  plus open pgp encryption 
while cuteftp still has significant brand recognition in the market  it currently accounts for approximately percent of our revenue  down from almost percent as recently as we believe subsequent market availability of free ftp utilities plus the emergence of social media and proliferation of means for sharing non sensitive data such as photos and videos  for example  are the proximate cause of the decline in cuteftp revenue 
however  we are planning to release a major upgrade of cuteftp in and believe this potentially may slow the rate of decrease in cuteftp revenue in the second half of and into we derive most  approximately percent  of our revenue from software license sales of our enhanced file transfer server solution suite 
the enhanced file transfer server solution suite provides a common  scalable mft platform that accommodates a broad family of add on modules to provide smb and enterprise customers 
table of contents with increased security  automation  and performance when compared to traditional ftp based and e mail delivery systems 
the add on modules allow customers to select the solution configuration most applicable to their requirements for auditing and reporting  encryption  ad hoc and web based file transfers  operability in or through a dmz network  and integration with back end business processes  including workflow automation capabilities 
we continue to develop the enhanced file transfer solution suite  for example to increase performance  provide additional administration flexibility  and support cross platform implementation with our dmz gateway solution 
revenue for this product line has grown on a sustained basis in recent years from approximately million per year in to approximately million in since  we have executed a partner agreement with rackspace hosting that allows us to deliver cloud based mft solutions for the secure exchange of business to business bb data  including large files and sensitive data 
we also established additional hosting partner arrangements in that extended our cloud based delivery services to include additional capacity in the united kingdom and canada 
our cloud based solutions allow customers to outsource all or part of their complex and demanding information exchange needs to reduce costs  improve operational efficiencies  track and audit transactions  and provide a greater level of security 
the cloud based solutions established an additional delivery method for enhanced file transfer server capabilities  and potentially for other solution capabilities 
through our cloud services  we can offer new and existing customers pay as you go  flexible pricing under one  two  and three year contracts that help them eliminate upfront capital expenditures 
this subscription revenue provides us with a growing revenue stream visible into future periods 
wide area file services and continuous data protection solution we obtained the original technology used in our wide area file services and continuous data protection software through the acquisition of availl  inc in together  wafs and cdp allow users to synchronize files among distributed teams  sending only the changed data  quickly and transparently to end user users  with continuous real time backup 
this approach ensures currency of data at each supported site and also significantly reduces bandwidth usage compared to traditional information sharing process that support collaboration across multiple locations 
through the timeframe  we devoted considerable attention to improving the performance and overall quality of the wafs solution after the availl acquisition 
sales of the wafs cdp family of solutions contributed approximately percent of our revenue in and  but declined to approximately percent of total revenue in  while also declining in absolute terms from approximately million in to million in we released wafs  a major upgrade of the solution  in september wafs introduced a new user interface  support for unicode characters to facilitate greater international sales  and other significant enhancements 
however  some customers experienced difficulties during their upgrades  slowing wafs adoption and sales traction for this solution 
we have responded to these difficulties with additional solution enhancements and support process enhancements that will support a return to historical sales levels for wafs 
managed e mail attachment solution our managed e mail attachment solution  mail express  is a client server application that allows users to send and receive e mail attachments  up to gb  with enhanced security and visibility compared to typical e mail solutions 
the mail express application also provides flexible  customer defined administration privileges to allow e mail administrators and even end users to configure specific parameters for handling e mail attachments in accordance with corporate policy 

table of contents we initially launched the mail express solution in december and have continued to make enhancements  including releasing mail express in august market adoption of mail express initially was slower than expected  but began to increase in with the mail express release 
mail express sales continued to increase in going forward  we believe we have developed  and are maintaining  a competitive long term solution for securely sharing and managing even very large e mail attachments 
secure content mobility solution our tappin by globalscape service  acquired in december  allows users to access and securely share all files stored on an office or home computer from any web browser and all popular mobile devices  including apple iphone and ipad  google android and windows phone 
tappin provides an easy  secure method to access and share documents  photos  videos  and music across multiple devices  regardless of time or location 
the service is differentiated from typical cloud based repositories like dropbox or box because there is no requirement to move content from native storage into the cloud 
directly accessing content in situ provides substantial benefits including increased security  avoidance of cloud content storage costs  and ease of operation because there is no need to determine which subset of content to push into a cloud service for subsequent access 
the tappin service is delivered through direct and indirect sales 
direct sales include internet sales made through an online cart and tappin subscriptions included in bundled offerings like the secure mobile access module for eft server  announced in february indirect sales include those potentially made through original equipment manufacturing oem relationships in which the tappin service may be integrated with third party hardware or software 
tappin expects to deliver an enhanced  professional edition of the service in the second half of we expect the professional edition will have greater appeal to business users and potential oem partners 
we believe secure content mobility is a rapidly emerging central feature of our served markets  including our primary mft market 
exponential growth in smartphones and tablets  combined with rapid growth in retained content and bring your own device expectations  will drive strong growth in this market segment 
the tappin acquisition provides the company with an initial capability in the secure content mobility market  we expect to grow this component of our revenue at a rate faster than our legacy revenue growth through the next several years 
endpoint security solution we continue to plan for entry into the consumer antivirus segment of the endpoint security market with our appshield solution 
the appshield solution uses application whitelisting technology to block execution of malicious software with much greater effectiveness than traditional antivirus software 
the traditional approach to antivirus software operation is to develop specific signatures for malware  detect the presence of files matching those defined signatures  and then block or quarantine the assessed malware 
application whitelisting inverts the traditional approach by allowing the end user or an administrator to explicitly designate which software applications will be allowed to run 
the resulting whitelist then governs software execution privileges 
if an executable is not on the whitelist  it will not run 
there is growing market awareness that traditional antivirus solutions cannot keep pace with the proliferation of malware threats which are increasing significantly in sophistication and exponentially in number 
according to recent industry analyses  traditional antivirus software continues to be only to percent effective and also can have substantial adverse performance impacts on the host system 
therefore  we believe application control in the form of whitelisting has the potential to take increasing market share from traditional antivirus software in future years 
our appshield solution is the result of a joint development agreement established with coretrace corporation in december coretrace develops and markets an enterprise software application control 
table of contents solution  known as bouncer  that has been adopted by numerous businesses and agencies in the commercial and government sectors 
we have designed and are implementing an easy to use interface that integrates with coretrace s enterprise whitelisting technology to deliver this innovative application control solution to the consumer market 
delivery of appshield has been considerably delayed from original expectations 
the delays have been the result of software integration and workflow challenges associated with building on coretrace s bouncer enterprise whitelisting solution to produce a product appropriate for consumer adoption and other market applications 
we currently plan on introducing appshield to market later in professional services professional services have represented an increasing part of our business in recent years  growing from thousand  or less than one percent of revenue  in to million or of revenue in we have made a concerted effort to increase our professional services revenue in the commercial and government market sectors as part of our corporate evolution as an enterprise solution provider 
from a commercial perspective  we continue to bundle packaged or relatively tightly prescribed and custom services with many of our enterprise and smb software sales 
within the government market  we continue to retain several full time engineers on a mclane advanced technologies mat industry team that won a large us army order during these professional services engagements allow us to better ensure successful solution implementation and also provide us with increased visibility into ongoing customer requirements 
our increase in delivery of these services also brings us into closer alignment with expected typical professional services contributions to enterprise sales opportunities 
while we have increased our professional services delivery in each of the last three years  from through  total professional services revenue is dependent  to a significant extent  on the mat contract option year which may  or may not  be executed for government fiscal year our increased professional services lead to a corresponding increase in our cost of revenues or cost of goods sold  because the services necessarily are labor intensive 
for this reason  professional services typically have significantly lower margins than product sales or subscription services 
however  we believe professional services allow us to better establish and maintain our solution implementations  while also providing our customers with the training and education services that help them make more complete use of our solution capabilities 
in addition  for large contracts like the engineering services provided to the army  such professional services provide significant past performance that facilitates additional business 
over time  we believe the return on investment from increased professional services outweighs the potential near term impacts on operating margins 
liquidity and capital resources the company has a strong working capital position resulting from net profits from operations over of the last quarters 
at december   our net working capital position was approximately million 
we had cash available of million and we continue to generate cash from operating activities 
we rely on cash on hand and cash flows from operations to fund our operations and believe that these will be our principal sources of operating capital in our capital requirements principally relate to our need to enhance our existing products and to develop new products  which primarily consist of research and development expenses and expenses for people and the elements that support their work 
in  we enhanced our product offerings through the acquisition of tappin  a secure mobile file transfer technology company 
this acquisition was funded by million in cash and million in borrowings under a new five year term loan 
under the terms of the merger agreement with tappin  the former stockholders of tappin could be paid an additional million upon achieving certain revenue milestones and delivery of a new edition of the acquired technology milestone 

table of contents because our principal sources of capital are cash on hand and cash flow from operations  to the extent that sales decline  our cash flow from operations will also decline 
if sales decline or if our liquidity is otherwise under duress  management could substantially reduce personnel and personnel related costs  reduce or substantially eliminate capital expenditures and or reduce or substantially eliminate research and development expenditures 
we may also sell equity or debt securities or enter into credit arrangements in order to finance future acquisitions or licensing activities  to the extent available 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in was primarily due to the net impact of increases in accounts receivable and deferred revenues 
the decrease in was largely due to a non recurring million order from the us army received in april the remainder of the change in cash provided by operating activities in was due to increases in deferred taxes  and a receivable from coretrace 
the coretrace receivable of  consists of loans to coretrace plus related interest in net cash provided by used in investing activities was million in  million in and million in the cash used in investing activities in primarily related to the tappin acquisition of million  the purchase of a million certificate of deposit to secure a portion of the debt related to the tappin acquisition and  in property and equipment purchases 
the cash provided by investing activities for was from short term investment redemptions  net of property and equipment purchases 
cash used in investing activities in was for an investment of million in coretrace  a million net investment in short term certificates of deposit  and  which was used for additional furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements as renovations were made to our office 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in   in and  in the cash provided in primarily related to the proceeds of million in debt borrowed to fund the tappin acquisition and  related to proceeds received from the exercise of stock options 
net cash provided by financing activities in related to proceeds the company received from the exercise of stock options as well as tax benefits related to stock option expense 
loan agreements 
in order to finance the closing payment in the tappin acquisition  globalscape entered into two business loan agreements dated december  with the bank of san antonio 
the loan agreements provide for a million term loan which bears interest at per annum and is secured by substantially all of globalscape s consolidated assets and a million term loan which bears interest at per annum and is secured by a certificate of deposit with the bank of san antonio of million which bears interest at per annum 
both loans mature on december  interest and principal are payable in equal monthly installments on the first day of each calendar month beginning january  the loans may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty 
the loan agreements contain customary covenants including covenants relating to maintaining legal existence and good standing  complying with applicable laws  delivery of financial statements  payment of taxes and maintaining insurance 
globalscape and its subsidiaries are also prohibited from selling any of their assets other than in the ordinary course of business  acquiring any other entities  changing the types of business they are engaged in  incurring indebtedness other than that permitted by the loan agreements  incurring any liens on their assets other than those permitted by the loan agreements  making certain investments or paying any dividends on  or acquiring  any shares of their capital stock 
the loan agreements contain three financial covenants 
globalscape and its subsidiaries must maintain debt service coverage defined as net income depreciation interest non cash charges divided by the current portion of long term debt interest of beginning the first quarter of  debt to tangible net worth of beginning the first quarter of  and liquid assets cash and marketable securities of million during  million in and million in 
table of contents the loan agreements also contain customary events of default including the failure to make payments of principal and interests  the breach of any covenants  the occurrence of a material adverse change  and certain bankruptcy and insolvency events 
contractual obligations 
at december   our principal commitments consisted of obligations outstanding under loan arrangements  operating leases as well as royalty agreements with third parties  federal income tax and trade accounts payable 
the commitments related to royalty agreements are contingent on sales volumes 
we plan to continue to expend significant resources on product development in future periods and may also use our cash to acquire or license technology  intellectual property  products or businesses related to our current business strategy 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december   consisting of future minimum payments under operating leases and long term debt obligations payments due by fiscal year and thereafter total contractual obligations building lease equipment leases long term debt  principal and interest new accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended its guidance regarding testing goodwill for impairment 
because of concerns raised about recurring costs and the complexity of estimating the fair value of reporting units on an annual basis  the fasb decided to simplify how a company is required to test goodwill for impairment 
companies now have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if after considering the totality of events and circumstances an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  it will not have to perform the two step  quantitative impairment test 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   however  early adoption is permitted 
we have adopted this guidance as of december   and the implementation of this guidance does not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended its guidance regarding the accounting model for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements 
this guidance requires that hardware components of a tangible product containing software components always be excluded from the software revenue recognition 
this guidance also provides information on how to allocate consideration to deliverables in an arrangement that includes both tangible products and software 
this guidance is effective in fiscal years beginning on or after june  we have evaluated the effect of the adoption of this guidance as of december   and it does not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in october  the fasb amended its guidance regarding revenue recognition on multiple deliverable arrangements 
this guidance amends the criteria for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements 
this guidance also establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
the selling price used for each deliverable will be based on vsoe if available  third party evidence if vsoe is not available  or estimated selling price if neither vsoe nor third party evidence is available 
this amendment also replaces the term fair value in the revenue allocation guidance with selling price to clarify that the allocation of revenue is based on entity specific assumptions rather than assumptions of a marketplace participant 
this guidance eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires arrangement consideration be 
table of contents allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
the guidance also requires the best estimate of selling price be determined in a manner that is consistent with that used to determine the price to sell the deliverable on a standalone basis 
finally  this guidance significantly expands the disclosures related to multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
this guidance is effective in fiscal years beginning on or after june  we have evaluated the effect of the adoption of this guidance as of december   and it does not have a material effect on our financial statements 
critical accounting policies our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with us gaap 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition  impairment of goodwill  impairment of long lived assets  accounting for research and development costs  allowance for doubtful accounts  accounting for income taxes  and accounting for stock based compensation 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that have been prescribed for the software industry 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or service has been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectability is probable 
in making these judgments  we evaluate these criteria as follows evidence of an arrangement 
we consider a non cancelable written agreement signed by us and the customer to be persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
delivery has occurred 
we consider delivery to have occurred when a compact disc or other medium containing the licensed software is provided to a common carrier or in the case of electronic delivery  the customer is given electronic access to the licensed software 
if an arrangement includes undelivered products or services that are essential to the functionality of the delivered product  delivery is not considered to have occurred until these products or services are delivered 
fixed or determinable fee 
we consider the fee to be fixed or determinable unless the fee is subject to refund or adjustment or is not payable within normal payment terms 
if the fee is subject to refund or adjustment  we recognize revenue when the refund or adjustment right lapses or the return is estimable 
for arrangements with extended payment terms  we recognize revenue as amounts become due and payable or as cash is collected 
we grant a limited right of return to our customers 
collection is deemed probable 
we conduct a credit review for all transactions at the inception of an arrangement to determine the creditworthiness of the customer 
collection is deemed probable if  based upon our evaluation  we expect that the customer will be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as payments become due 
if we determine that collection is not probable  revenue is deferred and recognized upon cash collection 
the company also enters into perpetual software license agreements through direct sales to customers and indirect sales with distributors and resellers 
the license agreements generally include product maintenance and support agreements  for which the related revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the agreements 
in any given period if the amount of revenue that is deferred  which is equal to the total of that period s maintenance and support sales  is greater than the amount recognized  then revenue will decrease and vice versa 

table of contents in arrangements that include multiple elements  including perpetual software licenses and maintenance and or services  and packaged products with content updates  we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of the fair value of the undelivered elements  and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as revenue 
our deferred revenue consists primarily of the unamortized balance of enterprise product maintenance  consumer product support  and arrangements where vsoe does not exist 
deferred revenue totaled approximately million as of december   of which approximately million was classified as other long term liabilities in the balance sheets 
vsoe of each element is based on the price for which the undelivered element is sold separately 
we determine fair value of the undelivered elements based on historical evidence of our stand alone sales of these elements to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the undelivered elements 
when vsoe does not exist for undelivered items such as maintenance  then the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period 
we recognize hosting revenue  including setup fees on a monthly basis  over the contractual term of the customer contract 
we believe customers generally will continue to utilize our services beyond the initial contract term which typically ranges from one to three years 
as a result  setup fees are recognized ratably over the estimated average life of a customer relationship 
amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and either deferred revenue or revenue  depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 
while the above noted accounting standards govern the basis for revenue recognition  judgment and the use of estimates are required in connection with the allocation of revenue between software license revenue and maintenance and support revenue  as well as the amount of deferred revenue to be recognized in each accounting period 
changes to the elements in a software arrangement  the ability to identify vsoe for those elements  the fair value of the respective elements  and increasing flexibility in contractual arrangements could materially impact the amount recognized in the current period and deferred over time 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets goodwill 
we assess goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite life for impairment within our reporting units annually or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
during  the fasb issued final guidance on goodwill impairment testing providing companies with the option to perform a qualitative assessment in lieu of the annual quantitative impairment analysis 
for the year ended december   the company chose to adopt this new guidance  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   while early adoption is permitted 
this qualitative assessment analyzed the financial performance of the company  the performance of the wafs reporting unit  market conditions  specific company events and the excess of fair value over carrying value in the most recent quantitative assessment 
the results of this qualitative assessment concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the wafs reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
if an entity does not pass the qualitative assessment test  it must then perform the traditional two step impairment test on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the equity assigned to that unit  goodwill is not considered to be impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the equity assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of that reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we would record an impairment loss equal to the excess 
to determine the reporting units fair value in the prior year evaluation  we used the income approach under which we calculated the fair value of each reporting unit based on the estimated discounted future cash flows of that unit 
our cash flow assumptions were based on historical and forecasted revenue  operating costs  growth rates and other relevant factors 
if management s estimates of future operating results change  or if there are 
table of contents changes to other assumptions  the estimate of the fair value of our goodwill could change significantly 
such change could result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods  which could have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition 
in december  the company performed its annual impairment analysis  for the wafs reporting unit 
for this analysis  we estimated the fair value of goodwill using the discounted cash flows methodology 
the principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment were the projected results of operations  weighted average cost of capital wacc  working capital requirements  and terminal value assumptions 
this analysis required the input of several critical assumptions including future growth rates  cash flow projections  wacc  rate of return  and terminal value assumptions

the results of the analysis shows a carrying value of  as of december   compared to a fair value of  the fair value is more than double the carrying value and thus no impairment was recorded as of december  intangible assets 
we assess the impairment of other identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable 
based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment of long lived assets based on a projected undiscounted cash flow method using assumptions determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
our estimates of cash flows require significant judgment based on our historical results and anticipated results and are subject to many triggering factors which could change and cause a material impact to our operating results or financial condition 
allowance for doubtful accounts we regularly assess the collectability of outstanding customer invoices and  in so doing  we maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the non collection of customer receivables 
in estimating this allowance  we consider factors such as historical collection experience  a customer s current creditworthiness  customer concentration  age of the receivable balance  and general economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
actual customer collections could differ from our estimates and exceed our related loss allowance 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation by measuring the fair value of the award at the grant date and recognizing expense over the requisite service period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating expected dividends and measuring volatility 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
income taxes we recognize taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events in our financial statements 
accruals for uncertain tax positions are recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns  including uncertain tax positions and the realizability of

we derive our revenue primarily from sales of software licenses  maintenance and support  professional services and subscription based offerings 
software license revenue primarily consists of revenue from sales of our enterprise solutions  such as enhanced file transfer server and wafs  and is typically recognized upon shipment and maintenance and support revenue includes unspecified software license updates and product support 
maintenance and support revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual period  which is typically one year  but can be up to three years 
professional services revenue includes a variety of customization  implementation  and integration services  as well as delivery of education and training associated with our solutions  all of which are recognized as the services are performed 
in  we added subscription revenues related to the sales of our managed solutions which include mail express  managed information exchange mix and hosted enhanced file transfer hosted eft server 
subscription revenue is recognized on a monthly basis as the services are billed over the contract period  which ranges from one to three years 
revenues increased from million in to million in the increase of approximately million or in revenues was largely due to an increase in maintenance and support sales  an increase in the number of new eft server enterprise licenses sold  and an increased contribution from professional services 
the increase in maintenance and support sales was driven by an increase in sales of new multi year agreements and an increase in platinum support sales 
the following table reflects revenue by product in thousands including the related maintenance and support  or of revenue in and  or of revenue in for each product revenue for the year ended december  product eft server enterprise eft server cuteftp professional cuteftp home wide area file services cdp professional services other total operating revenues 
table of contents total revenue from our eft server and eft server enterprise solutions increased by  to million in from million in eft server enterprise revenues increased by from million in to million in  mainly due to an increase in maintenance and support contract renewals 
revenues from new license sales and new maintenance and support contracts remained relatively flat from to as a result of pricing pressure on eft server enterprise  a promotion during which discounted the price of eft server enterprise for customers upgrading from eft server and an increase in the number of customers purchasing cloud based solutions rather than installed solutions 
eft server revenue increased by from million in to million in this increase was mainly due to an increase in the average price of new license products and in maintenance and support contracts 
in total  our eft server and eft server enterprise products represented approximately of our total revenues in as compared to in revenues from cuteftp decreased by from million in to million in and accounted for approximately of total revenues in and in this decline continues the general reduction in cuteftp product revenues  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of revenues  experienced since the consumer ftp product market has substantial low cost  and even free  solutions that have put increasing pressure on cuteftp product revenues 
additional pressure on this product line comes from social media companies and services that allow consumers to share images and video 
our reliance on the current cuteftp products will continue to decline as we emphasize sales of our more complex enterprise products and potentially enter adjacent markets 
however  we intend to release a new version of cuteftp in this new version may slow  or even reverse  the recent decline in cuteftp revenue 
wide area file services and continuous data protection product revenues decreased by from million in to to million in and accounted for approximately of total revenues in as compared to in the decrease was due principally to a decrease in the average price of the wafs licenses and a decrease in the number of wafs maintenance and support renewals sold 
the wide area file services and continuous data protection products are largely used by architecture  engineering and construction firms to transfer large documents between offices 
the decline in wafs revenue in may be attributable in part to the current economic outlook in the architecture  engineering  and construction sectors 
in addition  we released wafs in the second half of this new release included a new user interface  support for unicode characters  and other significant enhancements from the prior version software 
some customers experienced difficulty while upgrading from wafs versions to wafs  which also led to delays in closing some sales opportunities while we identified and remediated the customer issues 
we have developed an update to wafs and intend to release that software by mid we believe the updated software will allow us to return to prior historical levels of wafs sales performance  depending on prevailing economic conditions in the primary market sectors served by wafs 
professional services increased by from  in to million in and accounted for of revenues in as compared to of revenue in the growth in professional services was driven largely by million in revenue earned on the mat contract during our level of participation on the mat contract may change during us government s fy depending on a variety of factors  including availability of government budget authorization for the sams e program and our evolving work share of the contract 
however  we believe we can continue to increase deliveries of our commercial non government professional services as we increasingly bundle those services with new sales of our enterprise solutions and as we sell repeat services to prior customers 
products and services included in the other revenue increased by from  in to  in this category primarily consist of mail express  managed information exchange mix and hosted enhanced file transfer hosted eft server sales 
other revenue accounted for of revenue in as compared to in the increase in other revenue was largely due to an increase in mix and hosted eft server revenue and mail express revenue 
we believe the mix and hosted eft server revenue increases are particularly significant as they reflect the growing trend toward cloud based rather than installed solutions 
in addition  these subscription services contribute to aggregate contract value and provide a predictable revenue stream in future periods 

table of contents during  we also continued to recognize increasing revenue from maintenance and support contracts 
maintenance and support revenues increased by  to million in from million in our deferred revenue balance increased from million at december  to million at december  as a result of higher maintenance and support sales including renewals over a month period  growing sales of our hosted and managed solutions  and increased sales of professional services engagements which were invoiced and  in many cases  paid but were not yet delivered 
the increase also reflects increased sales of our platinum support services  which provide after hours support and other benefits to customers contracting for this level of service instead of our standard support services 
as our enterprise products become a larger portion of our total revenues  we believe maintenance and support revenues will continue to increase 
however  if sales of our on premise enterprise products decrease  then new sales of maintenance and support contracts will decrease as well given the typical bundling of m s contracts with enterprise software solution sales 
maintenance and support pricing is reflective of the license cost of the products and the additional support it takes to maintain and support the products and customers 
with higher maintenance and support revenues  we will recognize additional deferred revenue as we earn the revenue over the life of the maintenance and support agreement 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists primarily of royalties  a portion of our bandwidth costs  hosted service expenses for our managed solutions  travel expenses associated with professional services delivery and cost of goods sold 
cost of revenues increased by approximately from  in to million in this increase was largely caused by an increase in royalties of  the addition of hosted server expenses of approximately  and other cost of goods sold of  the increase in royalties was due to increased sales of a licensed technology 
the hosted server expenses are associated with the mix and hosted eft server solution which launched in july  and february  respectively 
the other cost of goods sold primarily was from labor costs associated with the professional services performed for the mat contract 
our cost of revenues may continue to increase during and into future periods  depending largely on the scope of our future participation in sizable professional services projects like the mat contract

we also believe increasing numbers of customers are upgrading from eft server to eft server enterprise  in line with the solution suite approach announced with the release of eft server in these upgrades and new sales of eft server enterprise increased sales of that solution by  from approximately million in to almost million in  more than offsetting the decline in revenue from the more entry level eft server 
we believe the decline in revenue for eft server also reflects a sales promotion we ran in the second half of during which we delivered eft server for free  while upselling add on modules and m s contracts 
increased discussion of add on modules with sales prospects and prior customers also may have contributed to the increased sales of eft server enterprise which supports a range of add on modules in addition to those available for use with the base enterprise file transfer server 
the year to year increase in total eft server sales including eft server enterprise is noteworthy because it comes despite the inclusion of a large  non recurring us army order for eft server in in total  our eft server and eft server enterprise products represented approximately of our total revenues in as compared to in revenues from cuteftp decreased by from million in to million in and accounted for approximately of total revenues in and in this decline continues the general reduction in cuteftp product revenues  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of revenues  experienced since the consumer ftp product market has substantial low cost  and even free  solutions that have put increasing pressure on cuteftp product revenues
