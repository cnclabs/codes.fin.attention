intellectual property intellectual property  including patent protection  is very important to our business 
we file patent applications in the united states and other jurisdictions  and we also rely on trade secret protection and contractual arrangements to protect aspects of our business 
an enforceable patent with appropriate claim coverage can provide an advantage over competitors who may seek to employ similar approaches to develop therapeutics  and so our future commercial success will be in part dependent on our intellectual property strategy 
the information provided in this section should be reviewed in the context of the section entitled risks related to protecting our intellectual property that begins on page the development of biotechnology products  including ours  typically includes the early development of a technology  followed by rounds of increasingly focused innovation around a product opportunity  including identification and definition of a specific product candidate  manufacturing processes  product formulation and administration methods 
the result of this process is that biotechnology products are often protected by several families of patent filings that are filed at different times during product development and cover different aspects of the product 
consequently  earlier filed  broad technology patents will usually expire ahead of patents covering later developments such as product formulations  so that patent expirations on a product may span several years 
patent coverage may also vary from country to country based on the scope of available patent protection 
there are also opportunities to obtain extension of patent coverage for a product in certain countries  which add further complexity to the determination of patent life 
oncology the following table shows the estimated expiration dates for later filed composition of matter patents or patent applications for our two oncology drug product candidates 
because these product candidates are still under development  subsequent innovation and associated patent filings may provide additional patent coverage with later expiration dates 
examination of overseas patent applications typically lags behind us examination particularly where cases are filed first in the united states 
the stated expiration dates also do not account for potential patent extensions that may be available 
product us patent status europe patent status japan patent status candidate expiration date expiration date expiration date imetelstat issued issued issued grn issued pending pending an additional composition of matter patent application has been filed and  if issued  will provide european patent protection until our patent rights for imetelstat include those covering the nucleic acid sequence of htr  the rna component of telomerase  against which the oligonucleotide component of imetelstat is targeted  and the amidate nucleic acid chemistry used in that oligonucleotide  as well as manufacturing processes for the drug and composition claims to the drug molecule 
these patents and patent applications are wholly owned by geron 
the expiration dates on these patent families currently range from to 
table of contents we hold a worldwide  exclusive license to grn from angiochem  inc  under which we have rights to an issued us patent providing coverage for grn until in addition  the license includes patent applications in the united states and other countries covering proprietary peptides facilitating transport of therapeutic payloads across the bbb as well as patent claims to specific therapeutic compounds that employ these peptides  including grn our oncology research programs make use of our assets and expertise in areas including telomerase biology and nucleic acid chemistry 
our patent rights relating to telomerase  in addition to imetelstat  cover the cloned genes that encode the rna component htr and the catalytic protein component htert of human telomerase  cells that are immortalized by expression of recombinant htert  and cancer diagnostics based on detecting the expression of telomerase in cancer cells 
certain of these patents are in licensed or co owned with other entities including the universities of colorado  california and texas southwestern medical center 
our proprietary nucleic acid chemistry is covered by patent families that we acquired in from lynx therapeutics  inc  as well as in patents that we filed for further developments of this chemistry 
human embryonic stem cells geron played a leading role in the development of human embryonic stem cell hesc technologies for more than a decade  ranging from funding the original isolation of the cells in the laboratory of dr 
james thomson to the initiation of the first fda approved phase clinical trial of a hesc derived cell therapy 
over that time  geron scientists and collaborators developed technologies for differentiating and manufacturing hescs and we sought to protect these developments through patent filings 
as of december   our hesc patent portfolio includes issued or allowed united states patents  granted or accepted foreign patents and patent applications pending worldwide 
in addition to geron owned patents  the portfolio includes patents licensed to us exclusively and non exclusively  varying by field of use from the wisconsin alumni research foundation warf  and patent families exclusively licensed to us by the university of california  the university of oxford  the university of edinburgh  and the robarts research institute of the university of western ontario 
by way of example  our hesc portfolio includes patents and patent applications covering technologies that we believe may facilitate the commercial scale production of hescs  such as methods for growing the cells without the need for cell feeder layers  and novel synthetic growth surfaces that were developed in a collaboration between geron and corning life sciences 
we also own or have licensed patent rights covering cell types that can be made from hescs  including hepatocytes liver cells  cardiomyocytes heart muscle cells  neural cells nerve cells  including dopaminergic neurons and oligodendrocytes  chondrocytes cartilage cells  pancreatic islet cells  osteoblasts bone cells  hematopoietic cells blood forming cells and dendritic cells 
in november  we announced that we intend to divest our stem cell programs 
proceedings we endeavor to monitor worldwide patent filings by third parties that are relevant to our business 
based on this monitoring  we may determine that an action is appropriate to protect our business interests 
such actions may include negotiating patent licenses where appropriate  filing oppositions or reexaminations against a patent  or filing a request for the declaration of an interference with a us patent application or issued patent 
in  as part of our stem cell related business activities  we initiated a patent interference proceeding involving patent rights relating to the production of endoderm cells from hescs  and that proceeding  and a second related interference  are currently ongoing 
we are currently also involved in patent opposition proceedings before the european patent office and the australian patent office both as the party holding the opposed patent  and in opposition to patents granted or proposed to be granted to another entity 

table of contents intellectual property licensing we have granted licenses to a number of other organizations to utilize aspects of our technologies to develop and commercialize products outside of our oncology programs 
these include a worldwide exclusive license to viagen  inc under our patent rights for nuclear transfer technology for use in non human applications 
viagen provides animal cloning services in north america across a number of species for both agricultural and biomedical uses  and serves other parts of the world through partnerships and sublicenses 
geron holds a equity position in viagen  licenses to several biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to use telomerase immortalized cells in drug discovery research  licenses to several companies to commercialize telomerase immortalized cells for drug discovery applications  licenses to several companies to sell antibodies specific to telomerase for research purposes  licenses to several companies to develop and commercialize reagent kits  or to provide services  for the measurement of telomere length or telomerase activity for research purposes  a license to sienna cancer diagnostics to develop and commercialize a particular telomerase based technology for cancer detection  a license to a company for the development of cancer immunotherapies for veterinary applications  a worldwide  exclusive license to ge healthcare to develop and commercialize hesc derived cells to serve the drug discovery and toxicity testing market  a license to corning life sciences to develop and market synthetic surfaces to support the growth of hescs  licenses to several companies to develop and commercialize reagents useful for hesc culture  such as growth media  and an exclusive license to asia biotechnology corporation d b a ta sciences to commercialize telomerase activators for nutraceutical and cosmetic applications 
competition the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive 
other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and research organizations currently engage in or have in the past engaged in efforts related to the biological mechanisms that are the focus of our programs in oncology  including the study of telomeres  telomerase and receptor targeting peptides crossing the bbb 
we believe that the quality and breadth of our technology platforms  the skills of our employees and our ability to recruit and retain skilled employees  our patent portfolio and our capabilities for research and development are competitive strengths 
however  many large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have significantly larger intellectual property estates than we do  more substantial capital resources than we have  and greater capabilities and experience than we do in preclinical and clinical development  sales  marketing  manufacturing and regulatory affairs 
many companies are developing alternative therapies to treat cancer and  in this regard  are competitors of ours 
there are more than approved anti cancer products on the market in the united states  and several thousand in clinical development 
many of the pharmaceutical companies developing and marketing these competing products eg  glaxosmithkline  bristol myers squibb company and novartis ag have significantly greater financial resources and expertise than we do in research and development  manufacturing  preclinical and clinical testing  obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing  sales and distribution 
smaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors  particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies 
academic institutions  government agencies and other public and private research organizations may also conduct research  seek patent protection and establish collaborative 
table of contents arrangements for research  clinical development and marketing of products similar to ours 
these companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our programs 
we believe that our ability to successfully compete will depend on  among other things efficacy  safety and reliability of our product candidates  timing and scope of regulatory approvals and clearances  the speed at which we develop product candidates  our ability to complete preclinical testing and clinical development and obtaining regulatory approvals and clearances for product candidates  our ability to manufacture and sell commercial quantities of a product to the market  the availability of reimbursement for product use in approved indications  product acceptance by physicians and other health care providers  quality and breadth of our technology  skills of our employees and our ability to recruit and retain skilled employees  protection of our intellectual property  and availability of substantial capital resources to fund development and commercialization activities 
any products that we may develop or discover are likely to be in highly competitive markets 
we are aware of products in research or development by our competitors that address the diseases we are targeting  and any of these products may compete with our product candidates 
our competitors may succeed in developing their products before we do  obtaining approvals from the fda or other regulatory agencies for their products more rapidly than we do  or developing products that are more effective than our product candidates 
these products or technologies might render our technology obsolete or noncompetitive 
there may also be product candidates of which we are not aware at an earlier stage of development that may compete with our product candidates 
in addition  any product candidate that we successfully develop may need to compete or combine with existing therapies  many with long histories of use 
approved and established therapies in metastatic breast cancer include gemcitabine  paclitaxel  ixabepilone and capecitabine 
approved and established therapies in metastatic nsclc include bevacizumab  crizotinib  erlotinib and pemetrexed 
approved and established therapies in essential thrombocythemia include hydroxyurea  anagrelide and interferon alfa b 
approved and established therapies in multiple myeloma include bortezomib  lenalidomide and thalidomide 
imetelstat may compete or combine with these or other therapies 
whole brain radiation therapy wbrt and stereotactic radiosurgery srs are standards of care for brain metastases 
grn may compete or combine with these or other therapies 
government regulation regulation by governmental authorities in the united states and other countries is a significant factor in the development  manufacture and marketing of our proposed products and in our ongoing research and product development activities 
the nature and extent to which such regulation applies to us will vary depending on the nature of any products which may be developed by us 
we anticipate that many  if not all  of our proposed products will require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization 
in particular  human therapeutic products are subject to rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and other approval procedures of the fda and similar regulatory authorities in european and other countries 
various governmental statutes and regulations also govern or influence testing  manufacturing  safety  labeling  storage and recordkeeping related to such products and their marketing 
the process of obtaining these approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and money  and there can be no guarantee that approvals will be granted 

table of contents united states food and drug administration fda approval process prior to commencement of clinical trials involving humans  preclinical testing of new pharmaceutical products is generally conducted on animals in the laboratory to evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of the product candidate 
the results of these studies are submitted to the fda as part of an ind application  which must be cleared by the fda before clinical testing in humans can begin 
typically  clinical evaluation involves a time consuming and costly three phase trial process 
in phase  clinical trials are conducted with a small number of healthy volunteers or patients afflicted with a specific disease to assess safety and to evaluate the pattern of drug distribution and metabolism within the body 
in phase  clinical trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine preliminary efficacy  optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety 
the phase trials can be conducted comparing the investigational treatment to a comparator arm  or not 
if used  a comparator usually includes standard of care therapy 
safety and efficacy data from phase clinical trials  even if favorable  may not provide sufficient rationale for proceeding to a phase clinical trial 
in phase  large scale  multi center  comparative trials are conducted with patients afflicted with a target disease to provide sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety required by the fda 
the fda closely monitors the progress of each of the three phases of clinical testing and may  at its discretion  re evaluate  alter  suspend  or terminate the trials 
the results of the preclinical and clinical testing of small molecules or on non biologic drugs are submitted to the fda in the form of a new drug application nda for review and for approval prior to commencement of commercial sales 
in the case of large molecules  vaccines or gene and cell therapies  the results of clinical trials are submitted to the fda as a biologics license application bla 
in responding to an nda bla submission  the fda may grant marketing authorization  may request additional information  may deny the application if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval  and may also refuse to review an application that has been submitted if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for filing and review 
european and other regulatory approval process prior to initiating clinical trials in a region outside of the united states  a clinical trial application will need to be submitted and reviewed by the appropriate regulatory authority regulating the country in which the trial will be conducted 
whether or not fda clearance or approval has been obtained  approval of a product by comparable regulatory authorities in europe and other countries will be necessary prior to commencement of marketing the product in such countries 
the regulatory authorities in each country may impose their own requirements and may refuse to grant an approval  or may require additional data before granting it  even though the relevant product has been cleared or approved by the fda or another authority 
as with the fda  the regulatory authorities in the european union eu and other developed countries have lengthy approval processes for pharmaceutical products 
the process for gaining approval in particular countries varies  but generally follows a similar sequence to that described for fda approval 
in europe  the european medicine agency ema and the european committee for proprietary medicinal products cpmp provide a mechanism for eu member states to exchange information on all aspects of product licensing 
the eu has established a european medicine agency for the evaluation of medical products  with both a centralized procedure with which the marketing authorization is recognized in all eu member states and a decentralized procedure  the latter being based on the principle of licensing within one member country followed by mutual recognition by the other member countries 
other regulations we are also subject to various and often changing federal  state  local and international laws  rules  regulations  guidelines and recommendations relating to safe working conditions  laboratory and manufacturing practices and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances  including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents 

table of contents manufacturing a typical sequence of steps in the manufacture of imetelstat and grn drug products includes the following key components starting materials  which are well defined materials that are incorporated as significant structural fragments into the structure of a bulk drug substance  bulk drug substance  which is the active ingredient in a drug product that provides pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the treatment of disease  and final drug product  which is the finished dosage form that contains the drug substance  often in association with other active or inactive ingredients  that is shipped to the clinic for patient treatment 
the final drug products we use in clinical trials are produced by outside contractors 
we have no long term commitments or supply agreements with any of our imetelstat or grn suppliers 
if we are able to achieve regulatory approval in the united states or other countries to market and sell our products  we intend to continue to rely on outside contractors for the production of necessary supplies 
we are not planning to establish our own manufacturing capabilities 
imetelstat we currently employ a dual supplier strategy for production of starting materials used in the manufacture of imetelstat  as well as for production of imetelstat bulk drug substance and final drug product 
these manufacturers currently provide our clinical supply requirements on a proposal by proposal basis under master supply agreements 
we currently have a master service agreement with a single contractor for labeling and packaging of imetelstat final drug product and for distribution of imetelstat to clinical sites in north america 
in addition  we have a single contractor for qualified person release and distribution of imetelstat drug product to clinical sites in europe 
these contractors provide services on a proposal by proposal basis 
we have also entered into quality agreements with our imetelstat bulk drug substance and final drug product manufacturers  and our labeling  packaging and distribution service providers 
the master and quality agreements are designed to ensure product quality  compliance with cgmp  and oversight over all critical aspects of imetelstat production  testing  release  labeling and packaging  storage and distribution 
grn we currently have only a single supplier of grn bulk drug substance 
we employ a dual supplier strategy for production of the paclitaxel and angiopep peptide used in the manufacture of grn as well as for the production of grn final drug product 
our manufacturers provide our clinical supply requirements on a proposal by proposal basis under master supply agreements 
we currently have an agreement with only one contractor for distribution of grn and imetelstat drug product to clinical sites in north america 
this contractor provides distribution services under a master services agreement on a proposal by proposal basis 
we have also entered into quality agreements with our primary grn bulk drug substance and final drug product manufacturers 
the master and quality agreements are designed to ensure product quality  compliance with cgmp  and oversight over all critical aspects of grn production  testing  release  labeling and packaging  storage and distribution 
scientific consultants we have consulting agreements with a number of leading academic scientists and clinicians 
these individuals serve as key consultants  expert witnesses  or as members of clinical focus group panels with respect to our product development programs and strategies or in legal proceedings 
we use consultants to provide us with expert advice and consultation on our scientific and clinical programs and strategies  as well as on the ethical aspects of our work 
they also serve as important contacts for us throughout the broader scientific community 
they are distinguished scientists and clinicians with expertise in numerous scientific and medical fields  including telomere and telomerase biology  developmental biology  cellular biology  molecular biology and oncology 

table of contents we retain each consultant according to the terms of a consulting agreement 
under such agreements  we pay them a consulting fee and reimburse them for out of pocket expenses incurred in performing their services for us 
in addition  some consultants hold options to purchase our common stock and restricted stock awards  subject to the vesting requirements contained in the consulting agreements 
our consultants may be employed by other entities and therefore may have commitments to their employer  or may have other consulting or advisory agreements that may limit their availability to us

item a 
risk factors our business is subject to various risks  including those described below 
you should carefully consider these risk factors  together with all of the other information included in this form k 
any of these risks could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
risks related to our business our business is at an early stage of development  and we must overcome numerous risks and uncertainties to become successful 
our business is at an early stage of development  in that we do not yet have product candidates in late stage clinical trials or commercially available 
our ability to develop product candidates that progress to and through commercial launch is subject to our ability to  among other things achieve success in phase and phase clinical trials  collaborate successfully with clinical trial sites  academic institutions  physician investigators  clinical research organizations and other third parties  manufacture product candidates at commercially reasonable costs  obtain required regulatory clearances and approvals  maintain and enforce adequate intellectual property protection for our product candidates  and obtain financing on commercially reasonable terms to fund our operations 
there are many reasons why we may need to delay or abandon efforts to research  develop or obtain regulatory approvals to market our product candidates 
our product candidates require significant clinical testing prior to regulatory approval in the united states and other countries 
it may also be difficult to assess the success or failure of any of our clinical trials for many reasons  including but not limited to the subjectivity and changing landscape that accompanies the benefit to risk assessment in any given patient population  and because subpopulation data might not be available at the time we report top line data or other results 
our product candidates also may prove to have undesirable and unintended side effects or other characteristics adversely affecting their safety  efficacy 
table of contents or cost effectiveness that could prevent or limit their approval for marketing and successful commercial use 
in addition  they may not prove to be more effective for treating disease than current therapies 
competitors may also have proprietary rights that prevent us from developing and marketing our products  or those competitors may sell similar  superior or lower cost products that make our products unsuitable for marketing 
our product candidates also may not be able to be manufactured in commercial quantities at an acceptable cost 
all of the foregoing factors could delay or prevent us from commercializing and marketing our product candidates  which would materially adversely affect our business 
our research and development programs are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 
the science and technology of telomere biology and telomerase  as well as receptor targeting peptides that cross the blood brain barrier bbb  are relatively new 
there is no precedent for the successful commercialization of therapeutic product candidates based on these technologies 
in addition  we  our licensees  and our collaborators must undertake significant research and development activities to develop product candidates based on these technologies  which will require additional funding and may take years to accomplish  if ever 
because of the significant scientific  regulatory and commercial milestones that must be reached for any of our research and development programs to be successful  any program may be delayed or abandoned  even after we have expended significant resources on it 
such a delay or abandonment of our programs in telomerase technology or receptor targeting peptide technology to cross the bbb  would have a material adverse effect on our business 
in our phase clinical trials of imetelstat  we observed dose limiting toxicities  including thrombocytopenia when the drug was used as a single agent  and neutropenia when the drug was used in combination with paclitaxel  as well as a low incidence of severe infusion reactions 
we also did not observe single agent efficacy with imetelstat in our phase program 
further  the information we have related to the ability of grn to penetrate brain tissue and its anti tumor activity is preliminary and based on phase clinical trials conducted by angiochem 
in the phase trials of grn  grade neutropenia was the primary dose limiting toxicity observed 
in our phase clinical trials of imetelstat or grn  we may observe similar dose limiting toxicities or other safety issues which may require us to conduct additional  unforeseen trials or abandon these programs entirely 
if we are not able to divest our stem cell assets for substantial financial value  or at all  the proceeds of the divestiture will be limited and our stock price may decline 
our stem cell programs are at an early stage of development  and we can give no assurance regarding the consideration we will receive  if any  for their disposition 
in addition  some of our investors purchased shares of our common stock because they were interested in the opportunities presented by our human embryonic stem cell programs 
thus  certain stockholders attribute substantial financial value to our stem cell assets  and that we will receive such value through the divestiture of the stem cell programs 
however  we can give no assurance that we will receive the financial value that these stockholders may attribute to our stem cell assets  or any financial value at all  and  as a result  our stock price may decline 
risks related to clinical and commercialization activities our ability to complete ongoing clinical trials on a timely basis is subject to risks and uncertainties related to factors such as patient enrollment  drug supply and regulatory approval 
completion of ongoing clinical trials of our product candidates may be delayed  or not occur  due to insufficient patient enrollment  which is a function of many factors  including the size and nature of the patient populations  the nature of the protocols  the proximity of patients to clinical sites  the availability of effective treatments for the relevant disease  and the eligibility criteria for the clinical trials 
other delays could be caused by disruptions in drug supply  not receiving timely regulatory clearances or approvals  including  for example  acceptance of new manufacturing specifications by regulatory authorities  unavailability of any study related treatment including comparator therapy  or unanticipated issues with key vendors of clinical services  such as contract research organizations 

table of contents for example  enrollment in our phase trials of imetelstat in multiple myeloma and essential thrombocythemia has been slower than expected and with respect to our clinical studies of grn  we have aggressive enrollment goals 
delays in timely completion of clinical testing of our product candidates could increase research and development costs and could prevent or would delay us from obtaining regulatory approval for our product candidates  both of which would likely have a material adverse effect on our business 
additionally  we can give no assurance that our enrollment goals will be met as we have projected  or at all 
delays in the initiation of later stage clinical testing of our current product candidates could result in increased costs to us and would delay our ability to generate revenues 
the commencement of later stage clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons  including delays in demonstrating sufficient safety and efficacy in phase clinical trials to obtain regulatory clearance to commence a phase clinical trial  obtaining sufficient funding  manufacturing sufficient quantities of drug  producing drugs that meet the quality standards of the fda and other regulatory agencies  ensuring our ability to manufacture drugs at acceptable costs for later stage clinical trials and commercialization  obtaining clearance or approval of a proposed trial design or manufacturing specifications from the fda and other regulatory authorities  reaching agreement on acceptable terms with our collaborators on all aspects of the clinical trial  including the contract research organizations and the trial sites  and obtaining institutional review board approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site 
we may not be able to manufacture at costs or scales necessary to conduct our clinical programs or potential future commercialization activities 
our product candidates are likely to be more expensive to manufacture than most other treatments currently available today or that may be available in the future 
the commercial cost of manufacturing imetelstat and grn will need to be significantly lower than our current costs in order for these product candidates to become commercially successful products 
oligonucleotides are relatively large molecules produced using complex chemistry  and the cost of manufacturing an oligonucleotide like imetelstat is greater than the cost of making typical small molecule drugs 
our present imetelstat manufacturing processes are conducted at a relatively modest scale appropriate for phase clinical trials 
similarly  our grn manufacturing processes are currently conducted at a relatively small scale  and there is also limited history of manufacturing of grn accordingly  we can provide no assurance that we will achieve sufficient scale increases or cost reductions necessary for successful commercial production of imetelstat or grn additionally  given the complexities of our manufacturing process  the resulting costs that we incur to conduct our clinical trials may be higher than would be anticipated for other comparable treatments  requiring us to expend relatively larger amounts of cash to complete our clinical trials 
manufacturing our product candidates is subject to process and technical challenges and regulatory risk 
we face numerous risks and uncertainties with regard to manufacturing imetelstat and grn regulatory requirements for product quality of oligonucleotide products are less well defined than for small molecule drugs  and there is no guarantee that we will achieve sufficient product quality standards required for phase clinical trials or for commercial approval and manufacturing of imetelstat 
similarly  our grn manufacturing process  including the consistency and quality of batches made  while appropriate for phase clinical trials  will need to improve to meet regulatory requirements for phase clinical trials and commercial approval 
also  changes in our manufacturing processes for imetelstat or grn made during later stages of clinical development  including during phase trials  may result in regulatory delays  the need for further clinical studies  or rejection of a marketing application by regulatory authorities  which would result in a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents we do not have experience as a company in conducting large scale  late stage clinical trials  or in those areas required for the successful commercialization of our product candidates 
we have no experience in conducting large scale  late stage clinical trials 
we cannot be certain that any large scale  late stage planned clinical trials will begin or be completed on time  if at all 
large scale  late stage clinical trials will require additional financial and management resources and reliance on third party clinical investigators  cros and consultants 
relying on third party clinical investigators or cros may cause delays that are outside of our control 
any such delays could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we also do not have commercialization capabilities for our product candidates 
developing an internal sales  marketing and distribution capability would be an expensive and time consuming process 
we may not be able to enter into third party marketing and distribution agreements on terms that are economically attractive  or at all 
even if we do enter into such agreements  these third parties may not successfully market or distribute any of our product candidates 
obtaining regulatory approvals to market our product candidates in the united states and other countries is a costly and lengthy process  and we cannot predict whether or when we will be permitted to commercialize our product candidates 
federal  state and local governments in the united states and governments in other countries have significant regulations in place that govern many of our activities and may prevent us from creating commercially viable products from our discoveries  and from successfully conducting our development efforts and commercializing our product candidates 
the regulatory process  particularly for biopharmaceutical product candidates like ours  is uncertain  can take many years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
our potential product candidates will require extensive preclinical and clinical testing prior to submission of any regulatory application seeking approval to commence commercial sales 
in particular  human pharmaceutical therapeutic product candidates are subject to rigorous requirements of the fda in the united states and similar health authorities in other countries in order to demonstrate safety and efficacy 
data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory agency approvals 
for example  safety and efficacy data from any of our phase clinical trials  even if favorable  may not provide sufficient rationale for us to proceed to a phase clinical trial 
in addition  delays or rejections may be encountered as a result of changes in regulatory environment or regulatory agency policy during the period of product development and or the period of review of any application for regulatory agency approval for a product candidate 
any product candidate that we  or our collaborators  develop must receive all relevant regulatory agency approvals before it may be marketed in the united states or other countries 
obtaining regulatory approval is a lengthy  expensive and uncertain process 
because certain of our product candidates involve the application of new technologies or are based upon a new therapeutic approach  they may be subject to substantial additional review by various government regulatory authorities  and  as a result  the process of obtaining regulatory approvals for them may proceed more slowly than for product candidates based upon more conventional technologies 
delays in obtaining regulatory agency approvals could significantly harm the marketing of any products that we or our collaborators develop  impose costly procedures upon our activities or the activities of our collaborators  diminish any competitive advantages that we or our collaborators may attain  or adversely affect our ability to receive royalties and generate revenues and profits 
even if we commit the necessary time and resources  the required regulatory agency approvals may not be obtained for any product candidates developed by us or in collaboration with us 
if we obtain regulatory agency approval for a new product  this approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses or other aspects of the product label for which it can be marketed that could limit the potential commercial use of the product 

table of contents failure to achieve continued compliance with government regulation over approved products could delay or halt commercialization of our products 
approved products and their manufacturers are subject to continual review  and discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or its manufacturer may result in restrictions on the product or manufacturer  including withdrawal of the product from the market 
the future sale by us or our collaborators of any commercially viable product will be subject to government regulation related to numerous matters  including the processes of manufacturing  advertising and promoting  selling and marketing  labeling  and distribution 
if  and to the extent that  we are unable to comply with these regulations  our ability to earn revenues from product sales will be materially and negatively impacted 
failure to comply with regulatory requirements can result in severe civil and criminal penalties  including but not limited to recall or seizure of products  injunction against the manufacture  distribution and sales and marketing of products  and criminal prosecution 
the imposition of any of these penalties or other commercial limitations could significantly impair our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to our relationships with third parties we depend on other parties to help us develop and test our product candidates  and our ability to develop and commercialize product candidates may be impaired or delayed if collaborations are unsuccessful 
our strategy for the development  clinical testing and commercialization of our product candidates requires that we enter into collaborations with clinical research organizations  vendors  corporate partners  licensors  licensees and others 
we are dependent upon the ability of these parties to perform their responsibilities reliably 
by way of example  we have contracted with two clinical research organizations that are primarily responsible for the execution of clinical site related activities for our imetelstat and grn phase clinical studies  including clinical trial site monitoring activities 
in addition  we have contracted with single vendors for each of our clinical programs to develop and maintain the clinical databases for each respective program  and a single vendor maintains our safety database for both programs 
accordingly  if the performance of these services is not of the highest quality  or does not achieve necessary regulatory compliance standards  or if such organization or vendor stops or delays its performance for any reason  it would impair and delay our ability to report data from our clinical trials and make the necessary representations to regulatory authorities  if at all 
the development and commercialization of our product candidates will be delayed if collaborators  contractors or other partners fail to conduct these activities in a timely manner or at all 
in addition  our collaborators could terminate their agreements with us and we may not receive any development or milestone payments 
if we do not achieve milestones set forth in agreements with collaborators  or if our collaborators breach or terminate their collaborative agreements with us  our business may be materially harmed 

table of contents our ability to manufacture our product candidates and products is risky and uncertain because we must rely on third parties for manufacturing 
there may be shortages of key materials  and we may have only one source of manufacture or supply 
we rely on other companies for certain process development  supply of starting materials  manufacturing or other technical and scientific work with respect to our imetelstat and grn product candidates  but we do not have direct control over their personnel or operations 
if these companies do not perform the work which they were assigned or do not complete the work within the expected timelines  or if they choose to exit the business  our ability to develop or manufacture our product candidates could be significantly harmed 
for example  we may need to change one or more of our suppliers due to these or other reasons and the change could lead to delays in drug supply 
in addition  we have not established long term agreements for the supply of imetelstat or grn in addition  our manufacturers may need to make substantial investments to enable sufficient capacity increases  cost reductions  and to implement those regulatory and compliance standards necessary for successful phase trials and commercial production 
we can provide no assurance that our manufacturers will achieve such capacity increases  cost reductions  or regulatory and compliance standards  and even if they do  that such achievements will be at a commercially reasonable cost to us 
there are other risks and uncertainties that we face with respect to manufacturing 
for example  we do not have a secondary source for the supply of grn bulk drug substance unformulated peptide paclitaxel conjugate 
in addition  we currently have an agreement with only a single contractor for distribution of imetelstat and grn final drug product to clinical sites in north america 
as another example  certain commonly used reagents and solvents can experience market shortages and  if these shortages occur  they may adversely impact our ability to manufacture our product candidates 
our reliance on the activities of our consultants  research institutions  and scientific contractors  whose activities are not wholly within our control  may lead to delays in development of our product candidates 
we rely extensively upon and have relationships with scientific consultants and contractors at academic and other institutions 
some of our scientific consultants and contractors conduct research at our request  and others assist us in formulating our research and development and clinical strategy or other matters 
these consultants and contractors are not our employees and may have commitments to  or consulting or advisory contracts with  other entities that may limit their availability to us 
we have limited control over the activities of these consultants and contractors and  except as otherwise required by our collaboration and consulting agreements  can expect only limited amounts of their time to be dedicated to our activities 
in addition  we have formed research collaborations with many academic and other research institutions throughout the world 
these research facilities may have commitments to other commercial and noncommercial entities 
we have limited control over the operations of these laboratories and can expect only limited amounts of their time to be dedicated to our research goals 
if any of these third parties are unable or refuse to contribute to projects on which we need their help  our ability to generate advances in our technologies and develop our product candidates could be significantly harmed 
risks related to our financial position and need for additional financing we have a history of losses and anticipate future losses  and continued losses could impair our ability to sustain operations 
we have incurred operating losses every year since our operations began in as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with our research and development activities and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations 
we expect to incur additional operating losses and  as our development efforts and clinical testing activities continue  our operating losses may increase in size 
substantially all of our revenues to date have been research support payments under collaboration agreements and revenues from our licensing arrangements 
we may be unsuccessful in entering into any new corporate collaboration or license agreements that result in revenues 
we do not expect that the revenues generated from these arrangements will be sufficient alone to continue or expand our research or development activities and otherwise sustain our operations 

table of contents while we receive royalty revenue from licenses  we do not expect to receive sufficient royalty revenues from these licenses to independently sustain our operations 
our ability to continue or expand our research and development activities and otherwise sustain our operations is dependent on our ability  alone or with others  to  among other things  discover  develop  manufacture and market therapeutic products 
we also expect to experience negative cash flow for the foreseeable future as we fund our operating losses and capital expenditures 
this will result in decreases in our working capital  total assets and stockholders equity  which may not be offset by future financings 
we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability 
we may not be able to generate these revenues  and we may never achieve profitability 
our failure to achieve profitability could negatively impact the market price of our common stock and our ability to sustain operations 
even if we do become profitable  we cannot assure you that we would be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
we will need additional capital to conduct our operations and develop our product candidates  and our ability to obtain the necessary funding is uncertain 
we will require substantial capital resources in order to conduct our operations and develop our product candidates  and we cannot assure you that our existing capital resources  interest income and equipment financing arrangement will be sufficient to fund future planned operations 
the timing and degree of any future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the accuracy of the assumptions underlying our estimates for our capital needs for and beyond  changes in our clinical development plans for our product candidates  imetelstat and grn  our ability to meaningfully reduce manufacturing costs of current product candidates  the magnitude and scope of our research and development programs  including the number and type of product candidates we intend to pursue  the progress we make in our research and development programs  preclinical development and clinical trials  our ability to establish  enforce and maintain strategic arrangements for research  development  clinical testing  manufacturing and marketing  the timing of a divesture of or partnering for our stem cell program assets and the consideration we may receive as result of such divesture or partnering transaction  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals and clearances  and the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims 
additional financing through strategic collaborations  public or private equity financings  capital lease transactions or other financing sources may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
the receptivity of the public and private equity markets to proposed financings is substantially affected by the general economic  market and political climate and by other factors which are unpredictable and over which we have no control 
additional equity financings  if we obtain them  could result in significant dilution to our stockholders 
further  in the event that additional funds are obtained through arrangements with collaborative partners  these arrangements may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies  product candidates or proposed products that we would otherwise seek to develop and commercialize ourselves 
if sufficient capital is not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  suspend or eliminate one or more of our programs  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
for example  in november we announced that we were discontinuing further development of our human embryonic stem cell programs in order to focus on our oncology programs 

table of contents risks related to protecting our intellectual property our success will depend on our ability to protect our technologies and our product candidates through patents and other intellectual property rights and to operate without infringing the rights of others 
if we or our licensors are unsuccessful in either of these regards  the value of our technologies and product candidates will be adversely affected and we may be unable to continue our development work 
protection of our proprietary technology is critically important to our business 
our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and enforce our patents and maintain trade secrets  both in the united states and in other countries 
by way of example  we do not yet have issued patents for grn in europe or japan  or for imetelstat in europe after further  our patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  and our patent rights may not provide proprietary protection or competitive advantages to us 
in the event that we or our licensors are unsuccessful in obtaining and enforcing patents  we may not be able to further develop or commercialize our product candidates and our business would be negatively impacted 
by way of example  we depend in part on the ability of angiochem to obtain  maintain and enforce patent rights for the proprietary peptide drug conjugate technology that we have licensed 
publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries by at least several months and sometimes several years 
therefore  the persons or entities that we or our licensors name as inventors in our patents and patent applications may not have been the first to invent the inventions disclosed in the patent applications or patents  or the first to file patent applications for these inventions 
as a result  we may not be able to obtain patents for discoveries that we otherwise would consider patentable and that we consider to be extremely significant to our future success 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies  including ours  are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and technical questions 
in particular  legal principles for biotechnology and pharmaceutical patents in the united states and in other countries are evolving  and the extent to which we will be able to obtain patent coverage to protect our technology  or enforce issued patents  is uncertain 
if we infringe the patents of others  we may be blocked from continuing development work or be required to obtain licenses on terms that may impact the value of our product candidates 
challenges to our patent rights can result in costly and time consuming legal proceedings that may prevent or limit development of our product candidates 
our patents may be challenged through administrative or judicial proceedings 
such proceedings are typically lengthy and complex  and an adverse decision can result in the loss of important patent rights 
for example  where more than one party seeks us patent protection for the same technology  the patent office may declare an interference proceeding in order to ascertain the party to which the patent should be issued 
patent interferences are typically complex  highly contested legal proceedings  subject to appeal 
they are usually expensive and prolonged  and can cause significant delay in the issuance of patents 
notably  under the america invents act aia signed into law in september  interference proceedings will be eliminated in march  to be replaced with other types of proceedings  including post grant review procedures 
until such time  our pending patent applications  or our issued patents  may be drawn into interference proceedings which may delay or prevent the issuance of patents  or result in the loss of issued patent rights 
certain jurisdictions  such as europe  new zealand and australia  permit oppositions to be filed against granted patents or patents proposed to be granted 
because our intent is to commercialize products internationally  securing both proprietary protection and freedom to operate outside of the united states is important to our business 
we are involved in both opposing the grant of patents to others through such opposition proceedings and in defending our patent applications against oppositions filed by others 
for example  we have been involved in several patent oppositions before the epo with a series of companies gemvax  pharmexa and kael gemvax developing gv  a cancer vaccine that employs a short telomerase peptide to induce an immune response against telomerase 
the rights to gv passed from gemvax  a norwegian company  to pharmexa  a danish company  as a result of a acquisition 
in late  pharmexa reported that it sold its telomerase vaccine program to a korean company  kael co 
ltd  and the continuing company now operates under the name kael gemvax 
various clinical studies of gv are underway  including a phase combination study in pancreatic cancer 
pharmexa originally obtained a european patent with broad claims to the use of telomerase vaccines for the 
table of contents treatment of cancer  and we opposed that patent in in  the opposition division od of the epo revoked the claims originally granted to pharmexa  but permitted pharmexa to add new  narrower claims limited to five specific small peptide fragments of telomerase 
the decision was appealed to the technical board of appeals tba 
in august  the tba ruled  consistent with the decision of the od  that pharmexa was not entitled to the originally granted broad claims but was only entitled to the narrow claims limited to the five small peptides 
kael gemvax was recently granted a further related european patent covering its telomerase peptide vaccine against which we have filed an opposition 
that opposition is ongoing and we cannot predict the outcome 
in parallel  pharmexa opposed a european patent held by us  the claims of which cover many facets of human telomerase  including the use of telomerase peptides in cancer vaccines 
in june  the od of the epo revoked three of the granted claims in our patent  specifically the three claims covering telomerase peptide cancer vaccines 
the remaining claims were upheld  and that decision was recently affirmed by the tba 
we have now been awarded a second european patent with claims to telomerase peptides  and this patent has also been opposed by kael gemvax 
we believe that gv is covered by our telomerase patents and our goal in these proceedings is to maintain strong patent protection that will enable us to enter into a licensing arrangement with kael gemvax that could result in commercial benefit for geron if gv is successfully commercialized 
we cannot predict the outcome of this opposition or any subsequent appeal of the decision in the opposition 
european opposition and appeal proceedings can take several years to reach final decision 
the oppositions discussed above reflect the complexity of the patent landscape in which we operate  and illustrate the risks and uncertainties 
we are also currently involved in other patent opposition proceedings in europe and australia 
under the aia  effective in march  us patents will be subject to post grant review procedures similar to european oppositions 
patents owned or licensed by us may therefore be subject to post grant review procedures  as well as other forms of review and reexamination 
a decision in such proceedings adverse to our interests could result in the loss of valuable patent rights and negatively impact our business 
as more groups become engaged in scientific research and product development in the areas of telomerase biology and peptide drug conjugates for delivery of therapeutics across the bbb  the risk of our patents being challenged through patent interferences  oppositions  reexaminations  litigation or other means will likely increase 
challenges to our patents through these procedures can be extremely expensive and time consuming  even if the outcome is favorable to us 
an adverse outcome in a patent dispute could severely harm our business by causing us to lose patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction s  subjecting us to litigation  or otherwise preventing us from commercializing product candidates in the relevant jurisdiction s  requiring us to obtain licenses to the disputed patents  forcing us to cease using the disputed technology  or requiring us to develop or obtain alternative technologies 
by way of example  an anonymous party has recently filed papers at the european patent office challenging the proposed issuance of a patent to angiochem that is relevant to grn if such challenges to our patent rights covering our drug candidates are not resolved promptly in our favor  our existing business relationships may be jeopardized and we could be delayed or prevented from entering into new collaborations or from commercializing certain products  which could materially harm our business 
if we fail to meet our obligations under license agreements  we may lose our rights to key technologies on which our business depends 
our business depends on several critical technologies that are based in part on patents licensed from third parties  including the exclusive worldwide license rights we obtained from angiochem in december those third party license agreements impose obligations on us  such as payment obligations and obligations to diligently pursue development of commercial products under the licensed patents 
if a licensor believes that we have failed to meet our obligations under a license agreement  the licensor could seek to limit or terminate our license rights  which could lead to costly and time consuming litigation and  potentially  a loss of the licensed rights 
during the 
table of contents period of any such litigation our ability to carry out the development and commercialization of product candidates could be significantly and negatively affected 
if our license rights were restricted or ultimately lost  our ability to continue our business based on the affected technology would be severely adversely affected 
we may be subject to infringement claims that are costly to defend  and which may limit our ability to use disputed technologies and prevent us from pursuing research and development or commercialization of product candidates 
our commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing patents and the proprietary rights of others 
our technologies may infringe the patents or proprietary rights of others 
in addition  we may become aware of discoveries and technology controlled by third parties that are advantageous to our programs 
in the event our technologies infringe the rights of others or we require the use of discoveries and technology controlled by third parties  we may be prevented from pursuing research  development or commercialization of product candidates or may be required to obtain licenses to those patents or other proprietary rights or develop or obtain alternative technologies 
we have obtained licenses from several universities and companies for technologies that we anticipate incorporating into our product candidates  and we initiate negotiation for licenses to other technologies as the need or opportunity arises 
we may not be able to obtain a license to patented technology on commercially favorable terms  or at all 
if we do not obtain a necessary license  we may need to redesign our technologies or obtain rights to alternate technologies  the research and adoption of which could cause delays in our product development 
in cases where we are unable to license necessary technologies  we could be prevented from developing certain product candidates 
our failure to obtain alternative technologies or a license to any technology that we may require to research  develop or commercialize our product candidates would significantly and negatively affect our business 
by way of example  we are aware of at least one entity that is seeking to obtain patent claims that may  if granted  be argued to read on imetelstat 
while such claims have not been issued  and may not be valid if they do issue  we expect that as our product candidates continue to progress in development  we will see more efforts by others to obtain patents that are positioned to cover our product candidates 
much of the information and know how that is critical to our business is not patentable  and we may not be able to prevent others from obtaining this information and establishing competitive enterprises 
we sometimes rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary technology  especially in circumstances in which we believe patent protection is not appropriate or available 
we attempt to protect our proprietary technology in part by confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants  collaborators and contractors 
we cannot provide assurance that these agreements will not be breached  that we would have adequate remedies for any breach  or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors  any of which would harm our business significantly 
our ability to divest our stem cell programs  and the value that we receive from any such arrangements depends at least in part on the strength of our hesc related intellectual property 
we developed an extensive portfolio of geron owned patent filings covering our prior development of hesc technologies  as well as patents that we licensed from other parties 
this intellectual property is a substantial component of the stem cell assets that we are seeking to divest 
our ability to divest our hesc programs  and the value that we receive will depend in part on the strength  scope and term of the patents in our hesc portfolio  as well as our ability to maintain our license rights to the patents that we licensed from third parties 
legal developments and proceedings that may impact the value of our hesc patent portfolio include european court ruling in  the european court of justice ecj rendered a decision in a case known as br stle v 
greenpeace that is widely viewed to have effectively abolished the ability to enforce patents on hesc technologies in member states of the european union eu 
this decision may reduce the value of our hesc patent portfolio in a partnering deal 
patent interferences two of our patent applications covering the production of endoderm from hescs part of the process for making pancreatic islet cells are involved in interferences with patents held by viacyte  inc a number of outcomes are possible i the claims may be awarded to viacyte  ii the claims may be awarded to us  or iii neither party may be found to be entitled to the claims 
the decision from the patent office may also be subject to appeal 
since the interferences are still ongoing  we cannot predict what the outcome will be 

table of contents reexaminations in july  requests were filed on behalf of the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights now renamed as consumer watchdog for reexamination of three issued us patents owned by the wisconsin alumni foundation warf 
these three patents us patent nos 
  and  are licensed to us pursuant to a january license agreement which conveys exclusive rights to us under the warf patents for the development and commercialization of therapeutics based on neural cells  cardiomyocytes and pancreatic islet cells  derived from hescs  as well as non exclusive rights for other product opportunities 
after initially rejecting the patent claims  the patent office issued decisions in all three cases upholding the patentability of the claims as amended 
the decisions to uphold the  and  patents are final and not subject to further appeal 
consumer watchdog appealed the decision on the  patent and  in april  the board of patent appeals and interferences reversed the earlier decision of the patent office on the  patent and remanded the case back to the patent office for further prosecution 
in november   the patent office again upheld the patentability of the claims 
the case could be subject to further appeal 
risks related to competitive factors the loss of key personnel could slow our ability to conduct research and develop product candidates 
our future success depends to a significant extent on the skills  experience and efforts of our executive officers and key members of our clinical and scientific staff 
we face intense competition for qualified individuals from numerous pharmaceutical  biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  as well as academic and other research institutions 
we may be unable to retain our current personnel or attract or assimilate other highly qualified management and scientific personnel in the future on acceptable terms 
the loss of any or all of these individuals could harm our business and might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of research  development or business objectives 
some of our competitors may develop technologies that are superior to or more cost effective than ours  which may significantly impact the commercial viability of our technologies and damage our ability to sustain operations 
the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive 
other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and research organizations currently engage in or have in the past engaged in efforts related to the biological mechanisms that are the focus of our programs in oncology therapies  including the study of telomeres  telomerase and receptor targeting peptides crossing the bbb 
in addition  other products and therapies that could directly compete with the product candidates that we are seeking to develop and market currently exist or are being developed by pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies and by academic and other research organizations 
many companies are developing alternative therapies to treat cancer and  in this regard  are competitors of ours 
there are more than approved anti cancer products on the market in the united states  and several thousand in clinical development 
many of the pharmaceutical companies developing and marketing these competing products eg  glaxosmithkline  bristol myers squibb company and novartis ag have significantly greater financial resources and expertise than we do in research and development  manufacturing  preclinical and clinical testing  obtaining regulatory approvals  and marketing  sales and distribution 
smaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors  particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies 
academic institutions  government agencies and other public and private research organizations may also conduct research  seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research  clinical development and marketing of products similar to ours 
these companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our programs 

table of contents in addition to the above factors  we expect to face competition in the following areas product efficacy and safety  the timing and scope of regulatory consents  availability of resources  reimbursement coverage  price  and patent position  including potentially dominant patent positions of others 
as a result of the foregoing  our competitors may develop more effective or more affordable products  or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than we do 
most significantly  competitive products may render any product candidates that we develop obsolete  which would negatively impact our business and ability to sustain operations 
to be successful  our product candidates must be accepted by the health care community  which can be very slow to adopt or unreceptive to new technologies and products 
our product candidates and those developed by our collaborators  if approved for marketing  may not achieve market acceptance since hospitals  physicians  patients or the medical community in general may decide not to accept and utilize these products 
the product candidates that we are attempting to develop will compete with a number of conventional drugs and therapies manufactured and marketed by major pharmaceutical companies 
the degree of market acceptance of any of our developed product candidates will depend on a number of factors  including our establishment and demonstration to the medical community of the clinical efficacy and safety of our product candidates  our ability to create products that are superior to alternatives currently on the market  our ability to establish in the medical community the potential advantage of our treatments over alternative treatment methods  and reimbursement policies of government and third party payers 
if the health care community does not accept our product candidates for any of the foregoing reasons  or for any other reason  our business would be materially harmed 
if we fail to obtain acceptable prices or adequate reimbursement for our product candidates  the use of our product candidates could be severely limited 
our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates will depend significantly on our ability to obtain acceptable prices and the availability of reimbursement to the patient from third party payers 
in march  the patient protection and affordability care act  as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act collectively  the ppaca became law 
the ppaca contains numerous initiatives that impact the pharmaceutical industry 
these include  among other things increasing existing price rebates in federally funded health care programs  expanding rebates  or other pharmaceutical company discounts  into new programs  imposing a new non deductible excise tax on sales of certain prescription pharmaceutical products by prescription drug manufacturers and importers  reducing incentives for employer sponsored health care  creating an independent commission to propose changes to medicare with a particular focus on the cost of biopharmaceuticals in medicare part d  providing a government run public option with biopharmaceutical price setting capabilities  
table of contents allowing the secretary of health and human services to negotiate drug prices within medicare part d directly with pharmaceutical manufacturers  reducing the number of years of data exclusivity for innovative biological products potentially leading to earlier biosimilar competition  and increasing oversight by the fda of pharmaceutical research and development processes and commercialization tactics 
while the ppaca may increase the number of patients who have insurance coverage for our product candidates  its cost containment measures could also adversely affect reimbursement for our product candidates 
cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we receive for any product candidate we may develop in the future 
if our product candidates are not considered cost effective or if we fail to generate adequate third party reimbursement for the users of our product candidates and treatments  then we may be unable to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment for product candidates currently in development  which could have an adverse impact on our business 
risks related to environmental and product liability our activities involve hazardous materials  and improper handling of these materials by our employees  contractors  or agents could expose us to significant legal and financial penalties 
our research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials  chemicals and various radioactive compounds 
as a consequence  we  our contractors and agents are subject to numerous environmental and safety laws and regulations  including those governing laboratory procedures  exposure to blood borne pathogens and the handling of biohazardous materials 
as an example  one of the components of grn  paclitaxel  is considered a cytotoxic agent  which makes the manufacturing of grn subject to additional regulations  and limits the number of manufacturing facilities in which grn can be made 
we  our contractors or agents may be required to incur significant costs to comply with current or future environmental laws and regulations and may be adversely affected by the cost of compliance with these laws and regulations 
although we believe that our safety procedures for using  handling  storing and disposing of hazardous materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations  the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated 
in the event of such an accident  state or federal authorities could curtail our use of these materials and we  our contractors or agents could be liable for any civil damages that result  the cost of which could be substantial 
further  any failure by us to control the use  disposal  removal or storage  or to adequately restrict the discharge  or assist in the clean up  of hazardous chemicals or hazardous  infectious or toxic substances could subject us to significant liabilities  including joint and several liability under certain statutes 
any such liability could exceed our resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  an accident could damage our research and manufacturing facilities and operations 
additional federal  state and local laws and regulations affecting us may be adopted in the future 
we  our contractors and agents may incur substantial costs to comply with these laws and regulations and substantial fines or penalties if we violate any of these laws or regulations  which would adversely affect our business 
we may not be able to obtain or maintain sufficient insurance on commercially reasonable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities in order to protect ourselves against product liability claims 
our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the testing  manufacturing and marketing of human therapeutic and diagnostic products 
we may become subject to product liability claims if the use of our product candidates is alleged to have injured subjects or patients 
this risk exists for our product candidates currently being tested in human clinical trials as well as product candidates that are sold commercially in the future 
we currently have limited clinical trial liability insurance and we may not be able to maintain this type of insurance for any of our clinical trials 
in addition  product liability insurance is becoming increasingly expensive 
being unable to obtain or maintain product liability insurance in the future on acceptable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents risks related to our common stock and financial reporting historically  our stock price has been extremely volatile 
stock prices and trading volumes for many biopharmaceutical companies fluctuate widely for a number of reasons  including factors which may be unrelated to their businesses or results of operations such as media coverage  legislative and regulatory measures and the activities of various interest groups or organizations 
this market volatility  as well as general domestic or international economic  market and political conditions  could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the return on your investment 
historically  our stock price has been extremely volatile 
between january  and december   our stock has traded as high as per share and as low as per share 
between january  and december   the price has ranged between a high of per share and a low of per share 
the significant market price fluctuations of our common stock are due to a variety of factors  including announcements regarding our clinical trial results  the demand in the market for our common stock  the experimental nature of our product candidates  fluctuations in our operating results  our declining cash balance as a result of operating losses  market conditions relating to the biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical industries  announcements of technological innovations  new commercial products  or clinical progress or lack thereof by us  our collaborative partners or our competitors  announcements concerning regulatory developments  developments with respect to proprietary rights and our collaborations  comments by securities analysts  general market conditions  the issuance of common stock to partners  vendors or to investors to raise additional capital  and the occurrence of any of those risks and uncertainties discussed in this item a  risk factors 
in addition  the stock market is subject to other factors outside our control that can cause extreme price and volume fluctuations 
since the latter half of  broad distress in the financial markets and the economy have resulted in greatly increased market uncertainty and instability in both us and international capital and credit markets 
these conditions  combined with foreign credit concerns  declining business and consumer confidence and high unemployment have recently contributed to substantial market volatility  and if such market conditions persist  the price of our common stock may fluctuate or decline 
we may be subject to litigation that will be costly to defend or pursue and uncertain in its outcome 
securities related class action litigation has often been brought against companies  including many biotechnology companies  which experience volatility in the market price of their securities 
this risk is especially relevant for us because biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies often experience significant stock price volatility in connection with their product development programs 
for example  after we announced the discontinuation of our stem cell business  our stock price declined 
further  if the results of our phase trials are not successful  or if we are unable to receive what stockholders believe to be adequate compensation for our stem cell assets  our stock price would likely decline  and may result in litigation 
securities related litigation may be filed in the future and a decision adverse to our interests in any such lawsuit could result in the payment of substantial damages by us  and could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow  results of operations and financial position 
our business may bring us into conflict with our licensees  licensors  or others with whom we have contractual or other business relationships  or with our competitors or others whose interests differ from ours 
if we are unable to resolve those conflicts on terms that are satisfactory to all parties  we may become involved in litigation brought 
table of contents by or against us 
monitoring and defending against legal actions is time consuming for our management  is likely to be expensive and may detract from our ability to fully focus our internal resources on our business activities 
the outcome of litigation is always uncertain  and in some cases could include judgments against us that require us to pay damages  enjoin us from certain activities  or otherwise affect our legal or contractual rights  which could have a significant adverse effect on our business 
in addition  the inherent uncertainty of such litigation could lead to increased volatility in our stock price 
the sale of a substantial number of shares may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that such sales could occur  could significantly and negatively affect the market price of our common stock 
as of december   we had  shares of common stock authorized for issuance and  shares of common stock outstanding 
in addition  as of december   we had reserved approximately  shares of common stock for future issuance pursuant to our option and equity incentive plans  potential milestone payments and outstanding warrants 
in addition  we have issued common stock to certain third parties  such as vendors and service providers  as payment for products and services 
under these arrangements  we have typically agreed to register the shares for resale soon after their issuance 
we may continue to pay for certain goods and services in this manner  which would dilute your interest in us 
also  sales of the shares issued in this manner could negatively affect the market price of our common stock 
future sales of the shares of the common stock  or the registration for sale of such common stock  or the issuance of common stock to satisfy our current or future cash payment obligations or to acquire technology  property  or other businesses  could cause immediate dilution and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
by way of example  in july we filed a universal shelf registration statement to sell any combination of debt securities  common stock  preferred stock and warrants in one or more offerings 
the cumulative value allowed to be sold of all securities under this universal shelf registration statement is limited to million and as of december   we have approximately million remaining available 
the sale or issuance of such stock  as well as the existence of outstanding options and shares of common stock reserved for issuance under our option and equity incentive plans  also may adversely affect the terms upon which we are able to obtain additional capital through the sale of equity securities 
our undesignated preferred stock may inhibit potential acquisition bids  this may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the voting rights of holders of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation provides our board of directors with the authority to issue up to  shares of undesignated preferred stock and to determine or alter the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions granted to or imported upon these shares without further vote or action by our stockholders 
the issuance of shares of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control transaction without further action by our stockholders 
as a result  the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected 
in addition  if we issue preferred stock in the future that has preference over our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon our liquidation  dissolution or winding up  or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock  the rights of holders of our common stock or the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected 
provisions in our charter  bylaws and delaware law may inhibit potential acquisition bids for us  which may prevent holders of our common stock from benefiting from what they believe may be the positive aspects of acquisitions and takeovers 
provisions of our charter documents and bylaws may make it substantially more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us and may prevent changes in our management  including provisions that prevent stockholders from taking actions by written consent  divide the board of directors into separate classes with terms of office that are structured to prevent all of the directors from being elected in any one year  and set forth procedures for nominating directors and submitting proposals for consideration at stockholders meetings 

table of contents provisions of delaware law may also inhibit potential acquisition bids for us or prevent us from engaging in business combinations 
in addition  we have severance agreements with several employees and a change of control severance plan which could require an acquiror to pay a higher price 
either collectively or individually  these provisions may prevent holders of our common stock from benefiting from what they may believe are the positive aspects of acquisitions and takeovers  including the potential realization of a higher rate of return on their investment from these types of transactions 
we do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
any payment of cash dividends will depend upon our financial condition  results of operations  capital requirements and other factors and will be at the discretion of our board of directors 
failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act requires that we establish and maintain an adequate internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting 
our annual report on form k must contain an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that we have identified 
in addition  our independent registered public accounting firm must annually provide an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act are ongoing and also apply to future years 
we expect that our internal control over financial reporting will continue to evolve as our business develops 
although we are committed to continue to improve our internal control processes and we will continue to diligently and vigorously review our internal control over financial reporting in order to ensure compliance with section requirements  any control system  regardless of how well designed  operated and evaluated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that its objectives will be met 
therefore  we cannot be certain that in the future material weaknesses or significant deficiencies will not exist or otherwise be discovered 
if material weaknesses or other significant deficiencies occur  these weaknesses or deficiencies could result in misstatements of our results of operations  restatements of our consolidated financial statements  a decline in our stock price  or other material adverse effects on our business  reputation  results of operations  financial condition or liquidity

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies  as defined below 
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
specifically  critical accounting estimates have the following attributes i we are required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate  and ii different estimates we could reasonably have used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known 
based on a critical assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  management believes that our consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and meaningfully present our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition since our inception  a substantial portion of our revenues has been generated from research and licensing agreements 
revenue under such agreements typically includes upfront signing or license fees  cost reimbursements  milestone payments and royalties on future product sales 
we recognize nonrefundable signing  license or non exclusive option fees as revenue when rights to use the intellectual property related to the license have been delivered and over the term of the agreement if we have continuing performance obligations 
we recognize milestone payments  which are subject to substantive contingencies  upon completion of specified milestones  which represents the culmination of an earnings process  according to contract terms 
royalties are generally recognized as revenue upon the receipt of the related royalty payment 
we recognize cost reimbursement revenue under collaborative agreements as the related research and development costs for services are rendered 
we recognize related party revenue under collaborative agreements as the related party research and development costs for services are rendered and when the source of funds has not been derived from our contributions to the related party 
deferred revenue represents the portion of research or license payments received which has not been earned 
when payments are received in equity securities  we do not recognize any revenue unless such securities are determined to be realizable in cash 
we estimate the projected future term of license agreements over which we recognize revenue 
our estimates are based on contractual terms  historical experience and general industry practice 
revisions in the estimated terms of these license agreements have the effect of increasing or decreasing license fee revenue in the period of revision 
as of december   no revisions to the estimated future terms of license agreements have been made and we do not expect revisions to the currently active agreements in the future 
valuation of stock based compensation we measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock based awards to our employees and directors  including stock options  restricted stock awards and employee stock purchases related to our employee stock purchase plan espp based on estimated fair values 
we use the black scholes option pricing valuation model to estimate the grant date fair value of our stock options and employee stock plan purchases 
option pricing model assumptions such as expected volatility  risk free interest rate and expected term impact the fair value estimate 

table of contents further  the estimated forfeiture rate impacts the amount of aggregate compensation recognized during the period 
the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchases is amortized over the vesting period of the awards using a straight line method 
expected volatilities are based on historical volatilities of our stock since traded options on geron stock do not correspond to option terms and trading volume of options is limited 
the expected term of options represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
in deriving this assumption  we reviewed actual historical exercise and cancellation data and the remaining outstanding options not yet exercised or cancelled 
the expected term of employees purchase rights  under our espp  is equal to the purchase period 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us zero coupon treasury strip yields for the expected term in effect on the date of grant 
forfeiture rate was estimated based on historical experience and will be adjusted over the requisite service period based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ  from their estimate 
we grant restricted stock awards to employees and non employee directors with three types of vesting schedules i service based  ii performance based or iii market based 
service based restricted stock awards rsas generally vest annually over four years 
performance based stock awards psas vest only upon achievement of discrete strategic goals within a specified performance period  generally three years 
market based stock awards msas vest only upon achievement of certain market price thresholds of our common stock within a specified performance period  generally three years 
the fair value for service based rsas is determined using the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant and reduced for estimated forfeitures  as applicable 
the fair value is amortized as compensation expense over the requisite service period of the award on a straight line basis 
the fair value for psas is determined using the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant and reduced for estimated forfeitures  as applicable 
compensation expense for psas is recognized over the period from the date the performance condition is determined to be probable of occurring through the date the applicable condition is expected to be met 
if the performance condition is not considered probable of being achieved  no expense is recognized until such time as the performance condition is considered probable of being met  if ever 
we evaluate whether performance conditions are probable of occurring  as well as the expected performance period  on a quarterly basis 
the fair value for msas is determined using a lattice valuation model with a monte carlo simulation 
the model takes into consideration the historical volatility of our stock and the risk free interest rate at the date of grant 
in addition  the model is used to estimate the derived service period for the msas 
the derived service period is the estimated period of time that would be required to satisfy the market condition  assuming the market condition will be satisfied 
compensation expense is recognized over the derived service period for the msas using the straight line method  but is accelerated if the market condition is achieved earlier than estimated 
we annually evaluate the assumptions used in estimating fair values of our stock based awards by reviewing current trends in comparison to historical data 
we have not revised the methods by which we derive assumptions in order to estimate fair values of our stock based awards 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in future periods  the stock based compensation expense that we record for awards to employees and directors may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
non cash compensation expense recognized for stock based awards to employees and directors was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as of december   total compensation cost related to unvested stock awards not yet recognized  net of estimated forfeitures and assuming no probability of achievement for outstanding psas  was million  which is expected to be recognized over the next months on a weighted average basis 
for our non employee stock based awards  the measurement date on which the fair value of the stock based award is calculated is equal to the earlier of i the date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instrument is reached or ii the date at which the counterparty s performance is complete 
we recognized non cash stock based compensation expense of   and  for the fair value of the vested portion of non employee options  restricted stock awards and warrants in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december   and  respectively 

table of contents fair value of financial instruments we categorize assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet based upon the level of judgment associated with inputs used to measure their fair value 
the categories are as follows level inputs are unadjusted  quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date 
an active market for the asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis 
level inputs other than quoted market prices included in level are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the measurement date and for the duration of the instrument s anticipated life 
level inputs reflect management s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date 
consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model 
a financial instrument s categorization is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet  including the category for such instruments 
we classify inputs to derive fair values for marketable debt securities available for sale and marketable investments in licensees as level and instruments classified as level include money market funds and certificates of deposit  representing of total financial assets measured at fair value as of december  instruments classified as level include us government sponsored enterprise securities  commercial paper and corporate notes  representing of total financial assets measured at fair value as of december  the price for each security at the measurement date is derived from various sources 
periodically  we assess the reasonableness of these sourced prices by comparing them to the prices provided by our portfolio managers from broker quotes as well as reviewing the pricing methodologies used by our portfolio managers 
historically  we have not experienced significant deviation between the sourced prices and our portfolio manager s prices 
warrants to purchase common stock and non employee options are normally traded less actively  have trade activity that is one way  and or traded in less developed markets and are therefore valued based upon models with significant unobservable market parameters  resulting in level categorization 
the fair value for these instruments is calculated using the black scholes option pricing model 
the model s inputs reflect assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the instrument in a current period transaction 
inputs to the model include stock volatility  dividend yields  expected term of the derivatives and risk free interest rates 
see the following discussion  fair value of derivatives  for information on the derivation of inputs to the model 
changes to the model s inputs are not changes to valuation methodologies  but instead reflect direct or indirect impacts from changes in market conditions 
accordingly  results from the valuation model in one period may not be indicative of future period measurements 
instruments classified as level include derivative liabilities  representing all of total financial liabilities measured at fair value as of december  for a further discussion regarding fair value measurements  see note on fair value measurements in notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
clinical trial accruals substantial portions of our preclinical studies and all of our clinical trials have been performed by third party contract research organizations  or cros  and other vendors 
we accrue expenses for preclinical studies performed by our vendors based on certain estimates over the term of the service period and adjust our estimates as required 
we accrue expenses for clinical trial activities performed by cros based upon the estimated amount of work completed on each study 
for clinical trial expenses  the significant factors used in estimating accruals include the number of patients enrolled  the number of active clinical sites  and the duration for which the patients will be enrolled in the study 
we monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible through internal reviews  review of contractual terms and correspondence with cros 
we base our estimates on the best information available at the time 
however  additional information may become available to us which will allow us to make a more accurate estimate in future periods 
in this event  we may be required to record adjustments to research and development expenses in future periods when the actual level of activity becomes more certain 

table of contents fair value of derivatives for warrants and non employee options classified as assets or liabilities  the fair value of these instruments is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at inception of such classification and marked to fair value at each financial reporting date 
the change in fair value of the warrants and non employee options is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as an unrealized gain loss on fair value of derivatives 
the warrants and non employee options continue to be reported as an asset or liability until such time as the instruments are exercised or expire or are otherwise modified to remove the provisions which require this treatment  at which time these instruments are marked to fair value and reclassified from assets or liabilities to stockholders equity 
for warrants and non employee options classified as permanent equity  the fair value of the warrants and non employee options is recorded in stockholders equity and no further adjustments are made 
fair value of warrants and non employee options is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
use of this model requires us to make assumptions regarding stock volatility  dividend yields  expected term of the warrants and non employee options and risk free interest rates 
expected volatilities are based on historical volatilities of our stock 
the expected term of warrants and non employee options represent the remaining contractual term of the instruments 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us zero coupon treasury strip yields for the remaining term of the instrument 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in future periods  the fair value of these warrants and non employee options reflected as of each balance sheet date and the resulting change in fair value that we record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in previous periods 
as of december   we have not revised the method in which we derive assumptions in order to estimate fair values of warrants and non employee options classified as assets or liabilities  and we do not expect revisions in the future 
consolidation and accounting for variable interest entities vies under applicable accounting guidance  an entity is considered to be a vie if it has one of the following characteristics i the entity is thinly capitalized  ii residual equity holders do not control the entity  iii equity holders are shielded from economic losses or do not participate fully in the entity s residual economics  or iv the entity was established with non substantive voting 
investors that finance a vie through debt or equity interests are variable interest holders in the entity 
since january   the variable interest holder  if any  exposed to the majority of the risks and rewards associated with a vie is considered the vie s primary beneficiary and must consolidate the entity 
we must evaluate our involvement in a vie and understand the purpose and design of the entity  the role we have in the entity s design and our involvement in its ongoing activities 
we then must evaluate which activities most significantly impact the economic performance of the vie and who has the power to direct such activities 
this evaluation involves a variety of qualitative and quantitative assumptions 
when we determine that we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact a vie s economic performance  we then must evaluate our economic interests  if any  and determine whether we could absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie 
when evaluating whether we have an obligation to absorb losses that could be potentially significant  we consider the maximum exposure to such loss without consideration of probability 
such obligations could be in various forms  including but not limited to  debt and equity investments  guarantees  liquidity agreements and certain derivative contracts 
as certain events occur  we reconsider which parties will absorb variability and whether we have become or are no longer the primary beneficiary 
the consolidation status of a vie may change as a result of such reconsideration events  which occur when vies acquire additional assets  issue new variable interests or enter into new or modified contractual arrangements 
a reconsideration event may also occur when we acquire new or additional interests in a vie

table of contents results of operations our results of operations have fluctuated from period to period and may continue to fluctuate in the future  based upon the progress of our research and development efforts and variations in the level of expenses related to developmental efforts during any given period 
results of operations for any period may be unrelated to results of operations for any other period 
in addition  historical results should not be viewed as indicative of future operating results 
we are subject to risks common to companies in our industry and at our stage of development  including risks inherent in our research and development efforts  reliance upon our collaborative partners  enforcement of our patent and proprietary rights  need for future capital  potential competition and uncertainty of preclinical and clinical trial results or regulatory approvals or clearances 
in order for a product candidate to be commercialized based on our research  we and our collaborators must conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials  demonstrate the efficacy and safety of our product candidates  obtain regulatory approvals or clearances and enter into manufacturing  distribution and marketing arrangements  as well as obtain market acceptance 
we do not expect to receive revenues or royalties based on therapeutic products for a period of years  if at all 
revenues we recognized  of revenues from collaborative agreements in compared to  in and  in revenues in  and primarily reflected revenue recognized under our collaboration with ge healthcare uk  ltd 
ge healthcare 
the collaboration with ge healthcare began in july and concluded in june we have entered into license and option agreements with companies involved with oncology  diagnostics  research tools  agriculture and biologics production 
in each of these agreements  we have granted certain rights to our technologies 
in connection with the agreements  we are entitled to receive license fees  option fees  milestone payments and royalties on future product sales  or any combination thereof 
we recognized license fee revenues of million  million and million in  and  respectively  related to our various agreements 
current revenues may not be predictive of future revenues 
we recognized royalty revenues of   and  in  and  respectively  on product sales of telomerase detection and telomere measurement kits to the research use only market  cell based research products and nutritional products 
license and royalty revenues are dependent upon additional agreements being signed and future product sales 
research and development expenses research and development expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in compared to was primarily the net result of increased clinical trial costs of million for the enrollment of four phase clinical trials of imetelstat and the phase clinical trial of grnopc and higher clinical drug product purchases and manufacturing costs of million related to imetelstat and grn  partially offset by reduced costs for scientific supplies of million primarily resulting from the discontinued development of our stem cell programs and lower non cash compensation expense in connection with equity based awards of  the increase in compared to was primarily the net result of higher clinical drug product purchases of million for imetelstat  increased clinical trial costs of million as a result of opening four phase clinical trials of imetelstat and reinitiating the phase clinical trial of grnopc and higher non cash compensation expense in connection with equity based awards of million  partially offset by reduced contract manufacturing costs of million primarily resulting from completion of patient enrollment in our phase clinical trial of grnvac overall  we expect research and development expenses to decrease as a result of our decision to focus exclusively on the development of our oncology programs and discontinue further development of our stem cell programs 

table of contents using innovative technologies and unique approaches  we are developing novel therapeutics to treat cancer 
the following table briefly describes our current clinical development product candidates and their stage of development as of december  
geron kxxjpg 
imetelstat  a potent and specific inhibitor of telomerase  is the product of geron s internal research and development capability  including pioneering work in telomerase and its role in cell proliferation 
expression and activity of telomerase are increased in bulk tumor cells and cancer progenitor cells in a broad range of cancer types 
we are evaluating imetelstat in two randomized  controlled phase trials in solid tumors  one in metastatic breast cancer and the other in advanced non small cell lung cancer nsclc 
both are diseases in which the prognosis for patients remains poor  and there is evidence that disease progression  relapse and metastasis are driven in part by cancer progenitor cells 
we are also studying imetelstat in two single arm phase trials in hematologic blood based cancers  one in essential thrombocythemia and the other in multiple myeloma  where the effect of the drug on the malignant progenitor cells responsible for the disease can be more directly observed than is the case in solid tumors 
we expect to have top line data from our phase trials of imetelstat by the end of grn is a peptide drug conjugate designed to utilize a physiologic molecular transport mechanism known as lipoprotein receptor related protein  or lrp  to deliver paclitaxel across the blood brain barrier bbb and into tumors in the brain 
the bbb prevents most drugs  including oncology drugs  from reaching the brain at levels that are clinically effective 
grn is designed to overcome this challenge by linking paclitaxel to a proprietary peptide  angiopep  that is actively transported across the bbb by lrp angiopep also facilitates uptake of the conjugate into tumor cells inside and outside the brain 
the bond linking angiopep peptide and paclitaxel is cleaved when it is taken up into cells  including tumor cells both inside and outside the brain  releasing active paclitaxel 
grn was in licensed from angiochem in on an exclusive basis under a conventional milestone and royalty structure 
we are conducting two single arm phase trials  one in patients with brain metastases associated with breast cancer and the other in brain metastases associated with non small cell lung cancer 
we selected these indications because in phase trials clinical activity was observed in patients with these tumor types 
we expect to have top line data from these two phase trials of grn by the end of the second quarter of in november  we announced that we will exclusively focus on our oncology programs and consequently  we discontinued development of our stem cell programs 
we continue to accrue data on the patients already enrolled in the phase trial of grnopc for spinal cord injury 
we intend to divest our stem cell programs in  which include grnopc for spinal cord injury  currently in a phase clinical trial  as well as programs in cardiomyocytes for heart disease  pancreatic islet cells for diabetes  dendritic cells as an immunotherapy vehicle and chondrocytes for cartilage repair 

table of contents research and development expenses incurred under our programs were as follows in thousands year ended december  oncology    hesc therapies    total    at this time  we cannot provide reliable estimates of how much time or investment will be necessary to commercialize products from the programs currently in progress 
for a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing development of our product candidates  see the sub sections titled risks related to our business and risks related to clinical and commercialization activities in part i  item a entitled risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
acquired in process research and development as consideration for the license rights to angiochem s proprietary peptide technology for the clinical development of ang now grn  we paid angiochem an upfront payment of million in cash in december and on january   issued  shares of common stock to angiochem as payment of our obligation to issue million in stock 
further clinical and process development of grn is required before any viable commercial application can be identified or utilized 
we have concluded that this technology has no alternative future use  and accordingly  expensed the total upfront payment of million in connection with the license agreement as acquired in process research and development expense at the time of acquisition 
see note on license agreements in notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for further discussion of the exclusive license agreement with angiochem 
restructuring charges on november   we announced the decision to focus exclusively on the development of our oncology programs and consequently  we discontinued further development of our stem cell programs 
with this decision  a total of full time positions were eliminated  of which as of february   employees are continuing to provide services and are discontinuing employment with us through various dates in the first half of in connection with the restructuring  we recorded aggregate restructuring charges of approximately million  of which million related to one time termination benefits  including  of non cash stock based compensation expense relating to the extension of the post termination exercise period for certain stock options previously granted to terminated employees to june  and december   and  related to write downs of excess lab equipment and leasehold improvements and other charges 
we may incur additional charges as a result of the restructuring as we exit one of the three buildings in which we lease space in menlo park  california  which will be recorded as they are determined 
we also plan to sell any excess equipment  the net proceeds of which may offset some of these future charges 
we expect the restructuring will result in aggregate cash expenditures of approximately million  of which  related to one time termination benefits was paid as of december  and approximately million related to one time termination benefits is expected to be paid during without the restructuring  we estimated that we would have incurred approximately million in research and development expenses in connection with our stem cell programs in see note on restructuring in notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for further discussion of the restructuring charges 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in from was primarily the result of higher non cash stock based compensation expense of million related to stock options and restricted stock awards to employees  severance expenses of million related to separation agreements executed with our former chief executive officer ceo and chief financial officer cfo and higher corporate legal and consulting fees of million 
the increase in from was primarily due to higher non cash stock based compensation expense of million related to stock options and restricted stock awards to employees  increased consulting and legal costs of  and higher costs associated with managing our intellectual property portfolio of 
table of contents unrealized gain on fair value of derivatives unrealized gain on fair value of derivatives reflects a non cash adjustment for changes in fair value of warrants to purchase common stock and options held by non employees that are classified as current liabilities 
derivatives classified as assets or liabilities are marked to fair value at each financial reporting date with any resulting unrealized gain loss recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
the derivatives continue to be reported as an asset or liability until such time as the instruments are exercised or expire or are otherwise modified to remove the provisions which require them to be recorded as assets or liabilities  at which time these instruments are marked to fair value and reclassified from assets or liabilities to stockholders equity 
we incurred unrealized gains of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the unrealized gains on derivatives for  and primarily reflect reduced fair values of derivative liabilities resulting from shortening of their contractual terms  decreases in the market value of our stock and changes in other inputs factored into the estimate of their fair value such as the volatility of our stock 
see note on fair value measurements in notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for further discussion of the fair value of derivatives 
interest and other income interest income was million   and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in interest income in compared to was due to higher cash and investment balances for the majority of as a result of the receipt of million in net proceeds in december from an underwritten public offering of our common stock 
the decrease in interest income in compared to was primarily the result of lower cash and investment balances for the majority of interest earned in future periods will depend on the size of our securities portfolio and prevailing interest rates 
other income was zero  million and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in november  geron received a total of million in grants under the qualifying therapeutic discovery project qtdp program 
the maximum grant amount was awarded to each of the five geron programs that were eligible for qtdp funding and included oncology and human embryonic stem cell projects 
other income in primarily represented tax refunds for certain research tax credits under the housing assistance tax act of resulting from our election to forego bonus depreciation with respect to investments in bonus eligible property during losses recognized under equity method investment we own of viagen  inc viagen  a licensee with in house breeding services and expertise in advanced reproductive technologies for animal cloning 
in september  we provided a loan of million to viagen in connection with viagen s acquisition of an interest in an unrelated company 
the proceeds of the loan did not fund prior viagen losses and represented additional financial support to viagen 
in september  we provided million as a new equity investment in viagen and also received million from viagen in repayment of our loan  resulting in a net investment of million 
the new investment in did not fund prior viagen losses and represented additional financial support to viagen 
in november  we provided a new loan of million to viagen to fund its operations 
the loan represented additional financial support to viagen and funded approximately  in prior losses of the company which has been included in losses recognized under equity method investment in in accordance with the equity method of accounting  we recognized losses of  million and million for  and  respectively  for our proportionate share of viagen s losses since providing the loan in september as of june   we suspended the equity method of accounting for viagen since our proportionate share of net losses exceeded the value of our investment 
since viagen does not have sufficient equity to finance its own activities without additional subordinated financial support  it meets the definition of a variable interest entity vie 
by providing financial support to viagen  we are a variable interest holder 
however  the party holding the majority of the equity and debt of viagen maintains controlling financial interest over the company and we do not have the power to direct the activities of viagen 
accordingly  we are not the primary beneficiary and have not included viagen s financial information with our consolidated results 
see note on joint venture and related party transactions in notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for further discussion of our investment in viagen 

table of contents losses recognized from debt extinguishment on november   we repaid the outstanding principal balance  including accrued interest  or loan balance  to the california institute for regenerative medicine cirm  representing our entire loan balance under our loan agreement from cirm 
in addition  we relinquished our right to future disbursements from cirm under the loan agreement and gave notice of termination 
with the repayment of the entire outstanding loan balance  we have no further amounts owed to cirm 
in connection with the early termination of the cirm loan agreement  we recognized a debt extinguishment charge of million for the unamortized debt discount associated with the loan 
see note on long term debt in notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for a further discussion of the cirm loan 
interest and other expense interest and other expense was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in interest and other expense for compared to primarily reflects  in interest expense resulting from the amortization of the debt discount and accrual of interest on the cirm loan and increased bank charges as a result of higher cash and investment balances for the majority of the decrease in interest and other expense for compared to was primarily due to reduced bank charges as a result of lower cash and investment balances for the majority of deemed dividend on derivatives in april  we modified the terms of certain outstanding warrants held by an investor by extending the exercise term and  for certain of these warrants  reducing the exercise price 
in connection with the modifications  we recognized a deemed dividend of approximately  for the incremental fair value of the modified warrants  as calculated using the black scholes option pricing model as of the modification date 
net loss applicable to common stockholders net loss applicable to common stockholders was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
overall net loss for decreased compared to primarily due to recognition of acquired in process research and development expense related to the in license from angiochem in december  partially offset by increased research and development expenses resulting from costs incurred to support the initiation and enrollment of our phase clinical trials of imetelstat and grn and phase clinical trial of grnopc  higher general and administrative expenses related to non cash stock based compensation expense and severance expense for our former ceo and cfo and charges incurred for the november restructuring and early termination of the cirm loan agreement 
overall net loss for increased compared to primarily due to recognition of acquired in process research and development expense related to the in license from angiochem in december and increased research and development expenses resulting from costs incurred to support the initiation and enrollment of our phase clinical trials of imetelstat and phase clinical trial of grnopc liquidity and capital resources cash  restricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  were million  compared to million at december  and million at december  we have an investment policy to invest these funds in liquid  investment grade securities  such as interest bearing money market funds  certificates of deposit  municipal securities  us government and agency securities  corporate notes  commercial paper and asset backed securities 
our investment portfolio does not contain securities with exposure to sub prime mortgages  collateralized debt obligations or auction rate securities and  to date  we have not recognized an other than temporary impairment on our marketable securities or any significant changes in aggregate fair value that would impact our cash resources or liquidity 
to date  we have not experienced lack of access to our invested cash and cash equivalents  however  we cannot provide assurances that access to our invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 
the decrease in cash  restricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in was the result of cash being used for operations 
the increase in cash  restricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in was the net result of the receipt of million in net proceeds in december from an underwritten public offering of our common stock and the receipt of million in net proceeds in january from the sale of shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase additional shares of our common stock to institutional investors  partially offset by the use of cash for operations 

table of contents we estimate that our existing capital resources  interest income and amounts available to us under our equipment financing facility will be sufficient to fund our current level of operations through at least the next months 
however  our future capital requirements will be substantial 
changes in our research and development plans or other changes affecting our operating expenses or cash balances may result in the unexpected expenditure of available resources 
factors that may require us to use our available capital resources sooner than we anticipate include the accuracy of the assumptions underlying our estimates for our capital needs for and beyond  changes in our clinical development plans for our product candidates  imetelstat and grn  our ability to meaningfully reduce manufacturing costs of current product candidates  the magnitude and scope of our research and development programs  including the number and type of product candidates we intend to pursue  the progress we make in our research and development programs  preclinical development and clinical trials  our ability to establish  enforce and maintain strategic arrangements for research  development  clinical testing  manufacturing and marketing  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals and clearances  and the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims 
if our capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements  we will need to raise additional capital to fund our operations 
we anticipate that we would need to seek additional funding through strategic collaborations  public or private equity financings  equipment loans or other financing sources that may be available 
however  we may be unable to raise sufficient additional capital when we need it  on favorable terms or at all 
our ability to raise additional funds may be severely impaired if any of our product candidates fails to show adequate safety or efficacy in clinical testing 
if we are unable to obtain adequate funds on reasonable terms  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or obtain funds by entering into financing  supply or collaboration agreements on unattractive terms or we may be required to relinquish rights to technology or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that are unfavorable to us 
cash flows from operating activities net cash used in operations was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in net cash used in operations in compared to was primarily the result of increased research and development expenses associated with our clinical operations and reduced issuances of our common stock in exchange for research and development services 
the increase in net cash used in operations in compared to was primarily the result of increased research and development expenses associated with our clinical operations and reduced interest income 
cash flows from investing activities net cash provided by investing activities was million in net cash used in investing activities was million and million for and  respectively 
the change in cash flows from investing activities in compared to and compared to was primarily the result of lower purchases of marketable securities and higher marketable securities maturities in those respective years 
for the three years ended december   we have purchased approximately million in property and equipment  net of disposals  none of which was financed through equipment financing arrangements 
as of december   no payments were due under our equipment financing facility 
as of december   we had approximately  available for borrowing under our equipment financing facility 
if we are unable to renew the commitment  we will use our cash resources for capital expenditures

net cash provided by financing activities in primarily reflected receipt of approximately million in net proceeds from an underwritten public offering of  shares of our common stock at a public offering price of per share after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses and receipt of net proceeds of million from the sale of  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase an additional  shares of our common stock with an exercise price of per share to certain institutional investors 
significant cash and contractual obligations as of december  our contractual obligations for the next five years  and thereafter were as follows principal payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands equipment lease operating leases research funding   total contractual cash obligations   this table does not include any milestone payments under research collaborations or license agreements as the timing and likelihood of such payments are not known 
in addition  this table does not include payments under our severance plan if there were a change in control of geron or severance payments to key employees under involuntary termination 
in march  we issued  shares of our common stock to the lessor of our premises at and constitution drive in payment of our monthly rental obligation from august  through july  in january and april  we issued an aggregate of  shares of our common stock to the lessor of our premises at commonwealth drive in payment of our monthly rental obligation from may  through july  the fair value of the common stock issuances has been recorded as a prepaid asset and is being amortized to rent expense on a straight line basis over the lease periods 
future minimum payments under non cancelable operating leases are zero through july   as a result of the prepayments of rent with our common stock

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures contains forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
credit risk 
we place our cash  restricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities with six financial institutions in the united states and scotland 
deposits with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits 
while we monitor the cash balances in our operating accounts and adjust the cash balances as appropriate  these cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or could be subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets 
financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and marketable securities 
cash equivalents and marketable securities currently consist of money market funds  certificates of deposit  us government sponsored 
table of contents enterprise securities  commercial paper and corporate notes 
our investment policy  approved by our board of directors  limits the amount we may invest in any one type of investment issuer  thereby reducing credit risk concentrations 
we limit our credit and liquidity risks through our investment policy and through regular reviews of our portfolio against our policy 
to date  we have not experienced any loss or lack of access to cash in our operating accounts or to our cash equivalents and marketable securities in our investment portfolio 
interest rate risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to manage our marketable securities portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in widely diversified investments consisting of both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments  which both carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future interest income may fall short of expectations due to changes in market conditions and in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which may have declined in fair value due to changes in interest rates 
the fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  was million 
these investments include million of cash equivalents which are due in less than days  million of short term investments which are due in less than one year and million of long term investments which are due in one to two years 
we primarily invest our marketable securities portfolio in securities with at least an investment grade rating to minimize interest rate and credit risk as well as to provide for an immediate source of funds 
although changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of the marketable securities portfolio and cause unrealized gains or losses  such gains or losses would not be realized unless the investments are sold 
due to the nature of our investments  which are primarily money market funds  certificates of deposit  us government sponsored enterprise securities  commercial paper and corporate notes  we have concluded that there is no material interest rate risk exposure 
foreign currency exchange risk 
because we translate foreign currencies into us dollars for reporting purposes  currency fluctuations can have an impact  though generally immaterial  on our operating results 
we believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is insignificant primarily because our wholly owned international subsidiary  geron bio med ltd  satisfies its financial obligations almost exclusively in its local currency 
as of december   there was an immaterial currency exchange impact from our intercompany transactions 
as of december   we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities
