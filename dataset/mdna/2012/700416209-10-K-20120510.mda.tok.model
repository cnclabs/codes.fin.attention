item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general park electrochemical corp 
park or the company is a global advanced materials company which develops  manufactures  markets and sells high technology digital and rf microwave printed circuit materials products principally for the telecommunications and internet infrastructure and high end computing markets and advanced composite materials  parts and assemblies products for the aerospace markets 
park s core capabilities are in the areas of polymer chemistry formulation and coating technology 
the company s manufacturing facilities are located in singapore  china  france  connecticut  kansas  arizona and california 
the company also maintains research and development facilities in arizona  kansas and singapore 
the company s total net sales worldwide declined in the fiscal year ended february  compared to the fiscal year ended february  principally as a result of decreases in net sales of the company s printed circuit materials products in north america and asia  following an increase in the company s total net sales in the fiscal year ended february  compared to the fiscal year ended february  as a result of increases in sales of the company s printed circuit materials products in north america  asia and europe 
the decrease in net sales of the company s printed circuit materials products in the fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year and the increase in net sales of the company s printed circuit materials products in the fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year were both accompanied by increases in sales of the company s aerospace composite materials  parts and assemblies products compared to the prior fiscal year 
the company s total net sales of its aerospace composite materials  parts and assemblies products increased to million in the fiscal year from million in the fiscal year and comprised and  respectively  of the company s total net sales worldwide in the and fiscal years 
as a result of the decrease in the company s total net sales in the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year  the company s earnings from operations in the fiscal year were lower than in the fiscal year as the company s gross profit margin  measured as a percentage of sales  declined to in the fiscal year compared to in the fiscal year 
the company s earnings from operations in the fiscal year were also adversely affected by the additional  and in some instances duplicative  costs associated with transferring aerospace composite materials  parts and assemblies manufacturing from the company s park advanced composite materials  inc pacm business unit in waterbury  connecticut and park aerospace structures corp 
pasc business unit in lynnwood  washington to the company s park aerospace technologies corp 
patc business unit in newton  kansas  higher utility costs and the company s donation to the japanese red cross society after the march earthquake in japan 
such negative factors were only partially offset by the benefits from the higher percentage of sales of higher margin  high performance printed circuit materials products in the fiscal year than in the fiscal year and by lower legal fees and expenses in the fiscal year than in the fiscal year 
the company s earnings from operations and net earnings in the fiscal year were also reduced by the pre tax charge of million recorded by the company in the fiscal year fourth quarter in connection with the closing of its pacm business unit located in waterbury  connecticut 
in the fiscal year second quarter  the company recognized a pre tax gain of million resulting from the settlement of a lawsuit for an insurance claim for business interruption at the company s neltec  inc business unit in tempe  arizona in the fiscal year caused by the explosion and resulting destruction of a treater at the company s business unit in singapore and the settlement of a lawsuit pertaining to defective equipment purchased by the company s patc business unit in newton  kansas 
the company s net earnings in the fiscal year were lower than in the fiscal year primarily as a result of the lower earnings from operations in the fiscal year than in the fiscal year  which were only partially offset by the litigation settlement gain  described above  realized by the company in the fiscal year and the lower income tax provision in the fiscal year than in the fiscal year 
the increase in the company s total net sales in the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year resulted in higher earnings from operations in the fiscal year than in the fiscal year  as the company s gross profit margin  measured as a percentage of sales  improved to in the fiscal year compared to in the fiscal year 
the company s operating and earnings performance during the fiscal year also benefited from the higher percentage of sales of higher margin  high performance printed circuit materials during the fiscal year 
however  the company s operating and earnings performances were adversely affected by losses incurred at the company s patc business unit in newton  kansas in the fiscal year as well as in the fiscal year 
the company s earnings from operations in the fiscal year were also reduced by the pre tax charge of million recorded by the company in the three month period ended november  related to the closure  in january of  of the operations of neltec europe sas  the company s digital electronic materials business unit located in mirebeau  france 
the company s net earnings in the fiscal year were substantially higher than its net earnings in the fiscal year as a result of the company s strong operating performance in the fiscal year and despite the aforementioned million charge and despite the higher income tax provision in the fiscal year than in the fiscal year 
the company s net earnings for the fiscal year were impacted by a tax benefit of million for the reduction of certain deferred tax liabilities in singapore related to a temporary tax incentive for offshore interest repatriation and by a charge of million of additional tax reserves in the united states  both recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 
such earnings were also impacted by a million tax benefit primarily for a retroactive extension of a development and expansion tax incentive in singapore  recorded in the third quarter of the fiscal year 
the markets in north america  asia and europe for the company s printed circuit materials products strengthened in the fiscal year third and fourth quarters after prevailing weakness in the fiscal year first and second quarters  and such strength continued in the fiscal year but dissipated in the fiscal year 
the markets for the company s advanced composite materials  parts and assemblies products were weak during the fiscal year but showed some small signs of improvement during the and fiscal years 
the global markets for the company s printed circuit materials products continue to be very difficult to forecast  and it is not clear to the company what the condition of the global markets for the company s printed circuit materials products will be in the fiscal year 
further  the company is not able to predict the impact the current global economic and financial conditions will have on the markets for its aerospace composite materials  parts and assemblies products in the fiscal year 
in the fiscal year third quarter  the company completed a major expansion of its aerospace composite materials development and manufacturing facility in kansas in order to manufacture aerospace composite parts and assemblies 
the expansion includes approximately  square feet of manufacturing and storage space  and the company spent approximately million on the facility expansion and equipment 
while the company continues to invest in its business  it also has made adjustments to certain of its operations  which resulted in workforce reductions and plant closures 
in the fiscal year fourth quarter  the company announced that its pacm facility  located in waterbury  connecticut  would be closing its operations after the completion of the transfer of pacm s aerospace composite materials manufacturing activities to the company s patc facility located at the newton  kansas airport 
the company expects such transfer to be completed in the second quarter of the fiscal year 
such transfer of aerospace composite materials manufacturing activities from the company s pacm facility to its patc facility  together with the transfer of aerospace composite parts and assemblies manufacturing activities from the company s pasc facility in lynnwood  washington to its patc facility  which was completed in the fiscal year fourth quarter  will complete the company s plan to concentrate and consolidate all of its north american aerospace composite materials  parts and assemblies manufacturing  development and design activities at its patc facility 
the completion of the consolidation of the company s aerospace composite materials  parts and assemblies manufacturing activities will eliminate the additional  and in some cases duplicative  costs which the company has incurred in connection with the start up of patc and the transfer of such manufacturing activities from pacm and pasc to patc 
in the fiscal year fourth quarter  the company reported that  as the result of this closure  it expected to record total pre tax restructuring charges of approximately million and that it expected to record approximately half of such charges in the fiscal year fourth quarter and to record the balance of such charges during the fiscal year  and the company stated that after the closure is completed  the pacm business operations will have no further impact on the consolidated financial condition or results of operations of the company 
the company recorded a pre tax charge of million in the fiscal year fourth quarter in connection with such closure and now expects to record a pre tax charge of million during the fiscal year and no further charge in connection with such closure 
the company recorded a pre tax charge of million in the fiscal year related to the closure  in january of  of the operations of neltec europe sas  the company s printed circuit materials business unit located in mirebeau  france 
the company previously recorded a pre tax charge of million in connection with such closure in the fiscal year ended march  the additional charge in the fiscal year was based on updated estimates of the total costs to complete the closure of the neltec europe sas business unit as a result of additional information regarding such costs  including recent developments relating to certain employment litigation initiated in france after the closure and other expenses in excess of the original estimates 
the closure of neltec europe sas in january of was a major component of restructurings of the operations of the company s neltec europe sas and neltec sa business units in the fiscal year in response to the continuing serious erosion of the markets for printed circuit materials in europe and the continuing migration of such markets to asia 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year the company s total net sales worldwide decreased in the fiscal year ended february  compared to the fiscal year ended february  principally as a result of decreases in net sales of the company s printed circuit materials products in north america and asia  which were only partially offset by a small increase in net sales of such products in europe and by an increase in net sales of the company s aerospace composite materials  parts and assemblies products 
the company s gross profit and its gross profit margin declined in the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year 
the gross profit margin declined to in the fiscal year compared to in the fiscal year primarily as a result of the decline in sales  increased utility costs  additional  and in some instances duplicative  costs associated with the consolidation of all of the company s north american aerospace composite materials  parts and assemblies manufacturing  development and design activities at its patc business unit in newton  kansas  and the partially fixed nature of the company s overhead costs 
such factors were only partially offset by the benefits from the higher percentage of sales of higher margin  high performance printed circuit materials products in the fiscal year than in the fiscal year 
the company s earnings from operations in the fiscal year were adversely affected by the aforementioned lower gross profit margins  by higher selling  general and administrative expenses in such year compared to the prior year and by the aforementioned million charge in connection with the closure of pacm and were lower than the company s earnings from operations in such prior year 
the company s earnings from operations in the prior year were adversely affected by the pre tax charge of million recorded by the company in such year related to the closure  in january of  of the operations of neltec europe sas  the company s printed circuit materials business unit located in mirebeau  france 
although the company s net earnings in the fiscal year benefited from a significantly lower income tax provision than in the prior year and from the gain resulting from the settlement of two lawsuits  such net earnings were adversely affected by the lower earnings from operations and  consequently  were lower than the company s net earnings in the fiscal year 
the company s higher net earnings in the fiscal year were the result of the higher earnings from operations despite the adverse effects of the charge related to the closure of neltec europe sas and the higher income tax provision in the fiscal year than in the fiscal year 
the company s earnings from operations and net earnings in both the and fiscal years were reduced by losses incurred at the company s patc business unit in newton  kansas

the company s gross profit in the fiscal year was lower than its gross profit in the prior fiscal year  and the overall gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the company s worldwide operations declined to in the fiscal year compared to in the fiscal year 
the decrease in the gross profit margin was attributable to the lower total net sales in the fiscal year and the higher cost of sales relative to total sales in such year than in the prior year 
such factors were only partially offset by the higher percentage of sales of higher margin  high performance printed circuit materials products in the fiscal year than in the fiscal year 
during the fiscal year ended february   of the company s total net sales worldwide of printed circuit materials consisted of high performance printed circuit materials  compared to for the fiscal year 
the company s high performance printed circuit materials non fr printed circuit materials include high speed  low loss materials for digital and rf microwave applications requiring lead free compatibility and high bandwidth signal integrity  bismalimide triazine bt materials  polyimides for applications that demand extremely high thermal performance and reliability  cyanate esters  quartz reinforced materials  and polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe and modified epoxy materials for rf microwave systems that operate at frequencies up to ghz 
the company s cost of sales decreased by in the fiscal year from the fiscal year as a result of lower sales and lower production volumes in the fiscal year than in the fiscal year  but the company s cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased to in the fiscal year from in the fiscal year resulting in a gross profit margin decline from to 
the company s cost of sales in the fiscal year was inflated by increased utility costs and additional  and in some instances duplicative  costs associated with the consolidation of all of the company s north american aerospace composite materials  parts and assemblies manufacturing  development and design activities at its patc business unit 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or by  during the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year  and these expenses  measured as percentages of sales  were during the fiscal year compared to during the fiscal year

during the fiscal year  the company expended approximately million for equipment for such expanded facility 
at february  and february   the company had no long term debt 
the company believes its financial resources will be sufficient  for the foreseeable future  to provide for continued investment in working capital and property  plant and equipment and for general corporate purposes 
such resources would also be available for purchases of the company s common stock  appropriate acquisitions and other expansions of the company s business 
the company is not aware of any circumstances or events that are reasonably likely to occur that could materially affect its liquidity 
the company s contractual obligations and other commercial commitments to make future payments under contracts  such as lease agreements  consist only of the operating lease commitments  commitments to purchase equipment for the company s printed circuit materials manufacturing facility in singapore and to purchase equipment for the expansion of the company s aerospace development and manufacturing facility described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report and the company s obligation to pay up to an additional million over two years in connection with the acquisition of the assets and business of nova composites  inc  described above

a reasonable estimate of timing of these liabilities is not possible 
off balance sheet arrangements the company s liquidity is not dependent on the use of  and the company is not engaged in  any off balance sheet financing arrangements  such as securitization of receivables or obtaining access to assets through special purpose entities 
environmental matters the company is subject to various federal  state and local government and foreign government requirements relating to the protection of the environment 
the company believes that  as a general matter  its policies  practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and that its handling  manufacture  use and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances are in accord with environmental laws and regulations 
however  mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies  which were generally in compliance with applicable laws at the time of the operations in question  the company  like other companies engaged in similar businesses  is a party to claims by government agencies and third parties and has incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs associated with environmental matters 
additional claims and costs involving past environmental matters may continue to arise in the future 
it is the company s policy to record appropriate liabilities for such matters when remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
while annual environmental remedial response and voluntary cleanup expenditures have generally been constant from year to year  and may increase over time  the company expects it will be able to fund such expenditures from cash flow from operations 
the timing of expenditures depends on a number of factors  including regulatory approval of cleanup projects  remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties 
management does not expect that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the liquidity  capital resources  business  consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial position of the company

the company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors  including the length of time accounts receivable are past due  the company s previous loss history  the customer s current ability to pay its obligation to the company  and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required

inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market

valuation of long lived assets the company assesses the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable

income taxes as part of the processes of preparing its consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate the income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the company s consolidated statement of operations  or conversely to further reduce the existing valuation allowance resulting in less income tax expense 
the company evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and assesses the need for additional valuation allowances quarterly 
tax benefits are recognized for an uncertain tax position when  in the company s judgment  it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority 
for a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold  the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount that is judged to have a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority 
the liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances and when new information becomes available 
such adjustments are recognized entirely in the period in which they are identified 
the effective tax rate includes the net impact of changes in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and subsequent adjustments as considered appropriate by the company 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter  the company believes its liability for unrecognized tax benefits is adequate 
interest and penalties recognized on the liability for unrecognized tax benefits are recorded as income tax expense
