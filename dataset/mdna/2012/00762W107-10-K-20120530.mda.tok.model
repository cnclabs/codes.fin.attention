item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we provide best practices research and analysis  software tools  and management and advisory services through discrete programs to approximately  organizations  including hospitals  health systems  pharmaceutical and biotech companies  health care insurers  medical device companies  colleges  universities  and other educational institutions 
members of each program typically are charged a fixed fee and have access to an integrated set of services that may include best practice research studies  executive education seminars  customized research briefs  web based access to the program s content database  and software tools 
our membership business model allows us to create value for our members by providing proven technology solutions to common and complex problems as well as high quality content on a broad set of relevant issues 
our growth has been driven by strong renewal rates  addition of new memberships in our existing programs  new program launches  acquisitions of complementary businesses  and annual price increases 
our member institution renewal rate was   and for fiscal   and  respectively 
we believe that high renewal rates are a reflection of our members recognition of the value they derive from participating in our programs 
our revenue grew in fiscal over fiscal and grew in fiscal over fiscal our contract value increased to million as of march  from march  and increased to million as of march  from march  we define contract value as the aggregate annualized revenue attributed to all agreements in effect at a particular date  without regard to the initial term or remaining duration of any such agreement 
as of march   more than of our contract value was renewable 
in each of our programs  we generally invoice and collect fees in advance of accrual revenue recognition 
our operating costs and expenses consist of cost of services  member relations and marketing  general and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization of property and equipment expenses  and  in fiscal  the write off of capitalized software 
cost of services includes the costs associated with the production and delivery of our products and services  consisting of compensation for research personnel  in house faculty  software developers  and consultants  the organization and delivery of membership meetings  teleconferences  and other events  production of published materials  technology license fees  costs of developing and supporting our web based content and software tools  and fair value adjustments to acquisition related earn out liabilities

write off of capitalized software in fiscal includes the impairment charge taken to write down internally developed capitalized software balances to their current fair value 
our operating costs for each period presented include stock based compensation expense and expenses that represent additional payroll taxes associated with the taxable income recognized by employees upon their exercise of common stock options and the vesting of their restricted stock units issued under our stock incentive plans 

table of contents non gaap financial presentation this management s discussion and analysis presents supplemental measures of our performance which are derived from our consolidated financial information but which are not presented in our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
these financial measures  which are considered non gaap financial measures under sec rules  are referred to as adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income  and non gaap earnings per diluted share 
see non gaap financial measures below for information about our use of these non gaap financial measures  including our reasons for including these measures  material limitations with respect to the usefulness of the measures  and reconciliations of each non gaap financial measure to the most directly comparable gaap financial measure 
results of operations the following table shows statements of income data expressed as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated year ended march  revenue costs and expenses cost of services member relations and marketing general and administrative depreciation and amortization of property and equipment write off of capitalized software total costs and expenses operating income other income  net income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes and equity in loss of unconsolidated entity provision for income taxes equity in loss of unconsolidated entity net income from continuing operations discontinued operations loss income from discontinued operations  net of tax gain on sale of discontinued operations  net of tax net loss income from discontinued operations net income fiscal years ended march    and net income 
net income increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  and to million in fiscal the increase in net income in fiscal was primarily attributable to increased revenue and  to a lesser extent  to the absence of two non cash charges incurred in fiscal  and was partially offset by costs associated with the launch of new programs and an increase in the number of new sales teams 
during fiscal  we incurred a non cash charge of million resulting from the write off of capitalized software and a non cash charge of million associated with the cancellation of stock options voluntarily surrendered by certain members of senior management and the board of directors 
the increase in net income in fiscal was primarily due to a increase in revenue and a gain on the sale of discontinued operations of million  net of taxes 
the effect of these factors was partially offset by increases of million in cost of services due to newly developed  acquired and growing programs  increases of million in marketing and member relations expense due to the addition of new sales teams  and increases of million in general and administrative expense related to increased new product development costs and increases in finance  information technology  and human resources expense incurred to support our growing employee base 
our fiscal results include our proportionate share of the net loss of evolent health  inc  or evolent  a venture we established in the second quarter of fiscal adjusted net income  non gaap earnings per diluted share  and adjusted ebitda 
adjusted net income increased from million  or per diluted share  in fiscal to million  or per diluted share  in fiscal  and to million  or per diluted share  in fiscal adjusted ebitda increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  and to million in fiscal the increases in adjusted net income and adjusted ebitda were due to increased revenue  the effect of which was partially offset by higher new product development costs  including the costs associated with the launch of new programs  acquisitions  and with an increase in the number of new sales teams 

table of contents revenue 
revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  and from fiscal to million in fiscal our contract value increased from million as of march  to million as of march   and to million as of march  the increase in revenue in fiscal over fiscal was primarily attributable to the cross selling of existing programs to existing members  the introduction and expansion of new programs  the addition of new member organizations  the acquisition of concuity services  inc  or concuity  and a full fiscal year of revenue from southwind health partners  llc and southwind navigator  llc  which we refer to together as southwind 
the increase in revenue in fiscal over fiscal was primarily attributable to the introduction and expansion of new programs  including our august  acquisition of pivothealth  llc  or pivothealth  a full fiscal year of revenue from cielo medsolutions  llc  or cielo  the cross selling of existing programs to existing members  and price increases 
we offered membership programs as of march   as of march   and as of march  our membership base consisted of  member institutions as of march    member institutions as of march   and  member institutions as of march  our average contract value per member was  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal and  for fiscal cost of services 
cost of services increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  and from fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  cost of services was for fiscal  for fiscal  and for fiscal the increase of million for fiscal was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel and other deliverable costs from new programs  including the acquisitions of southwind and concuity 
the increase of million for fiscal was primarily due to growth and expansion of our crimson software  inc and southwind programs  an increase of million from programs acquired in  and million in fair value adjustments to our acquisition related earn out liabilities 
member relations and marketing expense 
member relations and marketing expense increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  and from fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  member relations and marketing expense in fiscal   and was   and  respectively 
the total dollar increases in member relations and marketing expense over each of the fiscal years were primarily due to increases in sales staff and related travel and other associated costs  as well as to an increase in member relations personnel and related costs required to serve our expanding membership base 
we had an average of   and new business development teams during fiscal   and  respectively 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  and from fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expense in fiscal   and was   and  respectively 
the increase of million in general and administrative expense for fiscal was primarily due to an increase of million in direct recruitment costs  as well as to a million increase in costs of administrative personnel to support our growing employee base 
the increase of million in general and administrative expense for fiscal was primarily attributable to an increase in new product development costs of million  which included million in legal costs relating to our acquisitions of pivothealth and cielo  and formation of evolent  an increase in share based compensation of million  and increased recruiting  human resources  and finance personnel costs incurred to support our growing employee base 
as of march   we had approximately  employees compared to  as of march  depreciation and amortization of property and equipment expense 
depreciation expense decreased from million  or of revenue  in fiscal  to million  or of revenue  in fiscal  and increased to million  or of revenue  in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was primarily attributable to decreased amortization expense from developed capitalized internal use software tools following a write off of capitalized software during fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily due to increased amortization expense from technology acquired in the cielo acquisition and amortization expense from developed capitalized internal use software tools  and to a lesser extent  depreciation on our newly constructed austin  texas office and expansion of our washington  dc headquarters 
write off of capitalized software 
during fiscal  we recognized an impairment charge on capitalized internally developed software assets of million  with no comparable expense in subsequent fiscal years 

table of contents other income  net 
other income  net decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  and increased to million in fiscal other income  net consists of interest income  unrealized gain resulting from changes in the fair value of the investment in common stock warrants  and foreign exchange rate gains and losses 
other income  net consisted of interest income of million and a foreign exchange rate gain of  in fiscal  interest income of million and a foreign exchange rate gain of million in fiscal  and interest income of million  a foreign exchange rate gain of million  and a gain of million on an investment in common stock warrants in fiscal interest income decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to lower interest rates and lower average invested cash balances resulting from cash payments for the acquisitions of southwind and concuity in fiscal and  respectively 
higher average cash and investment balances contributed to an increase in interest income from million in fiscal to million in fiscal during fiscal   and  we recognized a foreign exchange gains of   and  respectively  as a result of the effect of fluctuating currency rates on our receivable balances denominated in foreign currencies 
provision for income taxes 
our provision for income taxes was million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
our effective tax rate in fiscal   and was   and  respectively 
the increases in our effective tax rate in fiscal and fiscal were primarily due to the effects that higher net income has on our effective rate when compared to the fixed nature of our washington dc tax credits that we receive due to our status as a qualified high technology company under the new e conomy transformation act of equity in loss of unconsolidated entity 
our proportionate share of the losses of evolent during fiscal was million 
we did not recognize a comparable loss in the prior year periods  as evolent was formed on august  loss from discontinued operations  net of tax 
on january   we sold substantially all of the assets of optilink 
as a result  we recorded the net loss or income generated by optilink as discontinued operations of million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
gain on sale of discontinued operations 
in fiscal  we recorded a gain of million from the sale of optilink  after tax 
stock based compensation expense 
we recognized the following stock based compensation expense in the consolidated statements of income line items for stock options and rsus issued under our stock incentive plans and for shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan for fiscal   and in thousands except per share amounts year ended march  stock based compensation expense included in costs and expenses cost of services member relations and marketing general and administrative depreciation and amortization total costs and expenses operating income net income impact on diluted earnings per share there are no stock based compensation costs capitalized as part of the cost of an asset 
stock based compensation expense by award type is below in thousands year ended march  stock based compensation expense by award type stock options restricted stock units employee stock purchase rights total stock based compensation 
table of contents stock based compensation for fiscal included pre tax charges relating to the acceleration of the remaining expense on cancelled stock option awards of approximately million recorded in cost of services  million recorded in member relations and marketing expense  and million recorded in general and administrative expense 
as of march   million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock based compensation is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
non gaap financial measures we use non gaap financial measures to supplement the financial information presented on a gaap basis 
the non gaap financial measures presented in this report include adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income  and non gaap earnings per diluted share 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income before provision for income taxes from continuing operations  other income  net  which includes interest income  gain on investment in common stock warrants  and foreign currency gains  depreciation and amortization of property and equipment  amortization of intangibles included in cost of services  equity in loss of unconsolidated entity  gain on sale of discontinued operations  net of tax  loss income from discontinued operations  net of tax  non cash charges associated with the write off of capitalized software  cancellation of certain stock options  acquisition and similar transaction charges  fair value adjustments to acquisition related earn out liabilities  and share based compensation expense 
we define adjusted net income as net income excluding equity in loss of unconsolidated entity  gain on sale of discontinued operations  loss income from discontinued operations  net of tax  amortization of acquisition related intangibles  acquisition and similar transaction charges  fair value adjustments to acquisition related earn out liabilities  gain on investment in common stock warrants  non cash charges associated with the write off of capitalized software  net of tax  cancellation of certain stock options  and share based compensation expense 
we define non gaap earnings per diluted share as earnings per diluted share excluding equity in loss of unconsolidated entity  gain on sale of discontinued operations  net of tax  loss income from discontinued operations  net of tax  amortization of acquisition related intangibles  acquisition and similar transaction charges  fair value adjustments to acquisition related earn out liabilities  gain on investment in common stock warrants  non cash charges associated with the write off of capitalized software  net of tax  cancellation of certain stock options  and share based compensation expense 
our management believes that providing information about adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income  and non gaap earnings per diluted share facilitates an assessment by our investors of the company s fundamental operating trends and addresses concerns of management and investors that the various gains and expenses excluded from these measures may obscure such underlying trends 
our management uses these non gaap financial measures  together with financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap  to enhance its understanding of our core operating performance  which represents our views concerning our performance in the ordinary  ongoing  and customary course of our operations 
in the future  we are likely to incur income and expenses similar to these items  and we expect to report non gaap financial measures excluding such items again 
accordingly  the exclusion of these and similar items in our non gaap presentation should not be interpreted as implying that the items are non recurring  infrequent  or unusual 
the information about our core operating performance provided by our non gaap financial measures is used by management for a variety of purposes 
management uses the non gaap financial measures for internal budgeting and other managerial purposes in part because the measures enable management to evaluate projected operating results and make comparative assessments of our performance over time while isolating the effects of items that vary from period to period without any correlation to core operating performance  such as tax rates  interest income and foreign currency exchange rates  periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets  share based compensation expense  and certain non cash and special charges 
the effects of the foregoing items also vary widely among similar companies  and affect the ability of management and investors to make company to company comparisons 
in addition  merger and acquisition activity can have inconsistent effects on earnings that are not related to core operating performance due  for instance  to charges relating to acquisition costs  the amortization of acquisition related intangibles  and fluctuations in the fair value of contingent earn out liabilities 
companies also exhibit significant variations with respect to capital structure and cost of capital which affect relative interest expense and differences in taxation and book depreciation of facilities and equipment which affect relative depreciation expense  including significant differences in the depreciable lives of similar assets among various companies 
by eliminating some of the foregoing variations  management believes that the company s non gaap financial measures allow management and investors to evaluate more effectively the company s performance relative to that of its competitors and peer companies 
similarly  our management believes that because of the variety of equity awards used by companies  the varying methodologies for determining both share based compensation and share based compensation expense among companies and from period to period  and the subjective assumptions involved in those determinations  excluding share based compensation from our non gaap financial measures enhances company to company comparisons over multiple fiscal periods 

table of contents our non gaap measures may be calculated differently from similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences in accounting policies and items excluded or included in the adjustments  which limits their usefulness as comparative measures 
in addition  there are other limitations associated with the non gaap financial measures we use  including the following the non gaap financial measures generally do not reflect depreciation and amortization  and although the assets being depreciated and amortized will in some cases have to be replaced in the future  the measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  the non gaap financial measures do not reflect the expense of equity awards to employees  the non gaap financial measures do not reflect the effect of earnings or charges resulting from matters that management considers not indicative of our ongoing operations  but which may recur from year to year  and to the extent that we change our accounting for certain transactions or other items from period to period  our non gaap financial measures may not be directly comparable from period to period 
our management compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results and using the non gaap financial measures only as a supplemental measure of our operating performance  and by considering independently the economic effects of the foregoing items that are or are not reflected in the non gaap measures 
due to their limitations  our non gaap financial measures should be considered by our investors only in addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap  and should not be considered to be a substitute for  or superior to  the gaap measures as indicators of operating performance 
a reconciliation of our non gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures is provided below in thousands

we believe that existing cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities balances and operating cash flows will be sufficient to support operating and capital expenditures  as well as share repurchases  during at least the next months 
after the foregoing period  we may require additional capital for investment in our business 
the amount and timing of any additional investment will depend on the anticipated demand for our products and services  the availability of funds and other factors 
we had cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities balances of million as of march  and million as of march  we expended million and million in cash to purchase shares of our common stock through our share repurchase program during fiscal and  respectively 
we had no long term indebtedness as of march  or cash flows from operating activities 
the combination of revenue growth  profitable operations  and payment for memberships in advance of accrual revenue recognition typically results in operating activities that generate cash flows in excess of net income on an annual basis 
net cash flows provided by operating activities were million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal the increase in net cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal was primarily due to the increase in net income and deferred revenue  partially offset by an increase in excess tax benefits resulting from the exercise of employee stock options 
the increase in net cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal was primarily due to acceleration in contract value and deferred revenue growth  as well as to an increase in adjusted net income 
cash flows from investing activities 
our cash management and investment and acquisition strategy and capital expenditure programs affect investing cash flows 
net cash flows used in investing activities were million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal in fiscal  investing activities used million in cash  primarily consisting of million used in our acquisition of southwind and the related escrow  a million investment in a company that provides revenue cycle technology  and capital expenditures of million  partially offset by the net proceeds of million realized on the redemption and sales of marketable securities 
in fiscal  investing activities used million in cash  primarily consisting of million used in our acquisitions of concuity and cielo  million used on the net purchases of marketable securities  and capital expenditures of million 
in fiscal  investing activities used million in cash  primarily consisting of million used in our acquisition of pivothealth  our initial capital contribution of million to evolent  capital expenditures of million  and the net purchases of marketable securities of million 
the effect of these expenditures was partially offset by the net proceeds of million realized on the sale of discontinued operations 
cash flows from financing activities 
we used net cash flows in financing activities of million in fiscal we had net cash flows provided by financing activities of million in fiscal and million in fiscal 
table of contents in fiscal  we used net cash flows in financing activities of million  consisting of approximately million to repurchase  shares of our common stock and million withheld to satisfy minimum employee tax withholding for vested restricted stock units  the effect of which was partially offset by million received from the exercise of stock options and million from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
in fiscal  we had net cash flows provided by financing activities of million  consisting of million from the exercise of stock options  million received from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan  and million in excess tax benefits resulting from the exercise of employee options 
the effect of those items was partially offset by our repurchase of  shares of our common stock for approximately million and our use of million to satisfy minimum employee tax withholding for vested restricted stock units

contractual obligations 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations as of march  these obligations relate to leases for our headquarters and other offices as well as purchase obligations for software development services  both of which are more fully described in note  commitments and contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
payment due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years non cancelable operating leases purchase obligations in addition to the contractual obligations above  as of march  we have payments of up to million contingently payable through december  related to business acquisitions 
for additional detail  see note fair value measurements  to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
share repurchase in january  our board of directors authorized the repurchase by us from time to time of up to million of our common stock 
this authorization was increased in cumulative amount to million in october  to million in february  to million in january  to million in july   and to million in april we intend to fund any future share repurchases with cash on hand and with cash generated from operations 
no minimum number of shares for repurchase has been fixed  and the share repurchase authorization has no expiration date 
all repurchases have been made in the open market pursuant to this publicly announced repurchase program 
as of march   the remaining authorized repurchase amount was million 
exercise of stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan options granted to participants under our stock based incentive compensation plans that were exercised to acquire shares in fiscal   and generated cash of approximately million  million  and million  respectively  from payment of option exercise prices 
in addition  in fiscal   and cash flows of approximately million  million  and million  respectively  were provided by discounted stock purchases by participants under our employee stock purchase plan 
off balance sheet arrangements as of march   we had no off balance sheet financing or other arrangements with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities established for purposes of facilitating off balance sheet financing or other debt arrangements or for other contractually limited purposes 

table of contents summary of critical accounting policies we have identified the following policies as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
this listing is not a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap  with no need for management s judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and may require the application of significant judgment by our management 
in applying those policies  our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
those estimates are based on our historical experience  our observation of trends in the industry  information provided by our members  and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
for a more detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note  summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
our critical accounting policies are discussed below 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable  services have been rendered and payment has been contractually earned  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
fees are generally billable when a letter of agreement is signed by the member  and fees receivable during the subsequent twelve month period and related deferred revenue are recorded upon the commencement of the membership or collection of fees  if earlier 
in many of our higher priced programs and membership agreements with terms that are greater than one year  fees may be billed on an installment basis 
multiple deliverable arrangements in october  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  amended the accounting standards for revenue recognition with multiple elements for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  the amended guidance allows the use of management s best estimate of selling price for individual elements of an arrangement when vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  or third party evidence  or tpe  is unavailable 
additionally  the guidance eliminates the residual method of revenue recognition in accounting for multiple element arrangements and expands the disclosure requirements for revenue recognition 
this guidance was adopted prospectively by us on april   and as a result  we have updated our accounting policy for revenue recognition related to multiple deliverable arrangements 
we have historically recognized and will continue to recognize the majority of our revenue on a ratable basis over the term of the memberships 
our membership agreements with our customers generally include more than one deliverable 
deliverables are determined based upon the availability and delivery method of the services and may include best practices research  executive education curricula  web based content  databases  and calculators  performance or benchmarking reports  diagnostic tools  interactive advisory support  and software tools 
access to such deliverables is generally available on an unlimited basis over the membership period 
when an agreement contains multiple deliverables  we review the deliverables to determine if they qualify as separate units of accounting 
in order for deliverables in a multiple deliverable arrangement to be treated as separate units of accounting  the deliverables must have standalone value upon delivery  and delivery or performance of undelivered items in an arrangement with a general right of return must be probable 
if we determine that there are separate units of accounting  arrangement consideration at the inception of the membership period is allocated to all deliverables based on the relative selling price method in accordance with the selling price hierarchy  which includes vsoe  if available  tpe if vsoe is not available  or best estimate of selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
our membership programs may contain certain deliverables that do not have standalone value and therefore are not accounted for separately 
in general  the deliverables in membership programs are consistently available throughout the membership period  and  as a result  the consideration is recognized ratably over the membership period 
when a service offering includes unlimited and limited service offerings  revenue is then recognized over the appropriate service period  either ratably  if the service is consistently available  or  if the service is not consistently available  upon the earlier of the delivery of the service or the completion of the membership period  provided that all other criteria for recognition have been met 
certain membership programs incorporate hosted software tools 
in many of these agreements  members are charged set up fees in addition to subscription fees for access to the hosted web based business intelligence tools and related membership services 
both set up fees and subscription fees are recognized ratably over the term of the membership agreement  which is generally three years and is consistent with the pattern of the delivery of services under these arrangements 
upon launch of a new program that incorporates a software tool  all program revenue is deferred until the program is generally available for release to our membership  and then recognized ratably over the remainder of the contract term of each agreement 

table of contents we also perform professional services sold under separate agreements that include management and consulting services 
we recognize professional services revenues on a time and materials basis as services are rendered 
allowance for uncollectible revenue our ability to collect outstanding receivables from our members has an effect on our operating performance and cash flows 
we maintain an allowance for uncollectible revenue as a reduction of revenue based on our ongoing monitoring of members credit and the aging of receivables 
to determine the allowance for uncollectible revenue  we examine our collections history  the age of accounts receivable in question  any specific member collection issues that have been identified  general market conditions  and current economic trends 
property and equipment property and equipment consists of leasehold improvements  furniture  fixtures  equipment  capitalized internal software development costs  and acquired developed technology 
property and equipment is stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
in certain membership programs  we provide software tools under a hosting arrangement where the software application resides on our service providers hardware 
the members do not take delivery of the software and only receive access to the software tools during the term of their membership agreement 
computer software development costs that are incurred in the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred 
during the development stage  direct consulting costs and payroll and payroll related costs for employees that are directly associated with each project are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software once placed into operation 
capitalized software is amortized using the straight line method over its estimated useful life  which is generally five years 
replacements and major improvements are capitalized  while maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
acquired developed technology is classified as property and equipment because the developed software application resides on our service providers hardware 
amortization for acquired developed software is included in the depreciation and amortization of property and equipment line item of our consolidated statements of income 
acquired developed software is amortized over its estimated useful life of nine years based on the cash flow estimate used to determine the value of the intangible asset 
furniture  fixtures  and equipment are depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which range from three to seven years 
leasehold improvements are depreciated using the straight line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease term 
business combinations we record acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
all of the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  contractual contingencies  and contingent consideration are recognized at their fair value on the acquisition date 
all subsequent changes to a valuation allowance or uncertain tax position that relate to the acquired company and existed at the acquisition date that occur both within the measurement period and as a result of facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date are recognized as an adjustment to goodwill 
all other changes in valuation allowance are recognized as a reduction or increase to expense or as a direct adjustment to additional paid in capital as required 
we capitalize any acquired in process research and development as an intangible asset and amortize it over its estimated useful life 
acquisition related costs are recorded as expenses in the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and other intangible assets the excess cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  but rather tested for impairment on an annual basis as of march  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment 
we have concluded that our reporting units that we use to assess goodwill impairment are the same as our operating segments 

table of contents we early adopted fasb accounting standard update  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment on march  in connection with the performance of our annual goodwill impairment test 
the new guidance provides entities with the option of first performing a qualitative assessment on a reporting unit to determine whether further quantitative impairment testing is necessary 
if an initial qualitative assessment identifies that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  additional quantitative testing is performed 
if the quantitative testing indicates that goodwill is impaired  the carrying value of goodwill is written down to fair value 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on the income approach  under which the fair value of a reporting unit is calculated based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  discount rates and future economic and market conditions 
our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
these valuations require the use of management s assumptions  which would not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur 
based on our qualitative assessment as of march   we had no reporting unit that our management believed was at risk of failing an impairment test that would result in a material impairment charge 
no quantitative testing was deemed necessary 
other intangible assets consist of capitalized software for sale and acquired intangibles 
we capitalize consulting costs and payroll and payroll related costs for employees directly related to building a software product once technological feasibility is established 
we determine that technological feasibility is established by the completion of a detail program design or  in its absence  completion of a working model 
once the software product is ready for general availability  we cease capitalizing costs and begin amortizing the intangible asset on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life through cost of services on our consolidated statements of income 
the weighted average estimated useful life of capitalized software is five years 
other intangible assets include assets that arise from business combinations consisting of developed technology  non competition covenants  trademarks  contracts  and customer relationships that are amortized  on a straight line basis  over six months to ten years 
finite lived intangible assets are required to be amortized over their useful lives and are evaluated for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
recovery of long lived assets excluding goodwill we record our long lived assets  such as property and equipment  at cost 
we review the carrying value of our long lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be fully recoverable 
the test for recoverability is made using an estimate of the undiscounted expected future cash flows and  if required  the impairment loss  if any  is measured as the amount that the carrying value of the asset exceeds the asset s fair value if the asset is not recoverable 
we consider expected cash flows and estimated future operating results  trends  and other available information in assessing whether the carrying value of assets is impaired 
if we determine that an asset s carrying value is impaired  we will record a write down of the carrying value of the identified asset and charge the impairment as an operating expense in the period in which the determination is made 
although we believe that the carrying values of our long lived assets are appropriately stated  changes in strategy or market conditions or significant technological developments could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
deferred incentive compensation and other charges incentive compensation to our employees related to the negotiation of new and renewal memberships  license fees to third party vendors for tools  data  and software incorporated in specific memberships that include software tools  and other direct and incremental costs associated with specific memberships are deferred and amortized over the term of the related memberships 
income taxes deferred income taxes are determined using the asset and liability method 
under this method  temporary differences arise as a result of the difference between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax law and tax rates on the date of the enactment of the change 
stock based compensation we measure and recognize stock based compensation cost based on the estimated fair values of the stock based awards on the grant date 
stock based compensation costs are recognized as an expense in the consolidated statements of income over the vesting periods of the awards 
we calculate the grant date estimated fair value of all stock options  with the exception of the stock options issued with market based conditions  using a black scholes valuation model 
the fair value of stock options issued with market based conditions is calculated on the date of grant using a lattice option pricing model 
determining the estimated fair value of stock based awards is subjective in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including the term of the stock based awards  risk free interest rates over the vesting period  expected dividend rates  the price volatility of our shares  and forfeiture rates of the awards 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and adjusted  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the forfeiture rate is based on historical experience 
our fair value estimates are based on assumptions we believe are reasonable but that are inherently uncertain 
the fair value of restricted stock units is determined as the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant 

table of contents to the extent we change the terms of our employee stock based compensation programs  experience market volatility in the pricing of our common stock that increases the implied volatility calculation  or refine different assumptions in future periods such as forfeiture rates that differ from our current estimates  among other potential factors  the stock based compensation expense that we record in future periods and the tax benefits that we realize may differ significantly from the expense and the tax benefits we have recorded in previous reporting periods

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through our portfolio of cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities  which is designed for safety of principal and liquidity 
cash and cash equivalents include investments in highly liquid us treasury obligations with maturities of less than three months 
as of march   our marketable securities consisted of million in tax exempt notes and bonds issued by various states  and million in us government sponsored enterprise securities 
the weighted average maturity on all our marketable securities as of march  was approximately years 
we perform periodic evaluations of the relative credit ratings related to our cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities 
our portfolio is subject to inherent interest rate risk as investments mature and are reinvested at current market interest rates 
we currently do not use derivative financial instruments to adjust our portfolio risk or income profile 
due to the nature of our investments we have not prepared quantitative disclosure for interest rate sensitivity in accordance with item of the sec s regulation s k as we believe the effect of interest rate fluctuations would not be material 
foreign currency risk 
although they accounted for approximately of our fiscal revenue  our international operations subject us to risks related to currency exchange fluctuations 
prices for our services sold to members located outside the united states are sometimes denominated in local currencies primarily the british pound sterling 
as a consequence  increases in the us dollar against local currencies in countries where we have members would result in a foreign exchange loss recognized by us 
in fiscal   and  we recorded foreign currency exchange gains of   and  respectively  which are included in other income  net in our consolidated statements of income 
a hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material impact on our financial position as of march
