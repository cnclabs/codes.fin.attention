overview we develop  manufacture and sell led chips and led components that we believe are among the industry leading led products on a lumens per watt basis 
our products are used primarily for general lighting applications  including street lights and commercial  industrial and residential lighting 
our led chips may also be used in specialty industrial applications such as uv curing of polymers  led light therapy in medical cosmetic applications  counterfeit detection  and led lighting for horticulture applications 
our core products are led chips and led components  but lighting products have also become an increasingly important part of our business 
we sell blue  green and uv led chips under our mvpled brand to a customer base that is heavily concentrated in a few select markets  including china  taiwan  russia and the united states 
we have also recently launched our new ev led product series in blue  green and uv 
we sell our led chips to packagers or to distributors  who in turn sell to packagers 
in addition  we package a portion of our led chips into led components  which we sell to distributors and end customers in selected markets 
our lighting products customers consist primarily of odms of lighting products and the end users of lighting devices 
we also contract other manufacturers to produce for our sale certain led components products based on our design and technology requirements and under our quality control specifications and final inspection process 
we are a holding company for various wholly and majority owned subsidiaries and joint ventures 
our most significant subsidiary is our wholly owned operating subsidiary  taiwan semileds  where a substantial portion of our assets are held and located  where a substantial portion of our research  development  manufacturing  marketing and sales activities take place  and where most of our employees are based 
in august  we acquired a interest in ning xiang  which is engaged in the design  manufacture and sales of lighting fixtures and systems 
we also have interests in unconsolidated joint ventures that we have accounted for as equity method investments and as such have not consolidated for financial reporting purposes 
as of august   we owned a interest in silq  a joint venture established in malaysia to design  manufacture and sell lighting fixtures and systems 
we expect that this business will incur losses for the near term 
we also owned a equity ownership interest in china semileds as of august  china semileds commencement of production at its foshan manufacturing facility coincided with a reduction in the number of led street and tunnel lighting projects financed by the chinese government  which was the target market for china semileds 
although china semileds has redirected its production and marketing strategy to the indoor lighting market  it faces intense competition 
this change in focus has negatively affected china semileds start up  requiring valuation charges to its inventory to reflect the aggressive pricing it encountered 
it also caused china semileds to idle first a portion of its manufacturing equipment  and then substantially all of its operations resulting in excess capacity charges 
at the same time  the general manager and a significant number of senior managers of china semileds terminated employment during the third quarter of our fiscal 
table of contents in october  china semileds defaulted on its rmb million approximately million unsecured bank loan from agricultural bank of china 
the agricultural bank of china has made a demand for payment and recently obtained court order to seize certain of china semileds property  plant and equipment 
such default has caused shanghai pudong development bank in november to accelerate the maturity of the secured loans that it made to china semileds  which aggregate rmb million approximately million  and demand payment 
the assets pledged as collateral  including the china semileds land right use and buildings  and or other assets may be seized by the banks  and shanghai pudong development bank has already offset rmb million of china semileds cash approximately million against amounts due and demanded additional collateral 
on november   representatives of china semileds shareholders held a meeting regarding the restructuring in which our officers participated 
following this meeting  our officers and management of china semileds determined that it was probable that the shareholders of china semileds would fail to agree to a restructuring plan for china semileds 
this has caused management of china semileds to believe that the carrying amount of its long lived assets might not be fully recoverable and as a result china semileds recognized an impairment charge of rmb million approximately million on its long lived assets  which was reflected in its results for the three months ended august  because of the aforementioned events and the fact that china semileds has incurred an accumulated deficit of rmb million approximately million as of august   china semileds independent auditor has concluded  and stated in its audit report dated november   that substantial doubt exists about china semileds ability to continue as a going concern 
we recognized our proportionate share of the impairment charge during the three months ended august   which reduced the carrying amount of our investment in china semileds which was million at august  and million at may  to zero 
we also took a bad debt charge of million to reflect impairment of accounts and notes receivable from china semileds 
key factors affecting our financial condition  results of operations and business the following are key factors that we believe affect our financial condition  results of operations and business general economic conditions and geographic concentration 
the global financial crisis that began in late caused extreme disruption in the financial markets 
although the disruption in the global financial markets moderated thereafter  the global recession and disruption of the financial markets has led to concerns over the solvency of certain european union member states 
in addition  on august   standard poor s downgraded the us credit rating to aa from its top rank of aaa  which had a material adverse effect on the financial markets throughout the world 
credit downgrades of other significant countries have followed 
continued concerns over further credit rating agency downgrades of the us or other countries  failures by the us or other important markets to sustain economic recovery and concerns that problems affecting european union members may precipitate wider global contraction could have a significant impact on the led industry and our financial results 
when the global economy slows or a financial crisis occurs  consumer and government confidence declines  with levels of government grants and subsidies for led adoption and consumer spending likely to be adversely impacted 
our revenues have been concentrated in a few select markets  including china  taiwan  russia and the united states 
given that we are an early stage company operating in a rapidly changing industry  our sales in specific markets may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
therefore  our financial results will be impacted by general economic and political conditions in such markets 
in addition  we derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers 
some of our largest customers and what we produce have 
table of contents produced for them have changed from quarter to quarter primarily as a result of the timing of discrete  large project based purchases and broadening customer base  among other things 
for the year ended august   sales to our three largest customers  in the aggregate  accounted for of our revenues 
industry growth and demand for products and applications using led chips 
the overall adoption of led lighting devices to replace traditional lighting sources are expected to influence the growth and demand for led chips and impact our financial performance 
as a substantial portion of our led chips and led components and our lighting products are used by end users in general lighting applications  the adoption of leds into these applications will have a strong impact on the demand of led chips generally and  as a result  for our led chips  led components and led lighting products 
fluctuations in demand for lighting products will also affect the results of ning xiang 
average selling price of our products 
our financial performance is affected by the average selling price of our led chips and led components 
the price that we charge to our customers is subject to a variety of factors  including prices charged by our competitors  the efficacy of our products  our cost basis  the size of the order and our relationship with the relevant customer  as well as general market and economic conditions 
increased competition  which began in calendar year  and continued through the fourth quarter of our fiscal  created a highly aggressive pricing environment 
some of our competitors have in the past reduced their average selling prices  and the resulting competitive pricing pressures have caused us to similarly reduce our prices  accelerating the decline in the gross margin of our products 
when prices decline  we must also write down the value of our inventory 
average selling prices are also affected by the mix of products that we sell in any given period 
in particular  as the led industry develops and technical specifications and market standards change  we must continue to develop and offer competitive products that meet our customers specifications and pricing requirements 
average selling prices for our led chips and led components are also impacted to a significant extent by the stage of our products life cycles  with average selling prices being higher early in the life cycle of a product and prices decreasing over time as products age and new products with higher efficacies are introduced 
therefore  our ability to continue to innovate by introducing higher efficacy led chips at lower costs will have a material influence on our ability to improve our product margins  although in the near term the introduction of such higher efficacy led chips may further reduce the selling prices of our existing products or render them obsolete 
reduction in the average selling price of lighting products will also affect the results of ning xiang 
our ability to reduce cost to offset lower average prices 
competitors may reduce average selling prices faster than our ability to reduce costs  and competitive pricing pressures may accelerate the rate of decline of our average selling prices 
to address increased pricing pressure  we have invested in the development of larger wafer sizes  in particular using wafers  which we believe should lower our production costs 
we have substantially converted our manufacturing of led chips based on wafer technology 
we have also improved and increased our production yields to reduce the per unit cost of production for our products 
however  such cost savings currently have limited impact on our gross profit  as we suffered from the underutilization of our manufacturing capacity  primarily for our led chips  starting in the fourth quarter of our fiscal and continuing through the fourth quarter of our fiscal  and must absorb a high level of fixed cost such as depreciation 
while we intend to focus on managing our costs and expenses  over the long term we expect to be required to invest substantially if we are to grow 
intellectual property issues 
competitors of ours and other third parties have in the past and will likely from time to time in the future allege that our products infringe on their intellectual property rights 
defending against any intellectual property infringement claims would likely 
table of contents result in costly litigation and ultimately may lead to our not being able to manufacture  use or sell products found to be infringing 
we recently settled an intellectual property dispute involving cree 
we agreed to dismiss amended complaints filed against each other without prejudice 
we agreed to the entry of a permanent injunction that was effective october  that precludes us from and or from assisting others in making  using  importing  selling and or offering to sell in the united states certain accused products and or any device that includes such an accused product after that date and to payment of a settlement fee for past damages 
all accused products sold before the date of settlement are released under this agreement and our customers and distributors are specifically released 
all remaining claims between cree and us were withdrawn without prejudice  with each retaining the right to assert them in the future 
however  other third parties may also assert infringement claims against our customers with respect to our products  or our customers products that incorporate our technologies or products 
any such legal action or the threat of legal action against us  or our customers  could impair such customers continued demand for our products 
this could prevent us from growing or even maintaining our revenues  or cause us to incur additional costs and expenses  and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to continue to innovate 
as part of our growth strategy  we plan to continue to be innovative in product design  to deliver new products and to improve our manufacturing efficiencies 
our continued success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new  technologically advanced and lower cost products  such as more efficient  higher brightness led chips 
if we are unable to introduce new products that are commercially viable and meet rapidly evolving customer requirements or keep pace with evolving technological standards and market developments or are otherwise unable to execute our product innovation strategy effectively  we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities as they arise  execute our business plan or be able to compete effectively 
during the fourth quarter of our fiscal  we announced the launch of our new ev led product series  capable of operating at a higher junction temperature and with higher thermal endurance  as well as a new ceramic led component that incorporates the ev chip and also offers customers greater flexibility in making color choices 
our near term success will depend upon how attractive these products are to our customers versus competitors offerings and our customers willingness and promptness in qualifying the ev led products 
our ability to achieve consistently high manufacturing yields 
we measure our manufacturing yield per wafer by the number of saleable led chips produced  compared to the theoretical maximum number of led chips that can be produced on such wafer 
it is critical for us to achieve high manufacturing yields in order to improve our margins 
we expect to have to continually attain higher yields from our existing wafer sizes and develop new technologies that allow us to efficiently migrate to larger wafer sizes 
our success in achieving sufficient profitability with respect to the recently launched ev leds also requires that we optimize our manufacturing process to achieve suitable yields as soon as possible 
our ability to realize our strategic initiatives 
our china strategy was initially premised on continuing our growth in china through china semileds 
the launch of china semileds was not successful  coinciding with a downturn in the number of led street and tunnel light projects financed by the chinese government  which was its target market 
the shareholders of china semileds have been working towards implementing certain restructuring plans  which would include raising additional funds by issuing new common equity to provide liquidity to support china semileds operations and to strengthen its financial position  the effect of which would likely significantly dilute our equity interest in china semileds 
china semileds financial resources are limited and we do not believe that such a restructuring is probable 
even if a restructuring can be effected  there can be no assurance that the restructuring would be 
table of contents successful  and  particularly if the banks seize china semileds assets  liquidation of china semileds may be required 
see business our joint ventures and investments china semileds 
we may not be able to recover anything from our investment 
furthermore  we now no longer view china semileds as the vehicle to drive our growth in china 
as the world s second largest economy and one that is geographically close to our manufacturing operations  china continues to represent a key market for our products and we will need a new strategy to successfully exploit the opportunities that it presents 
components of consolidated statements of operations revenues  net while led chips originally represented our core product  an increasing percentage of our revenues is generated from the sale of led components and lighting products 
our revenues and the percentage of total revenues by products for the years ended august   and are as follows years ended august  in thousands revenues  net led chips led components lighting products other total other includes primarily revenues attributable to the sale of epitaxial wafers  scraps and raw materials  and the provision of services 
our revenues are affected by sales volumes of our led chips  led components and lighting products and our average selling prices for such products 
in addition  as we expand and diversify our product offerings and with varying average selling prices  any change in the mix of products that we sell in any given period may affect our total revenues 
for example  average selling prices for our led components are generally higher than for led chips and the average selling prices for our lighting products are higher than for our led chips and led components 
we recognize revenue on sales of our products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  ownership and risk of loss has transferred and collection of the sales proceeds is probable 
we obtain written purchase authorizations from our customers as evidence of an arrangement and these authorizations generally provide for a specified amount of product at a fixed price 
we typically consider delivery to have occurred at the time of shipment  unless otherwise agreed in the applicable sales terms  as this is generally when title and risk of loss for the product passes to the customer 
our larger customers typically provide us with non binding rolling forecasts of their requirements for the coming one to three months  however  recent global economic uncertainty and weakness has led to reduced spending in our target markets and made it difficult for our customers and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities 
our customers may increase  decrease  cancel or delay purchase orders already in place  with no material consequences to the customer 
as a result  we may face increased inventories and our backlog may decline as a result of any economic downturn or material change in market conditions or economic outlook 
we price our products in accordance with 
table of contents prevailing market conditions  taking into account the technical specifications of the product being sold  the order volume  the strength and history of our relationship with the customer  our inventory levels and our capacity utilization 
when average selling prices drop  as they did in the years ended august  and  inventory write downs to net realizable income may also result 
our customers for led chips consist of both packagers and distributors who sell our led chips to their packaging customers 
packagers in turn sell their packaged led components to end users of lighting devices 
our customers for led components consist primarily of distributors and end customers in selected markets 
our lighting products customers consist primarily of odms of lighting products and the end users of these lighting devices 
distributors accounted for  and of our revenues for the years ended august   and  respectively 
our revenues attributable to our ten largest customers accounted for  and of our revenues for the years ended august   and  respectively 
our revenues are concentrated in a few select markets  including china  taiwan  russia and the united states 
net revenues generated from sales to countries in these markets  in the aggregate  represented  and  respectively  of our revenues for the years ended august   and  respectively 
we expect that our revenues will continue to be substantially derived from these countries for the foreseeable future 
given that we are an early stage company operating in a rapidly changing industry  our sales in specific markets may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
therefore  our financial results will be impacted by general economic and political conditions in such markets 
our revenues by geographic region are based on the billing addresses of our customers 
the following table sets forth our revenues by geographic region and the percentage of total revenues represented by each geographic region for the periods indicated years ended august  in thousands revenues  net taiwan china  including hong kong russia united states others individually less than of total net revenues total our revenues are presented net of estimated sales returns and discounts 
we estimate sales returns and discounts based on our historical discounts and return rates and our assessment of future conditions 
cost of revenues our cost of revenues consists primarily of cost of materials  depreciation expenses  manufacturing overhead costs  direct labor costs and utilities cost  all related to the manufacture of our led products 
materials include raw materials  other materials such as gases and chemicals  consumables  and assembly materials 
because our products are manufactured based on customers orders and specifications and we purchase materials and supplies to support such orders  we generally purchase our materials at spot prices in the marketplace and do not maintain long term supply contracts 
we purchase materials from several suppliers 
our procurement policy is to select only a small number of 
table of contents qualified vendors who demonstrate quality of materials and reliability on delivery time 
we are subject to variations in the cost of our materials and consumables from period to period 
moreover  because we consume a significant amount of electricity in our manufacturing process  any fluctuations in electricity costs will have an impact on our cost of revenues 
we also use contract manufacturers to produce for our sale certain led components products and for certain aspects of our lighting assembly processes based on our design and technology requirements and under our quality control specifications and final inspection process 
direct labor costs consist of salary including stock based compensation  bonus  training  retirement and other costs related to our employees engaged in the manufacture of our products 
manufacturing overhead costs consist primarily of salaries  bonuses and other benefits including stock based compensation expenses for our administrative personnel allocated to manufacturing functions  repairs and maintenance costs for equipment and machinery maintenance costs and lease expenses 
our cost of revenues also includes excess capacity charges as a result of the underutilization of our manufacturing capacity and inventory valuation adjustments to write down our inventories to their estimated net realizable values as a result of declines in their average selling prices 
operating expenses our operating expenses include research and development expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses 
the components of our operating expenses and percentage of such expenses as a percentage of total operating expenses for the years ended august   and comprised the following years ended august  in thousands operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative impairment of long lived assets provision for litigation settlement total research and development 
our research and development expenses  which are expensed as incurred  consist primarily of expenses related to employee salaries  bonuses and other benefits including stock based compensation expenses for our research and development personnel  engineering charges related to product design  purchases of materials and supplies  repairs and maintenance and depreciation related expenses 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase as we hire additional personnel and devote more resources to research and development to improve our technologies and manufacturing processes and to reduce manufacturing costs 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  bonuses and other benefits including stock based compensation expenses for our administrative  sales and marketing personnel  expenses for professional services  which include fees and expenses for accounting  legal  tax and valuation services  amortization and depreciation related expenses  which consists primarily of customer relationships acquired in a business combination  marketing related travel  lease expenses  entertainment expenses  allowance for doubtful accounts and general office related expenses 
we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses to continue to increase as we increase our sales and marketing efforts in line with the expansion of our business and product offerings 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets 
we recognized an impairment charge on certain of our property  plant and equipment for the year ended august  the impairment charge was primarily related to machinery and equipment used in the manufacturing of led chips 
provision for litigation settlement 
we recognized a provision and cash payment for litigation settlement for the year ended august  associated with the cree litigation 
other income expense equity in losses from unconsolidated entities  net 
loss from unconsolidated entities consists of our portion of the income or losses of china semileds  silq and ss optoelectronics  which was dissolved in september these entities have been accounted for using the equity method of accounting  and as such  we generally recognize our portion of the net income or loss from such entities in our consolidated statements of operations 
we report our investment in such entities as investments in unconsolidated entities on our consolidated balance sheets and such investment amounts are initially stated at cost  and subsequently adjusted for our portion of equity in undistributed earnings or losses 
if the value of our investment in such entities declines  and the decline is determined to be other than temporary  the investment would be written down to fair value 
as of august   the carrying amount of our investment in china semileds had been reduced to zero
