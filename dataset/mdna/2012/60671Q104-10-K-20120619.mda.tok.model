in making these statements we have made certain assumptions 
while we believe our plans  intentions  expectations  assumptions and strategies reflected in these forward looking statements are reasonable  we cannot assure you that these plans  intentions  expectations assumptions and strategies will be achieved 
our actual results  performance or achievements could differ materially from those contemplated  expressed or implied by the forward looking statements contained in this report as a result of various factors  including the risks and uncertainties discussed below

risks relating to our business our quarterly and annual revenues and operating results have historically fluctuated  and the results of one period may not provide a reliable indicator of our future performance 
our quarterly and annual revenues and operating results have historically fluctuated and are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods 
a number of factors may cause our financial results to fluctuate significantly from period to period  including general economic conditions  the fact that an individual order or contract can represent a substantial amount of revenues for that period  the size  timing and shipment of individual orders  changes in pricing or discount levels by us or our competitors  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  the mix of products sold by us  the timing of the announcement  introduction and delivery of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  the ability to execute on our strategy and operating plans  ability to realize our deferred tax assets  and changes in tax laws  regulations or accounting rules 
as a result of the above factors  a quarterly or yearly comparison of our results of operations is not necessarily meaningful 
prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods 
our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions in key markets  particularly the united states  the united kingdom and elsewhere in europe 
challenging economic conditions worldwide  particularly in the united states  the united kingdom and elsewhere in europe  have from time to time contributed  and may continue to contribute  to slowdowns in the communications industry at large  as well as in specific segments and markets in which we operate  resulting in  but not limited to reduced demand for our products as a result of continued constraints on it related capital spending by our customers  
table of contents increased price competition for our products  risk of excess and obsolete inventories  risk of supply constraints  risk of manufacturing capacity  and higher overhead costs as a percentage of revenue and higher interest expense 
instability in the global credit markets  including the european economic zone and financial turmoil related to sovereign debt issues in certain countries  the instability in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world and other disruptions  such as changes in energy costs  may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions 
the world has recently experienced a global macroeconomic downturn and  if global economic and market conditions or economic conditions in key markets remain uncertain or deteriorate  we may experience material negative impacts on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
we rely on our channel partners for a significant component of our sales and so disruptions to  or our failure to effectively develop and manage our distribution channel and the processes and procedures that support it  could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues 
our future success is highly dependent upon establishing and maintaining successful relationships with a variety of channel partners 
a substantial portion of our revenues is derived through our channel partners  most of which also sell our competitors products 
our revenues depend in part on the performance of these channel partners 
the loss of or reduction in sales to these channel partners could materially reduce our revenues 
our competitors may in some cases be effective in causing our channel partners or potential channel partners to favor their products or prevent or reduce sales of our solutions 
if we fail to maintain relationships with these channel partners  fail to develop new relationships with channel partners in new markets or expand the number of channel partners in existing markets  or if we fail to manage  train or provide appropriate incentives to existing channel partners or if these channel partners are not successful in their sales efforts  sales of our solutions may decrease and our operating results would suffer 
many potential channel partners in the voice communications business have established relationships with our competitors and may not be willing to invest the time and resources required to train their staff to effectively market our solutions and services 
potential channel partners engaged in the data and software applications communications businesses are less likely to have established relationships with our competitors  but where they are unfamiliar with the voice communications business  they may require substantially more training and other resources to be qualified to sell our solutions 
if changes to our business strategy are not successfully implemented and accepted by our customers  our business could be negatively affected 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we implemented a number of key changes to our business strategy involving  among other things simplifying our business model to more effectively and efficiently support the sales  licensing and marketing of our communications solutions to customers  reallocating our spending on r d with greater emphasis on integrated communications solutions that support the needs of customers that have between and  users  reorganizing our us sales organization by increasing investment in our indirect channel  and focusing our direct sales team on a select group of customers  and continuing our investment  and increasing our market leadership  in voice virtualization 
in january  we continued to execute our strategy to simplify our business and streamline our organization by making the decision to pursue the sale of our datanet business unit 
although we anticipate that a sale will be completed within one year  we are in the process of identifying a purchaser and there is no assurance of when or if a sale will be completed 
if these changes to our business strategy are not aligned with the direction our customers take as they invest in the evolution of their networks and telephony needs  our customers may not buy our solutions or continue to use our services 
any failure by us to successfully execute on one or more changes to our business strategy could adversely impact our business and results of operations 
we face intense competition from many competitors and we may not be able to compete effectively against these competitors 
the market for our solutions is highly competitive 
we compete against many companies  including and in particular  in the case of mcs  avaya inc and cisco systems  inc  as well as aastra technologies limited  alcatel lucent sa  nec corporation  panasonic corporation  
table of contents shoretel  inc  siemens enterprise networks and toshiba corporation  and  in the case of netsolutions  at t inc  cbeyond inc  cypress communications  inc  x  inc  fonality  inc  j global  inc  panterra networks  inc  sprint nextel corporation  telesphere networks  ltd  t mobile usa  inc  us telepacific corp  verizon communications inc  west ip communications  inc 
and xo holdings  inc 
in addition  because the market for our solutions is subject to rapidly changing technologies  we may face competition in the future from companies that do not currently compete in our business communications market  including companies that currently compete in other sectors of the information technology  communications or software industries  such as microsoft corporation and google inc  mobile communications companies or communications companies that serve residential  rather than business  customers 
our industry has also experienced and may continue to experience consolidation that may adversely impact our competitive position 
several of our existing competitors have  and many of our future potential competitors may have  greater financial  personnel  research  project management and other resources  more well established brands or reputations and broader customer bases than we have 
as a result  these competitors may be in a stronger position to respond more quickly to potential acquisitions and other market opportunities  new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
some of these competitors may also have customer bases that are more diversified than ours and therefore may be less affected by an economic downturn in a particular region 
competitors with greater resources may also be able to offer lower prices  additional products or services or other incentives that we do not offer or cannot match 
in addition  existing customers of data communications companies that compete against us may be more inclined to purchase business communications solutions from their current data communications vendor than from us 
we cannot predict which competitors may enter our markets in the future  what form the competition may take or whether we will be able to respond effectively to the entry of new competitors or the rapid evolution in technology and product development that has characterized our markets 
competition from existing and potential market entrants may take many forms 
our products must interface with customer software  equipment and systems in their networks  each of which may have different specifications 
to the extent our competitors supply network software  equipment or systems to our customers  it is possible these competitors could design their technologies to be closed or proprietary systems that are incompatible with our products or work less effectively with our products than their own 
as a result  customers would have an incentive to purchase products that are compatible with the products and technologies of our competitors over our products 
a lack of interoperability may result in significant redesign costs  and harm relations with our customers 
if our products do not interoperate with our customers networks  installations could be delayed or orders for our products could be cancelled  which would result in losses of revenues and customers that could significantly harm our business 
in addition  our competitors may provide large bundled offerings that incorporate applications and products similar to those that we offer 
if our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services in an effort to recapture or gain market share  we may be required to lower our prices or offer other favorable terms to compete effectively  which would reduce our margins and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
our solutions may fail to keep pace with rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards 
the markets for our solutions are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions  short product life cycles and changing business models 
therefore  our operating results depend  among other things  on existing and new markets  our ability to develop and introduce new solutions and our ability to reduce the production costs of existing solutions 
the process of anticipating trends and evolving industry standards and developing new solutions is complex and uncertain  and if we fail to accurately predict and respond to our customers changing needs  and emerging technological trends  our business could be harmed 
we commit significant resources to developing new solutions before knowing whether our investments will result in solutions that the market will accept 
the success of new solutions depends on several factors  including new application and product definition  component costs  timely completion and introduction of these solutions  differentiation of new solutions from those of our competitors and market acceptance of these solutions 
we may not be able to successfully identify new market opportunities for our solutions  develop and bring new solutions to market in a timely manner  or achieve market acceptance of our solutions 
the evolving markets for virtualized  cloud based and hosted ucc solutions are subject to market risks and uncertainties that could cause significant delays and expenses 
we have made a significant investment in developing our ip based communications solutions and transitioning our distribution channels to take advantage of the industry s shift from legacy systems to ip based communications solutions 
the market is evolving rapidly and is characterized by an increasing number of market entrants 
as is typical of a rapidly evolving industry  the demand for and market acceptance is uncertain 
if the market fails to develop  develops more slowly than we anticipate or develops in a manner different than we expect  our solutions could fail to achieve market acceptance  which in turn could significantly harm our business 
moreover  as the market usage grows  the infrastructure used to support these services  whether public or private  may not be able to support the demands placed on them and their performance or reliability may decline 
even if the market becomes more widespread in the future  our solutions may not attain broad market acceptance 
the adoption of solutions in this market on both desktop computers and mobile devices at a rate faster than we currently anticipate may lead to a decline in the utilization of distinct ip and digital devices and a reduction in our desktop device revenues 
in addition  the evolution towards virtualized  cloud based and hosted ucc and ip telephony applications delivered as a service may occur faster and more extensively than currently anticipated  which may adversely impact the sale of our non hosted communications solutions 

table of contents we are dependent on our customers decisions to deploy ip telephony solutions 
our business remains dependant on customer decisions to migrate their legacy telephony infrastructure to ip telephony and other advanced service delivery methods 
while these investment decisions are often driven by macroeconomic factors  customers may also delay adoption of ip telephony due to a range of other factors  including prioritization of other it projects and weighing the costs and benefits of deploying new infrastructures and devices 
ip telephony adoption among new and additional ip telephony customers may not grow at the rates we currently anticipate 
our business may be harmed if we infringe intellectual property rights of third parties 
there is considerable patent and other intellectual property development activity in our industry 
our success depends  in part  upon our not infringing intellectual property rights owned by others 
our competitors  as well as a number of individuals  patent holding companies and consortiums  own  or claim to own  intellectual property relating to our industry 
our solutions may infringe the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties 
we cannot determine with certainty whether any existing third party patent  or the issuance of new third party patents  would require us to alter our solutions  obtain licenses  pay royalties or discontinue the sale of the affected applications and products 
our competitors may use their patent portfolios in an increasingly offensive manner in the future 
we are currently and periodically involved in patent infringement disputes with third parties  including claims that have been made against us for the payment of licensing fees 
we have received notices in the past  and we may receive additional notices in the future  containing allegations that our solutions are subject to patents or other proprietary rights of third parties  including competitors  patent holding companies and consortiums 
current or future negotiations with third parties to establish license or cross license arrangements  or to renew existing licenses  may not be successful and we may not be able to obtain or renew a license on satisfactory terms  or at all 
if required licenses cannot be obtained  or if existing licenses are not renewed  litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our success also depends upon our customers ability to use our products 
claims of patent infringement have been asserted against some of our channel partners based on their use of our solutions 
we generally agree to indemnify and defend our channel partners and direct customers to the extent a claim for infringement is brought against our customers with respect to our solutions 
aggressive patent litigation is common in our industry and can be disruptive 
infringement claims or claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims have been  are currently and may in the future be asserted or prosecuted against us  our channel partners or our customers by third parties 
some of these third parties  including our competitors  patent holding companies and consortiums  have  or have access to  substantially greater resources than we do and may be better able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation 
whether or not the claims currently pending against us  our channel partners or our customers  or those that may be brought in the future  have merit  we may be subject to costly and time consuming legal proceedings 
such claims could also harm our reputation and divert our management s attention from operating our business 
if these claims are successfully asserted against us  we could be required to pay substantial damages including enhanced damages and attorneys fees if infringement is found to be willful 
we could also be forced to obtain a license  which may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all  forced to redesign our solutions to make them non infringing  which redesign may not be possible or  if possible  costly and time consuming  or prevented from selling some or all of our solutions 
our success is dependent on our intellectual property 
our inability or failure to secure  protect and maintain our intellectual property could seriously harm our ability to compete and our financial success 
our success depends on the intellectual property in the solutions that we develop and sell 
we rely upon a combination of copyright  patent  trade secrets  trademarks  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology 
our present protective measures may not be enforceable or adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or independent third party development of the same or similar technology 
even if our patents are held valid and enforceable  others may be able to design around these patents or develop products competitive to our products but that are outside the scope of our patents 
any of our patents may be challenged  invalidated  circumvented or rendered unenforceable 
we may not be successful should one or more of our patents be challenged for any reason 
if our patent claims are rendered invalid or unenforceable  or narrowed in scope  the patent coverage afforded to our solutions could be impaired  which could significantly impede our ability to market our products  negatively affect our competitive position and materially harm our business and operating results 
pending or future patent applications held by us may not result in an issued patent  or if patents are issued to us  such patents may not provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies 
we may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or trade secrets by consultants  vendors  former employees and current employees  despite the existence of nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other contractual restrictions 
furthermore  many foreign jurisdictions offer less protection of intellectual property rights than the united states and canada  and the protection provided to our proprietary technology by the laws of these and other foreign jurisdictions may not be sufficient to protect our technology 
preventing the unauthorized use of our proprietary technology may be difficult  time consuming and costly  in part because it may be difficult to discover unauthorized use by third parties 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual 
table of contents property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights  or to defend against claims of unenforceability or invalidity 
any litigation  whether successful or unsuccessful  could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition regardless of its outcome 
some of the software used with our products  as well as that of some of our customers  may be derived from so called open source software that is made generally available to the public by its authors and or other third parties 
such open source software is often made available to us under licenses  such as the gnu general public license  that impose certain obligations on us in the event we were to make derivative works of the open source software 
these obligations may require us to make source code for the derivative works available to the public  or license such derivative works under an open source license or another particular type of license  potentially granting third parties certain rights to the software  rather than the forms of license customarily used to protect our intellectual property 
failure to comply with such obligations can result in the termination of our distribution of products that contain the open source code or the public dissemination of any enhancements that we made to the open source code 
we may also incur legal expenses in defending against claims that we did not abide by such open source licenses 
in the event the copyright holder of any open source software or another party in interest were to successfully establish in court that we had not complied with the terms of a license for a particular work  we could be subject to potential damages and could be required to release the source code of that work to the public  grant third parties certain rights to the source code or stop distribution of that work 
any of these outcomes could disrupt our distribution and sale of related products and materially adversely affect our business 
we rely on trade secrets and other forms of non patent intellectual property protection 
if we are unable to protect our trade secrets  other companies may be able to compete more effectively against us 
we rely on trade secrets  know how and technology that are not protected by patents to maintain our competitive position 
we try to protect this information by entering into confidentiality agreements with parties that have access to it  such as our partners  collaborators  employees and consultants 
any of these parties may breach these agreements and we may not have adequate remedies for any specific breach 
in addition  our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors 
to the extent that our partners  collaborators  employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us  disputes may arise as to the rights in the related or resulting know how and inventions 
if any of our trade secrets  know how or other technologies not protected by a patent were to be disclosed to  or independently developed by  a competitor  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers 
many of our employees may have been previously employed at other companies which provide integrated communications solutions  including our competitors or potential competitors 
we may be subject to claims that these employees  or we  have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers 
litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims 
even if we are successful in defending against these claims  litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management 
if we fail in defending such claims  in addition to paying money claims  we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel 
a loss of key personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to commercialize certain product candidates  which would adversely affect our commercial development efforts  business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business requires a significant amount of cash  and we may require additional sources of funds if our sources of liquidity are unavailable or insufficient to fund our operations 
we may not generate sufficient cash from operations to meet anticipated working capital requirements  support additional capital expenditures or take advantage of acquisition opportunities 
in order to finance our business  we may need to utilize available borrowings under our revolving credit facility  which is scheduled to terminate on august  our ability to continually access this facility prior to its termination is conditioned upon our compliance with current and potential future covenants contained in the credit agreements governing our revolving credit facility and term loan facility 
we may not be in compliance with such covenants in the future 
we may need to secure additional sources of funding if our cash and borrowings under our revolving credit facility are unavailable or insufficient to finance our operations 
such funding may not be available on terms satisfactory to us  or at all 
in addition  any proceeds from the issuance of equity or debt may be required to be used  in whole or in part  to make mandatory payments under our credit agreements 
if we were to incur higher levels of debt  we would require a larger portion of our operating cash flow to be used to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness 
the increased use of cash to pay indebtedness could leave us with insufficient funds to finance our operating activities  such as r d expenses and capital expenditures 
in addition  any new debt instruments may contain covenants or other restrictions that affect our business operations 
if we were to raise additional funds by selling equity securities  the relative ownership of our existing investors could be diluted or the new investors could obtain terms more favorable than previous investors 

table of contents we have a significant amount of debt  which is scheduled to mature in august and august this debt contains customary default clauses  a breach of which may result in acceleration of the repayment of some or all of this debt 
as of april   we had million outstanding under our first lien term loan  which is scheduled to mature in august and million outstanding under our second lien term loan  which is scheduled to mature in august the credit agreements relating to these loans and the revolving credit facility have customary default clauses 
in the event we were to default on these credit agreements  and were unable to cure or obtain a waiver of default  the repayment of our debt owing under these credit agreements may be accelerated 
if acceleration were to occur  we would be required to secure alternative sources of equity or debt financing to be able to repay the debt 
alternative financing may not be available on terms satisfactory to us  or at all 
if acceptable alternative financing were unavailable  we would have to consider alternatives to fund the repayment of the debt  including the sale of part or all of the business  which sale may occur at a distressed price 
our working capital requirements and cash flows are subject to fluctuation which could have an adverse affect on us 
our working capital requirements and cash flows have historically been  and are expected to continue to be  subject to quarterly and yearly fluctuations  depending on a number of factors 
if we are unable to manage fluctuations in cash flow  our business  operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
for example  if we are unable to effectively manage fluctuations in our cash flows  we may be unable to make required interest payments on our indebtedness 
factors which could result in cash flow fluctuations include the level of sales and the related margins on those sales  the collection of receivables  the timing and volume of sales of leases to third party funding sources and the timing and volume of any repurchase obligations in respect of such sales  the timing and size of capital expenditures  the timing and size of purchase of inventory and related components  the timing of payment on payables and accrued liabilities  costs associated with potential restructuring actions  and customer financing obligations 
because we depend upon a small number of outside contract manufacturers  our operations could be delayed or interrupted if we encounter problems with these contractors 
we do not have any internal manufacturing capabilities  and we rely primarily upon two contract manufacturers flextronics and sanmina 
our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed or interrupted as a result of a variety of factors relating to our contract manufacturers  including failure to effectively manage our contract manufacturer relationships  our contract manufacturers experiencing delays  disruptions or quality control problems in their manufacturing operations  lead times for required materials and components varying significantly and being dependent on factors such as the specific supplier  contract terms and the demand for each component at a given time  under estimating our requirements  resulting in our contract manufacturers having inadequate materials and components required to produce our products  or overestimating our requirements  resulting in charges assessed by the contract manufacturers or liabilities for excess inventory  each of which could negatively affect our gross margins  and the possible absence of adequate capacity and reduced control over component availability  quality assurances  delivery schedules  manufacturing yields and costs 
we are also exposed to risks relating to the financial viability of our contract manufacturers as a result of business and industry risks that affect those manufacturers 
in order to finance their businesses during economic downturns or otherwise  flextronics and sanmina may need to secure additional sources of equity or debt financing 
such funding may not be available on terms satisfactory to them  or at all  which could result in a material disruption to our production requirements 
if any of our contract manufacturers are unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing our products in required volumes and quality levels  we will have to identify  qualify  select and implement acceptable alternative manufacturers  which would likely be time consuming and costly 
in particular  each of flextronics 
table of contents and sanmina are sole manufacturing sources for certain of our products 
a failure of either of these parties to satisfy our manufacturing needs on a timely basis  as a result of the factors described above or otherwise  could result in a material disruption to our business until another manufacturer is identified and able to produce the same products  which could take a substantial amount of time  during which our results of operations  financial condition and reputation among our customers and within our industry could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  alternate sources may not be available to us or may not be in a position to satisfy our production requirements on a timely basis or at commercially reasonable prices and quality 
therefore  any significant interruption in manufacturing could result in us being unable to deliver the affected products to meet our customer orders 
we depend on sole source and limited source suppliers for key components 
if these components are not available on a timely basis  or at all  we may not be able to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers 
we depend on sole source and limited source suppliers for key components of our products 
in addition  our contract manufacturers often acquire these components through purchase orders and may have no long term commitments regarding supply or pricing from their suppliers 
lead times for various components may lengthen  which may make certain components scarce 
as component demand increases and lead times become longer  our suppliers may increase component costs 
we also depend on anticipated product orders to determine our materials requirements 
lead times for limited source materials and components can be as long as six months  vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier  contract terms and demand for a component at a given time 
from time to time  shortages in allocations of components have resulted in delays in filling orders 
shortages and delays in obtaining components in the future could impede our ability to meet customer orders 
any of these sole source or limited source suppliers could stop producing the components  cease operations entirely  or be acquired by  or enter into exclusive arrangements with  our competitors 
as a result  these sole source and limited source suppliers may stop selling their components to our contract manufacturers at commercially reasonable prices  or at all 
any such interruption  delay or inability to obtain these components from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable amount of time would adversely affect our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers and reduce margins realized by us 
delay in the delivery of  or lack of access to  software or other intellectual property licensed from our suppliers could adversely affect our ability to develop and deliver our solutions on a timely and reliable basis 
our business may be harmed by a delay in delivery of software applications from one or more of our suppliers 
many of our solutions are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties 
it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various components in our solutions 
these licenses may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
moreover  the inclusion in our solutions of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a non exclusive basis could limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights to our solutions 
non exclusive licenses also allow our suppliers to develop relationships with  and supply similar or the same software applications to  our competitors 
our software licenses could terminate in the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency of a software supplier or other third party licensor 
our software licenses could also terminate in the event such software infringes third party intellectual property rights 
we have not entered into source code escrow agreements with every software supplier or third party licensor  and we could lose the ability to use such licensed software or implement it in our solutions in the event the licensor breaches its obligations to us 
in the event that software suppliers or other third party licensors terminate their relationships with us  are unable to fill our orders on a timely basis or their licenses are otherwise terminated  we may be unable to deliver the affected products to meet our customer orders 
our operations in international markets involve inherent risks that we may not be able to control 
we do business in over countries 
accordingly  our results could be materially and adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors relating to international business operations  including macroeconomic conditions adversely affecting geographies where we do business  foreign currency exchange rates  political or social unrest or economic instability in a specific country or region  higher costs of doing business in foreign countries  infringement claims on foreign patents  copyrights or trademark rights  difficulties in staffing and managing operations across disparate geographic areas  difficulties associated with enforcing agreements and intellectual property rights through foreign legal systems  trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements  which affect our ability to import or export our products from or to various countries  adverse tax consequences  unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements  
table of contents military conflict  terrorist activities  natural disasters and medical epidemics  and our ability to recruit and retain channel partners in foreign jurisdictions 
our financial results may be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates  and our current currency hedging strategy may not be sufficient to counter such fluctuations 
our financial statements are presented in us dollars  while a significant portion of our business is conducted  and a substantial portion of our operating expenses are payable  in currencies other than the us dollar 
due to the substantial volatility of currency exchange rates  exchange rate fluctuations may have an adverse impact on our future revenues or expenses presented in our financial statements 
we use financial instruments  principally forward exchange contracts  in our management of foreign currency exposure 
these contracts primarily require us to purchase and sell certain foreign currencies with or for us dollars at contracted rates 
we may be exposed to a credit loss in the event of non performance by the counterparties of these contracts 
in addition  these financial instruments may not adequately manage our foreign currency exposure 
our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully manage currency fluctuations in the future 
our financial results will be negatively impacted if we are unable to realize our deferred tax assets as at our fiscal year end  april   our balance sheet contained a million valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
future losses or reduced estimates of future income may result in an increase to the partial valuation allowance or even a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets in future periods  which will negatively impact our results 
see management discussions analysis critical accounting policies deferred taxes 
transfer pricing rules may adversely affect our income tax expenses 
we conduct business operations in various jurisdictions and through legal entities in canada  the united states  the united kingdom and elsewhere 
we and certain of our subsidiaries provide solutions and services to  and may from time to time undertake certain significant transactions with  other subsidiaries in different jurisdictions 
the tax laws of many of these jurisdictions have detailed transfer pricing rules which require that all transactions with non resident related parties be priced using arm s length pricing principles 
contemporaneous documentation must exist to support this pricing 
the taxation authorities in the jurisdictions where we carry on business could challenge our transfer pricing policies 
international transfer pricing is an area of taxation that depends heavily on the underlying facts and circumstances and generally involves a significant degree of judgment 
if any of these taxation authorities are successful in challenging our transfer pricing policies  our income tax expense may be adversely affected and we could also be subjected to interest and penalty charges 
any increase in our income tax expense and related interest and penalties could have a significant impact on our future earnings and future cash flows 
our operating results may be impacted by our ability to sell leases derived from our managed services offering  or a breach of our obligations in respect of such sales 
we offer customers the ability to bundle all their managed service communication expense into a single monthly payment lease  which we then generally pool and sell to third party financial institutions 
we derive revenues from the direct sale of pools of leases to third party financial institutions  many of whom have been impacted by challenging macroeconomic events 
these leases are recurring revenue streams for us and typically produce attractive gross margins 
if we are unable to secure attractive funding rates or sell these leases  our operating results would suffer 
the challenging macroeconomic conditions  coupled with our level of indebtedness  have adversely impacted our ability to sell these leases in the past and may do so again in the future 
moreover  particularly in the current economic environment  the timing  volume and profitability of lease sales from quarter to quarter could impact our operating results 
we have historically sold these pools of leases at least once per quarter 
furthermore  when the initial term of the lease is concluded  our customers have the option to renew the lease at a payment and term less than the original lease 
we have typically held these customer lease renewals on our balance sheet  although we could also elect to sell these renewals to a third party financial institution 
in the event of defaults by lease customers under leases that have been sold  financial institutions that purchased the pool of such leases may require us to repurchase the remaining unpaid portion of such sold leases  subject to certain annual limitations on recourse for credit losses 
the size of credit losses may impact our ability to sell future pools of leases 
under the terms of the program agreements governing the sale of these pools of leases  we are subject to ongoing obligations in connection with the servicing of the underlying leases 
if we are unable to perform these obligations or are otherwise in default under a program agreement  and are unable to cure or obtain a waiver of such default  we could be required by the purchaser to repurchase the entire unpaid portion of the leases sold to such purchaser  which could have an adverse effect on our cash flows and financial condition 

table of contents credit and commercial risks and exposures could increase if the financial condition of our customers declines 
we provide or commit to financing  where appropriate  for our customers 
our ability to arrange or provide financing for our customers depends on a number of factors  including our credit rating  our level of available credit and our ability to sell off commitments on acceptable terms 
pursuant to certain of our customer contracts  we deliver solutions representing an important portion of the contract price before receiving any significant payment from the customer 
as a result of the financing that may be provided to customers and our commercial risk exposure under long term contracts  our business could be adversely affected if the financial condition of our customers erodes 
upon the financial failure of a customer  we may experience losses on credit extended and loans made to such customer  losses relating to our commercial risk exposure  and the loss of the customer s ongoing business 
if customers fail to meet their obligations to us or the recurring revenue stream from customer financings is lost  we may experience reduced cash flows and losses in excess of reserves  which could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial position 
design defects  errors  failures or bugs  which may be difficult to detect  may occur in our solutions 
we sell highly complex solutions that incorporate both hardware and software 
our software may contain bugs that can interfere with expected operations 
our pre shipment testing and field trial programs may not be adequate to detect all defects in individual applications and products or systematic defects that could affect numerous shipments  which might interfere with customer satisfaction  reduce sales opportunities or affect gross margins 
in the past  we have had to replace certain components and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects or bugs in solutions that we had shipped 
any future remediation may have a material impact on our business 
our inability to cure an application or product defect could result in the failure of an application or product line  the temporary or permanent withdrawal from an application  product or market  damage to our reputation  inventory costs  lawsuits by customers or customers or channel partners end users  or application or product reengineering expenses 
the sale and support of solutions containing defects and errors may result in product liability claims and warranty claims 
our insurance may not cover or may be insufficient to cover claims that are successfully asserted against us or our contract suppliers and manufacturers 
our business may suffer if our strategic alliances are not successful 
we have a number of strategic alliances  including vmware  inc and research in motion limited  and continue to pursue strategic alliances with other companies 
the objectives and goals for a strategic alliance can include one or more of the following technology exchange  product development  joint sales and marketing  or new market creation 
if a strategic alliance fails to perform as expected or if the relationship is terminated  we could experience delays in product availability or impairment of our relationships with customers  and our ability to develop new solutions in response to industry trends or changing technology may be impaired 
in addition  we may face increased competition if a third party acquires one or more of our strategic alliances or if our competitors enter into additional successful strategic relationships 
we may make strategic acquisitions in the future 
we may not be successful in operating or integrating these acquisitions 
as part of our business strategy  we may consider acquisitions of  or significant investments in  other businesses that offer products  services and technologies complementary to ours 
any such acquisition or investment could materially adversely affect our operating results and the price of our common shares 
acquisitions and other strategic investments involve significant risks and uncertainties  including unanticipated costs and liabilities  difficulties in integrating new products  software  businesses  operations and technology infrastructure in an efficient and effective manner  difficulties in maintaining customer relations  the potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses  the diversion of the attention of our senior management from the operation of our daily business  the potential adverse effect on our cash position as a result of all or a portion of an acquisition purchase price being paid in cash  the potential significant increase of our interest expense  leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition  the potential issuance of securities that would dilute our shareholders percentage ownership  the potential to incur large and immediate write offs and restructuring and other related expenses  and the inability to maintain uniform standards  controls  policies and procedures 

table of contents our inability to successfully operate and integrate newly acquired businesses appropriately  effectively and in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our ability to take advantage of future growth opportunities and other advances in technology  as well as on our revenues  gross margins and expenses 
business interruptions could adversely affect our operations 
our operations and those of our contract manufacturers and outsourced service providers are vulnerable to interruption by fire  earthquake  hurricane  flood or other natural disaster  power loss  computer viruses  security breaches  computer systems failure  telecommunications failure  quarantines  national catastrophe  terrorist activities  war and other events beyond our control 
our disaster recovery plans may not be sufficient to address these interruptions 
the coverage or limits of our business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to compensate for any losses or damages that may occur 
problems with the infrastructure of carriers may impair the performance of our netsolutions business unit solutions and cause problems with the network services we provide to our customers 
we purchase network capacity wholesale from carriers  which we resell to our customers in various retail offerings 
the infrastructures of these telecom carriers are vulnerable to interruption by fires  earthquakes  hurricanes and other similar natural disasters  as well as power loss  computer viruses  security breaches  acts of terrorism  sabotage  intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct 
the occurrence of such a natural disaster or misconduct  or outages affecting these carrier networks  could impair the performance of our solutions and lead to interruptions  delays or cessation of network services to our customers 
any impairment of the performance of our solutions or problems in providing our network services to our customers  even if for a limited time  could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
governmental regulation could harm our operating results and future prospects 
governments in a number of jurisdictions in which we conduct business have imposed export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies  including some of the technologies used in our solutions 
changes in these or other laws or regulations could adversely affect our revenues 
a number of governments also have laws and regulations that govern technical specifications for the provision of our solutions 
changes in these laws or regulations could adversely affect the sales of  decrease the demand for and increase the cost of  our solutions 
for example  the federal communications commission may issue regulatory pronouncements from time to time that may mandate new standards for our equipment in the united states 
these pronouncements could require costly changes to our hardware and software 
additionally  certain government agencies currently require voip products to be certified through a lengthy testing process 
other government agencies may adopt similar lengthy certification procedures  which could delay the delivery of our products and adversely affect our revenues 
our netsolutions business unit relies on carriers to provide local and long distance services  including voice and data circuits  and mobile voice and data services to our customers and to provide us with billing information 
these services are subject to extensive and uncertain governmental regulation on both the federal and local level 
an increase or change in government regulation could restrict our ability to provide these services to our customers  which may have a material adverse affect on our business 
adverse resolution of litigation or governmental investigations may harm our operating results or financial condition 
we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business 
we may also be the subject of governmental investigations from time to time 
litigation and governmental investigations can be expensive  lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations 
moreover  the results of complex legal proceedings or governmental investigations are difficult to predict 
an unfavorable resolution of lawsuits or governmental investigations could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
see litigation in item of part i in this report 
we are exposed to risks inherent in our defined benefit pension plan 
we currently maintain a defined benefit pension plan for a number of our past and present employees in the united kingdom 
the plan was closed to new employees in june the contributions to fund benefit obligations under this plan are based on actuarial valuations  which themselves are based on assumptions and estimates about the long term operation of the plan  including employee turnover and retirement rates  the performance of the financial markets and interest rates 
if the actual operation of the plan differs from these assumptions  additional contributions by us may be required 
as of april   the projected benefit obligation of million exceeded the fair value of the plan assets of million  resulting in a pension liability of million 
in october  funding requirements under the plan were set for the three years commencing january  at of current pensionable salaries for current members plus annual payments totaling million pounds sterling towards the reduction of the accumulated deficit increasing by per annum for calendar year and 
our funding requirements for future years may increase from these current levels 
changes to pension legislation in the united kingdom may also adversely affect our funding requirements 

table of contents our future success depends on our existing key personnel 
our success is dependent upon the services of key personnel throughout our organization  including the members of our senior management and software and engineering staff  as well as the expertise of our directors 
competition for highly skilled directors  management  r d and other employees is intense in our industry and we may not be able to attract and retain highly qualified directors  management  and r d personnel and other employees in the future 
in order to improve productivity  a portion of our compensation to employees and directors is in the form of stock option grants  and as a consequence  a depression in the value of our common shares could make it difficult for us to motivate and retain employees and recruit additional qualified directors and personnel 
all of the foregoing may negatively impact our ability to retain or attract employees  which may adversely impact our ability to implement a management succession plan as and if required and on a timely basis 
we currently do not maintain corporate life insurance policies on the lives of our directors or any of our key employees 
the risks associated with sarbanes oxley regulatory compliance may have a material adverse effect on us

risks related to our common shares our stock price in the past has been volatile  and may continue to be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance  and investors may not be able to resell shares at or above the price at which they purchased the shares 
our stock has been publicly traded on the nasdaq global market for approximately two years 
at times  the stock price has been volatile 
the market price of our common shares may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors  many of which are beyond our control and which may be accentuated due to the relatively low average daily trading volume in our common shares 
the factors include fluctuations in the overall stock market  our quarterly operating results  sales of our common shares by principal security holders  the exercise of options and subsequent sales of shares by option holders  including those held by our senior management and other employees  departures of key personnel  future announcements concerning our or our competitors businesses  the failure of securities analysts to cover our company and or changes in financial forecasts and recommendations by securities analysts  a rating downgrade or other negative action by a ratings organization  actual or anticipated developments in our competitors businesses or the competitive landscape generally  litigation involving us  our industry or both  general market  economic and political conditions  regulatory developments  and natural disasters  terrorist attacks and acts of war

our articles of incorporation do not contain any provisions designed to facilitate resolution of actual or potential conflicts of interest  or to ensure that potential business opportunities that may become available to our principal investors and us will be reserved for or made available to us 
in addition  our significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common shares because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning shares in companies with controlling shareholders 
some of our directors have interests that may be different than our interests 
we do business with certain companies that are related parties  such as wesley clover and its subsidiaries 
wesley clover is controlled by dr 
matthews

our directors that serve on the boards of companies that we do business with also owe similar fiduciary duties to such other companies 
the duties owed to us could conflict with the duties such directors owe to these other companies 

table of contents ownership of our common shares by the francisco partners group and the matthews group as well as provisions contained in our articles of incorporation and in certain anti trust and foreign investment legislation  may reduce the likelihood of a change of control occurring and  as a consequence  may deprive shareholders of the opportunity to sell their common shares at a control premium 
the voting power of the francisco partners group and the matthews group  respectively  under certain circumstances could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control and may deprive our shareholders of the opportunity to sell their common shares at a control premium

our articles of incorporation permit us to issue an unlimited number of common and preferred shares 
limitations on the ability to acquire and hold our common shares may be imposed under the hart scott rodino act  the competition act canada and other applicable antitrust legislation 
such legislation generally permits the relevant governmental authorities to review any acquisition of control over or of significant interest in us  and grants the authority to challenge or prevent an acquisition on the basis that it would  or would be likely to  result in a substantial prevention or lessening of competition 
in addition  the investment canada act subjects an acquisition of control of a canadian business as those terms are defined therein by a non canadian to government review if the book value of the canadian business assets as calculated pursuant to the legislation exceeds a threshold amount 
a reviewable acquisition may not proceed unless the relevant minister is satisfied that the investment is likely to be of net benefit to canada

we are incorporated under the laws of canada  and our principal executive offices are located in canada 
a majority of our officers and certain of our directors named in this report reside principally in canada and a substantial portion of our assets and all or a substantial portion of the assets of these persons are located outside the united states 
consequently  it may not be possible for you to effect service of process within the united states upon us or those persons 
furthermore  it may not be possible for you to enforce judgments obtained in us courts based upon the civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws or other laws of the united states against us or those persons

the reconciliation of net income from discontinued operations to adjusted ebitda from discontinued operations consists of an adjustment for income tax expense of million  million  million  million and million for fiscal through fiscal  respectively 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss  adjusted for the items as noted in the above tables 
adjusted ebitda is not a measure calculated in accordance with us gaap 
adjusted ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income  income from operations or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with us gaap 
we prepare adjusted ebitda to eliminate the impact of items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance 
we encourage you to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate  as well as the material limitations of non gaap measures and the manner in which we compensate for those limitations 

table of contents we use adjusted ebitda as a measure of operating performance  for planning purposes  including the preparation of our annual operating budget  to allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of our business  and in communications with our board of directors concerning our financial performance 
we believe that the use of adjusted ebitda provides consistency and comparability of  and facilitates  period to period comparisons  and also facilitates comparisons with other companies in our industry  many of which use similar non gaap financial measures to supplement their us gaap results 
we believe adjusted ebitda may also be useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance because securities analysts use adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure to evaluate the overall operating performance of companies 
our investor and analyst presentations also include adjusted ebitda 
however  we also caution you that other companies in our industry may calculate adjusted ebitda or similarly titled measures differently than we do  which limits the usefulness of adjusted ebitda as a comparative measure 
moreover  although adjusted ebitda is frequently used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluations of companies  adjusted ebitda and similar non gaap measures have limitations as analytical tools  and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results of operations as reported under us gaap 
some of the limitations of adjusted ebitda are that it does not reflect interest income or interest expense  cash requirements for income taxes  foreign exchange gains or losses  significant cash payments made in connection with restructuring and litigation settlements  employee stock based compensation  cash requirements for the replacement of assets that have been depreciated or amortized  acquired in process research and development charges  and losses or gains related to the sale of manufacturing operations and other assets 
we compensate for the inherent limitations associated with using adjusted ebitda through disclosure of such limitations  presentation of our financial statements in accordance with us gaap and reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to the most directly comparable us gaap measure  net income loss

we refer to these ip telephony platforms and ucc applications as integrated communications solutions 
we believe that our solutions  which may include associated managed and network services  enable our customers to realize significant cost benefits and to conduct their business more effectively 
we have invested heavily in the research and development r d of our ip based communications solutions to take advantage of the telecommunications industry shift from traditional pbx systems to ip based communications solutions 
our r d has produced a global portfolio of over  patents and pending applications  and provides us with the expertise to anticipate market trends and meet the current and future needs of our customers 
we believe our early and sustained r d investment in ip based communications solutions has positioned us well to capitalize on the industry shift to ip based communications solutions 
netsolutions netsolutions is a us based communications service provider 
we focus on delivering leading telecommunications solutions to businesses with the following services mitel netsolutions for voice and data provides businesses with voice and data communication services and is a registered competitive local exchange carrier clec in all us states  mitel mobile solutions provides business class g and g wireless voice  text and internet services on a nationwide network  and mitel anyware provides a cloud based service that delivers business communications without the need to own and maintain a traditional phone system 
other our other division sells products and related services that complement the company s core unified communications offering 
prior to the third quarter of fiscal  the other segment was labeled datanet and consisted primarily of the now discontinued operations of the datanet business  as described below 
significant events and recent developments during fiscal  we began to actively market for sale our datanet and commsource business datanet  which distributes a wide variety of third party telephony and data products and related services 
as a result  at april   the assets of datanet have been classified and accounted for as held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets and the operating results have been reported on the consolidated statements of operation as discontinued operations 
although we anticipate that a sale will be completed within one year  we are in the process of identifying a purchaser and there is no assurance of when or if a sale will be completed 
prior to the third quarter of fiscal  the other segment was labeled datanet and consisted primarily of the operations of the datanet business 
in may  we reorganized our business into three business units mcs  netsolutions and other 
we believe this new organizational structure has simplified our business and allows us to better serve our customers and to better focus our research and 
table of contents development expenses 
as a result of the reorganization  we now present our segmented disclosures on a business unit basis 
in conjunction with reorganizing our business  our mcs business unit focused on a channel partner go to market business model beginning in may as a result our mcs channel partner revenue increased in fiscal  which more than offset an expected decline in our direct business 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we repaid million of principal on our first lien term loan  primarily relating to the annual required repayment of excess cash flow 
the excess cash flow repayment reduces the company s quarterly principal repayments under the first lien term loan to nil until maturity 
the company is still subject to an annual repayment of excess cash flow under the terms of the first lien credit agreement 
in addition  the proceeds from the issuance of equity or debt including proceeds received from the exercise of options  and proceeds from the sale of company assets  including the potential sale of datanet  may also be required to be used  in whole or in part  to make certain mandatory prepayments under the first lien credit agreement and  once the first lien term loan is repaid  under the second lien credit agreement 
operating results our revenues for the year ended april  were million  as compared to million for the year ended april  the increase in revenues is due primarily to an increase in sales from our mcs segment from stronger volumes in the us and the us our operating income increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in operating income was driven primarily by increased revenues and increased gross margin percentage in our mcs segment  partially offset by increased selling  general and administrative costs  as described below 
trends ip based communications businesses continue to migrate from legacy telephony networks to ip based environments  which can address their voice  data  video and business applications requirements within a single converged network 
the transition to ip based communications solutions provides significant benefits to businesses  including enhanced workforce productivity  reduced infrastructure costs and the creation of highly functional applications that can be distributed easily 
we have invested heavily and continue to innovate in ip based solutions and therefore believe we are well positioned to benefit from this transition 
the evolution to converged ip based networks has given rise to two important trends the transition from hardware based to software based communications solutions and the ability to deliver integrated ucc applications 
the transition to software based communications solutions provides operational cost benefits and the ability to integrate communications with other business processes and applications 
ucc allows business customers to move beyond basic fixed telephony and disparate communications tools toward integrated multi media communications and collaboration between users  wherever they may be located 
ucc includes the integrated use of various media and messaging  such as voice  video and data 
our leadership in software based communications solutions has provided us with the foundation for continued innovation in ip based communications and ucc 
we believe our comprehensive  integrated ip based communications offering provides our customers with significant flexibility  cost efficiency and enhanced employee productivity as they transition to converged ip based environments and ucc 
virtualization corporate data centers have experienced a significant increase in the use of virtualization technology as a strategy to reduce capital and operating expenses as well as providing improved business continuity solutions through new high availability architectures 
we believe that businesses can significantly benefit from the virtualization of ucc and ip based communication solutions by allowing these products to integrate fully with the data center infrastructure and related management processes and eliminating telecommunication specific infrastructure and processes 
our early investment in this technology across our product portfolio allows our customers to benefit using either our products on vmware or with our multi instance communications director micd product 
hosted  cloud based solutions smes are increasingly interested in outsourcing management of their communications requirements through managed service offerings 
managed services may include equipment  installation  ongoing support  network services  or various professional services 
managed services offerings allow businesses to focus on their core expertise and  in some cases  substitute what would otherwise be a large capital expenditure for a predictable operating expense 
we believe that we are well positioned to benefit from this trend through our hosted cloud based ucc offerings from netsolutions 
virtualization technology is also serving as the base for cloud computing solutions enabling businesses to benefit from data center outsourcing and data center elasticity where data center resources and associated services may be acquired and dispensed with  depending on a business s needs 

table of contents mobility as employees increasingly work from outside the office  they require technology tools that enable them to work efficiently  regardless of their location 
as a result  it environments are being challenged to be mobile device agnostic while continuing to provide a secure  yet seamless experience for employees and administrators 
our investments in various fixed mobile convergence solutions as well as virtualization and hosted  cloud based solutions allow us to provide solutions in an increasingly mobile environment 
key performance indicators key performance indicators that we use to manage our business and evaluate our financial results and operating performance include revenues  gross margins  operating costs  operating income loss  net income loss  cash flows from operations  and adjusted ebitda 
revenue performance is evaluated from both a reportable segment and geographical perspective 
we evaluate revenue performance by comparing the results to management forecasts and prior period performance 
gross margins  operating costs  operating income loss and net income loss are each evaluated by comparing our actual results against both management forecasts and prior period performance 
cash flow from operations is the key performance indicator with respect to cash flows 
as part of monitoring cash flow from operations  we also monitor our days sales outstanding  our inventory turns and our days expenses in payables outstanding 
adjusted ebitda  a non gaap measure  is evaluated by comparing actual results to management forecasts and prior period performance 
for a definition and explanation of adjusted ebitda  as well as a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income loss  see item  selected financial data 
in addition to the above indicators  from time to time  we also monitor performance in the following areas status of key customer contracts  the achievement of expected milestones of our key r d projects  and the achievement of our key strategic initiatives 
in an effort to ensure we are creating value for and maintaining strong relationships with our customers  we monitor the status of key customer contracts to monitor customer service levels 
with respect to our r d projects  we measure content  quality and timeliness against project plans 
sources of revenues and expenses the following describes our sources of revenues and expenses 
revenues and cost of revenues mcs our mcs segment generates revenues principally from the sale of integrated communications solutions to business customers 
our distribution network includes value added resellers  or channel partners  and a direct sales staff  or direct channel 
each integrated communication solution generally contains multiple elements  including software applications  appliances and desktop devices 
substantially all of the company s appliances and desktop devices have both software and non software components that function together to deliver the essential functionality of the integrated system product 
in addition the company generates revenues from post contract support on the solutions 
as a result of the adoption of new accounting guidance  for transactions entered into or materially modified on or after the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal  the company allocates the total arrangement consideration to each separable deliverable of an arrangement based upon the relative selling price of each deliverable and revenue is recognized upon delivery or completion of those deliverables 
had this method of revenue recognition been applied to transactions prior to the first quarter of fiscal  the change to our consolidated revenues would have been insignificant 
revenue related to post contract support  including technical support and unspecified when and if available software upgrades  is recognized ratably over the contract term 
in a transaction containing a sales type lease  hardware and software revenues are recognized at the present value of the payments allocated to the hardware and software lease elements 
we regularly sell the net rental payments from sales type leases to financial institutions with the income streams discounted at prevailing rates at the time of sale 
gains or losses resulting from the sale of net rental payments from leases are recorded as net sales within mcs revenues 

table of contents our standard warranty period extends months from the date of sale 
at the time product revenues are recognized  an accrual for estimated warranty costs is recorded as a component of cost of revenues based on prior claims experience 
we offer various cooperative marketing programs to assist our channel partners in marketing our products 
allowances for these programs are recorded as marketing expenses at the time of shipment based on contract terms and prior experience 
mcs cost of revenues is comprised of product and service costs 
product cost of revenues is primarily comprised of cost of goods purchased from third party electronics manufacturing services and inventory provisions  engineering costs  warranty costs and other supply chain management costs 
depreciation of property and equipment relating to cost of revenues is also included in cost of revenues expense 
service cost of revenues is primarily comprised of labor costs 
revenues and cost of revenues netsolutions netsolutions primarily provides voice and data network services and wireless services to business customers on our partners nationwide networks  which we bill on a monthly basis 
revenues from network services are recognized as the services are provided 
cost of revenues from network services are recognized as the costs are incurred 
revenues and cost of revenues other other revenues include product revenues and cost of revenues  recognized when the risk and rewards have transferred to the customer  and service revenues and cost of revenues  recognized as the services are provided and costs are incurred 
sales  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a expenses consist primarily of costs relating to our sales and marketing activities  including salaries and related expenses  advertising  trade shows and other promotional activities and materials  administrative and finance functions  legal and professional fees  insurance and other corporate and overhead expenses 
depreciation of property and equipment relating to sales and marketing activities is also included 
following the acquisition of inter tel in fiscal  sg a also includes significant amounts recorded for the amortization of purchased intangible assets 
research and development expenses r d expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for engineering personnel  materials and consumables and subcontract service costs 
depreciation and amortization of r d assets are included in r d expenses 
special charges and restructuring costs special charges relate to restructuring activities  product line exits and other loss accruals undertaken to improve our operational efficiency 
special charges consist primarily of workforce reduction costs  lease termination obligations and asset write offs 
we reassess the accruals at each reporting period to reflect changes in the timing or amount of estimated restructuring and termination costs on which the original estimates were based 
new restructuring accruals or reversals of previous accruals are recorded in the period of change 
comparability of periods our functional currency is the us dollar and our consolidated financial statements are prepared with us dollar reporting currency using the current rate method 
assets and liabilities of non us operations are translated from foreign currencies into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date while revenue and expense items are translated at the monthly average exchange rates for the relevant period 
the resulting unrealized gains and losses have been included as part of the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment which is reported as other comprehensive income 
as a result  changes in foreign exchange rates from period to period can have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial position  which also makes the comparability of periods complex 
in conjunction with the may reorganization of our business  we reviewed the classification of certain costs against their nature and the classification of the costs of comparable companies 
in doing so  we concluded that it would be appropriate to reclassify certain costs to provide enhanced and more comparable information 
the nature of the reclassifications is described in note to the audited consolidated financial statements

future changes in estimates of taxable income could result in a significant change to the valuation allowance 
during fiscal  there was no change in the assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
at april  we concluded that a substantial valuation allowance was appropriate due to the uncertainty surrounding the company s ability to earn taxable income in certain jurisdictions 
excluding changes in valuation allowance  we recorded a net income tax benefit of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the fiscal tax recovery was due primarily to the use of losses not previously recognized  which was partially offset by the tax effect of temporary differences  related to differences in accounting and tax treatment pertaining primarily to the leasing portfolio and other accruals

due to the nature of our sales agreements  judgment is routinely applied in the area of unbundling of multiple element arrangements using the relative selling price hierarchy 
in particular  to determine the relative selling price of each element in a multiple element arrangement  we first determine whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price exists for each element 
where vsoe of selling price does not exist for an element  we then look to third party evidence of selling price 
however  third party evidence is not generally available as our product offerings differ from those of our competitors and competitor pricing is often not available 
in such cases where vsoe and third party evidence cannot establish a selling price  we estimate the selling price for an element by determining the price at which we would transact if the products or services were to be sold on a standalone basis 
in establishing the estimated selling price  management judgment is involved and we consider a number of factors including  but not limited to  geographies  customer segments and pricing practices 
sales type leases in a sales type lease transaction  hardware revenues are recognized at the present value of the payments allocated to the equipment lease element at the time of system sale 
the costs of systems installed under these sales type leases are recorded as costs of sales 
the net rental streams are sold to financial institutions on a regular basis with the income streams discounted by prevailing like term rates at the time of sale 
gains or losses resulting from the resale of net rental payments from such leases are recorded as net sales 
we establish and maintain reserves against potential recourse following the sale of sales type leases based upon historical loss experience  past due accounts and specific account analysis 
the allowance for uncollectible minimum lease payments and recourse liability at the end of the year represents reserves against the entire lease portfolio 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance on a regular basis and adjusts the allowance as required 
these reserves are either netted in the accounts receivable  netted in the current and long term components of net investments in sales type leases on the balance sheet  or  for off balance sheet leases  recorded as a lease recourse liability and included in long term liabilities on our balance sheet 
our total reserve for losses related to the entire lease portfolio  including amounts classified as accounts receivable on our balance sheet was of the ending aggregate lease portfolio as of april  compared to at april  the reserve is based on a review past write off experience and a review of the accounts receivable aging as of april  we believe our reserves are adequate to cover future potential write offs 
should  however  the financial condition of our customers deteriorate in the future  additional reserves in amounts that could be material to the financial statements could be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectability of customer accounts 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in order to make this assessment including a detailed analysis of the aging of our accounts receivable and the current credit worthiness of our customers and an analysis of historical bad debts and other adjustments 
if there is a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  our estimate of the recoverability of amounts due could be adversely affected 
we review in detail our allowance for doubtful accounts on a quarterly basis and adjust the allowance amount estimate to reflect actual portfolio performance and change in future portfolio performance expectations 
as of april  and april   the provision represented and of gross receivables  respectively 
the decrease in reserve level at april  was due primarily to an increased likelihood of collection of certain receivables that were individually evaluated for impairment at april   as well as write offs of accounts receivable in fiscal that were provided for at april  goodwill we assess goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if circumstances warrant 
an impairment charge is recorded if the implied fair value of goodwill of a reporting unit is less than the book value of goodwill for that unit 
at april   our reporting units for goodwill allocation purposes were based on geographic units the us  canada and cala  emea and asia pacific 
on may   as discussed in the significant events and recent developments under the overview section above  we reorganized our business into three business units 
these business units became our operating segments and  in addition  our reporting units for goodwill impairment testing 
as a result  we reallocated our total goodwill to each new business unit on a relative fair value basis 
at may   our total goodwill of million was allocated as follows million to our mcs segment  million to our netsolutions segment and million to the now discontinued operations of datanet 
at april   the goodwill associated with datanet is recorded as assets of component held for sale  non current on our consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents quoted stock market prices are not available for these individual reporting units 
accordingly  our methodology for estimating the fair value of each reporting unit primarily considers estimated future revenues and cash flows for those reporting units along with many other assumptions 
our valuation approach includes a detailed valuation analysis of both the company as a whole and the reporting units 
in performing the annual goodwill impairment test we considered three generally accepted approaches for valuing a business the income  market and cost approaches 
based on the nature of our business and the reporting units current and expected financial performance  we determined that the market approach was the most appropriate methods for estimating the fair value of the us reporting unit under the first step of the analysis 
for the market approach  we analyzed the valuation indicators that our market capitalization implies  including enterprise value to ebitda 
consideration of these factors inherently involves a significant amount of judgment  and significant changes in the underlying assumptions used may result in fluctuations in the value of goodwill that is supported 
the result of the most recent annual impairment test  performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal  resulted in no impairment charge 
the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 
the fiscal and fiscal annual impairment tests  performed on a geographic unit basis  also resulted in no impairment charge 
erosion in capital markets  material reductions in our expected cash flow forecasts  significant reductions in our market capitalization or a significant decline in economic conditions  in addition to changes to the underlying assumptions used in our valuation approach described above  could all lead to future impairment in goodwill 
special charges we record restructuring  exit and other loss accruals when the liability has been incurred 
these charges relate primarily to workforce reductions and lease termination obligations estimates used to establish lease termination obligations have been reduced for sublease income that we believe is probable 
because we are required to project sublease income for many years into the future  management used considerable judgment in determining certain estimates relating to the timing  availability and amount of sublease income that we expect to receive as of april   the liability relating to lease termination obligations was million  with million recorded as current april  total of million  with million recorded as current 
this estimate will change as a result of actual results  the passage of time and changes in assumptions regarding vacancy  market rate  and operating costs 
deferred taxes we have significant net deferred tax assets resulting from operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences that may reduce taxable income in future periods 
valuation allowances have been established for deferred tax assets based on a more likely than not threshold 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income  and to the extent that recovery is not believed to be more likely than not  a valuation allowance is recorded 
future changes in estimates of taxable income could result in a significant change to the valuation allowance 
in fiscal  we updated our assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
based primarily on stronger operating performance in fiscal  we determined that it was more likely than not that we would realize a benefit from an additional portion of our deferred tax assets in canada 
as a result  we relieved a valuation allowance of approximately million  primarily relating to the deferred tax assets in canada 
at april   as a result of uncertainty regarding the future utilization of certain deferred tax assets  there continues to be a valuation allowance of million against deferred tax assets primarily in the united kingdom april  valuation allowance of million against deferred tax assets in canada and the united kingdom 
in fiscal  we updated our assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
based on a number of factors  including completion of a reorganization of certain subsidiaries  cumulative income for the previous months and forecasted income excluding non recurring items  we determined that the weight of the evidence indicated that it was now more likely than not that we would realize a benefit from a significant portion of our deferred tax assets in canada 
as a result  we relieved a valuation allowance of approximately million  primarily relating to the deferred tax assets in canada 
numerous taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which we do business are increasing their scrutiny of various tax positions taken by businesses 
we believe that we maintain adequate tax reserves to offset the potential tax liabilities that may arise upon audit in these jurisdictions 
if such amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary  the resulting reversal of such reserves would result in tax benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed necessary 
if such amounts ultimately prove to be less than the ultimate assessment  a future charge to expense would result 

table of contents pension costs we currently maintain a defined benefit pension plan for a number of our past and present employees in the united kingdom 
the plan was closed to new employees in june our defined benefit pension costs are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions provided by us to the actuaries  including discount rates  expected return on plan assets and rate of compensation increases 
in estimating the rates and returns  we consider current market conditions and anticipate how these will affect discount rates  expected returns and rates of compensation increases 
material changes in our pension benefit costs may occur in the future as a result of changes to these assumptions or from fluctuations in our related headcount or market conditions 
in fiscal  our pension liability increased by million to million from million at april  this increase was primarily due to the actual return on our plan assets being below our expected return  in addition to an increase in the benefit obligation as a result of a decrease in the discount rate to from due to macro economic conditions 
in fiscal  our pension liability decreased by million to million from million at april  this decrease was the result of our funding contributions and actual return on plan assets being higher than the expected return  partially offset by a strengthening of the british pound sterling against the us dollar 
we did not make any significant changes in our actuarial assumptions in fiscal stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation expense in accordance with the stock compensation topic of the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc 
the fair value of the stock options granted is estimated on the grant date using the black scholes option pricing model for each award  net of estimated forfeitures  and is recognized over the employee s requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
we have estimated the volatility of our common shares using the historical volatility of comparable public companies 
we determine the comparable public companies based on a number of factors including similarity to us with respect to industry  business model  stage of growth and financial risk 
the selection of comparable public companies requires significant management judgment and a change in the volatility assumption could significantly affect the determination of stock based compensation expense 
we expect to continue to use the historical volatility of comparable companies until our historical volatility as a publicly traded company is sufficiently established to measure expected volatility for option grants 
based on these assumptions  stock based compensation expense reduced our results of operations by million for the year ended april  year ended april  million  million 
as of april   there was approximately million of unrecognized stock based compensation expense related to non vested stock option awards april  million 
we expect these awards to be recognized over a weighted average period of years april  years 
recent accounting pronouncements recent accounting pronouncements adopted in fiscal revenue recognition in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu to address concerns raised by constituents relating to the accounting for revenue arrangements that contain tangible products and software 
the amendments in this asu change the accounting model for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements 
tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the tangible product s essential functionality are no longer within the scope of guidance in the software revenue recognition subtopic of the fasb asc 
in october  the fasb also issued asu to address the accounting for multiple deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services deliverables separately rather than as a combined unit 
this asu provides amendments to the criteria in the revenue recognition multiple element arrangements subtopic of the fasb asc 
the asu allows the establishment of the relative value of deliverables using management estimates of selling price when vsoe and third party evidence cannot be obtained 
this new accounting guidance became applicable for us beginning with the first quarter of fiscal we prospectively adopted this guidance for transactions that were entered into  or materially modified  on or after may  this guidance did not generally change the units of accounting for our revenue transactions  as most of our products and services qualified as separate units of accounting under the previous guidance 

table of contents for transactions entered into or materially modified on or after the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal  we allocate the total arrangement consideration to each separable deliverable of an arrangement based upon the relative selling price of each deliverable and revenue is recognized upon delivery or completion of those units of accounting 
the relative selling price is determined using vsoe when available 
in the event that vsoe of selling price cannot be established  we attempt to determine the selling price for the deliverables using third party evidence 
third party evidence can be determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately by the competitors 
generally  our product offerings differ from those of our competitors and comparable pricing is often not available 
if we are unable to establish selling price using vsoe or third party evidence  we use estimated selling price for the allocation of arrangement fees 
the estimated selling price for a deliverable is determined as the price at which we would transact if the products or services were to be sold on a standalone basis  and involves management estimates 
if the transactions entered into or materially modified on or after may  were subject to previous accounting guidance  the change to total revenues and deferred revenues would be insignificant to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended april  fair value measurement in may  the fasb issued asu fair value measurement amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
we adopted this asu in the fourth quarter of fiscal the adoption did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements to be adopted in fiscal other comprehensive income in june  the fasb issued asu to improve the comparability  consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of comprehensive income 
the asu provides amendments to the comprehensive income subtopic of the fasb asc  such that comprehensive income must be presented in a single continuous statement with net income  or in a separate  but consecutive  statement 
we are required to adopt this asu in the first quarter of fiscal we expect to report a separate  but consecutive  statement of comprehensive income in the first quarter of fiscal goodwill impairment tests in september  the fasb issued asu to reduce the cost and complexity of goodwill impairment tests by providing entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary 
we are required to adopt this asu for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed  beginning in fiscal we do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss in our future earnings due to adverse changes in financial markets 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in our common share price  foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
inflation has not had a significant impact on our results of operations 
foreign currency risk we are exposed to currency rate fluctuations related primarily to our future net cash flows from operations in canadian dollars  british pounds sterling and euros 
when possible  we use foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short term impact of currency fluctuations on foreign currency receivables  payables and intercompany balances 
these contracts are not entered into for speculative purposes  and are not treated as hedges for accounting purposes 
foreign currency contracts are recorded at fair market value 
the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
as of april   a appreciation in the us dollar against all currencies would have resulted in an additional unrealized gain of million on those foreign currency forward contracts 
as at april   a depreciation in the us dollar against all currencies would have resulted in an additional unrealized loss of million on those foreign currency forward contracts 
interest rate risk in accordance with our corporate policy  cash equivalent and short term investment balances are primarily comprised of high grade commercial paper and money market instruments with original maturity dates of less than three months 
due to the short term maturity of these investments  we are not subject to significant interest rate risk 
we are exposed to interest rate risk on our million revolving credit facility  which currently bears interest at a rate of libor plus and expires in august if the entire revolving credit facility were utilized  each adverse change in the libor rate of would currently result in an additional million in interest expense per year 
at april   no amount was outstanding under the revolving facility 
we are exposed to interest rate risk on the million liability outstanding on april  under our first lien term loan which matures on august  and bears interest at a rate of libor plus and the million liability outstanding on april  under our second lien term loan which matures on august  and bears interest at a rate of libor plus 
the impact of each adverse change in the libor rate of on the first lien term loan and the second lien term loan  in aggregate  would result in an additional million in interest expense per year 
the interest rates on our obligations under capital leases are fixed and therefore not subject to interest rate risk 
credit risk our financial assets that are exposed to credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents  accounts receivable  other receivables and our sales type lease receivables 
in addition  we are exposed to credit risk through our recourse obligations on sold sales type leases 
cash equivalents are invested in government and commercial paper with investment grade credit rating 
we are exposed to normal credit risk from customers 
however  we have a large number of diverse customers to minimize concentrations of credit risk
