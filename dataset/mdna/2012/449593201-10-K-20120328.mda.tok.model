item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our selected consolidated financial data and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in this report 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements 
our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in these forward looking statements 
please see the disclosure concerning forward looking statements and risk factors above for a discussion of factors that may affect our future results 
overview we are a leading provider of innovative accessories and power management solutions for the electronics industry 
our vision is to attach our products and technology to every mobile electronic device 
increased functionality and the ability to access and manage information remotely are driving the proliferation of mobile electronic devices and applications 
the popularity of these devices is increasing due to reductions in size  weight and cost and improvements in functionality  storage capacity and reliability 
each of these devices needs to be powered and connected when in the home  the office  or on the road  and can be accessorized  representing opportunities for one or more of our products 
we design and develop products that make computers and mobile electronic devices more efficient and cost effective  thus enabling professionals and consumers higher utilization of their mobile devices and the ability to access information more readily 
our current product offering primarily consists of power  batteries  audio and protection solutions for mobile electronic devices  and we intend to continue to introduce new accessories for mobile electronic devices 
power the centerpiece of our power management solutions is our proprietary igo green technology 
our first igo green products are laptop chargers and surge protectors that incorporate our new patented technology 
our igo green technology reduces energy consumption and almost completely eliminates standby power  or vampire power 
we believe that this power saving technology will help us achieve our long term goal of establishing an industry standard for reduced power consumption when charging mobile electronic devices 
batteries through our relationship with pure energy solutions pure energy  we are the exclusive marketer and distributor of pure energy s patented rechargeable alkaline ramcell batteries to retailers worldwide excluding china with non exclusive distribution rights in africa 
ramcell batteries are pre charged and hold a charge for up to seven years 
approximately three billion single use alkaline batteries are sold annually in the united states 
ramcell batteries provide users an environmentally friendly  cost effective alternative to disposable alkaline batteries 
we believe that ramcell batteries and related battery chargers are complementary to our power saving technology and contribute to lower levels of electronic waste 
audio as a result of our acquisition of aerial industries  inc aerial  we now offer a line of earbuds and headphones 
as mobile phones have recently evolved into smartphones and the introduction of new portable media devices  all of which are capable of playing music and video  many consumers utilize a variety of mobile electronic devices for both communication and entertainment purposes 
our audio products are uniquely designed to provide enhanced sound quality compared to competitive products at similar price points 
our line of 
table of contents audio products also offer consumers the ability to both communicate with others via an integrated microphone that can be used with a portable computer  mobile phone  computer or other portable media device as well the ability to listen to music or video from these devices 
similar to our protection products and in addition to the quality sound output delivered by our audio products  our line of audio products is also fashionably designed  allowing consumers to express their unique and personal style 
currently  these products are offered primarily through lifestyle and music retailers around the world  however we intend to expand our audio product offering and introduce these and similar products in consumer electronics retailers around the world as well 
protection as a result of our acquisition of adapt mobile limited adapt  we now offer a line of skins  cases and screen protectors for mobile electronic devices 
consumers value the protection of their mobile electronic devices as they rely on them heavily in their daily lives to both connect with others and store important information 
in addition  consumers often view these products as a way to express their personal fashion and style  similar to clothing and other accessories 
our line of protection products is designed to meet both of these consumer needs by providing the consumer with a high degree of protection  while simultaneously offering them a unique fashionable design that fits their personal style 
currently  we offer these products primarily in europe  however we expect to expand our line of cases  skins  screen protectors and other similar products and introduce them in other markets throughout the world 
our ability to execute successfully on our near and long term objectives depends largely upon the general market acceptance of our power  protection and audio products  our ability to protect our unique proprietary rights  including notable our igo green technology  our ability to generate additional major customers  and general economic conditions 
additionally  we must execute on the customer relationships that we have developed and continue to design  develop  manufacture and market new and innovative technology and products that are embraced by these customers and the overall market 
recent developments on february   we received a letter from the nasdaq stock market nasdaq indicating that the bid price of our common stock for the last consecutive business days had closed below the minimum per share required for continued listing under nasdaq marketplace rule a 
this notification has no effect on the listing of the our common stock at this time 
the notification letter states that we have calendar days to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement 
in order to regain compliance  the closing bid price for our ordinary shares must be at least per share for a minimum of consecutive business days 
the compliance period expires on august  at the close of the grace period  if we have not regained compliance  we may be eligible for an additional grace period of days  if we meet the initial listing standards  with the exception of bid price  for the nasdaq capital market and we provide nasdaq with a notice of our intention to timely cure the bid price deficiency 
if we are not eligible for an additional grace period  we will receive notification that our securities are subject to delisting  and we may then appeal the delisting determination to a nasdaq hearings panel 
we intend to monitor the bid price for our ordinary shares between now and august  and will consider available options to resolve the deficiency and regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to regain compliance with the nasdaq rules and thereby to maintain the listing of our common stock on the nasdaq stock market 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally 
table of contents accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make a number of estimates and judgments which impact the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debt expense  warranty obligations  inventories  sales returns and price protection  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
revenue from product sales is generally recognized upon shipment and transfer of ownership from us or our contract manufacturers to our customers 
allowances for sales returns and credits are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded 
should the actual return or sales credit rates differ from our estimates  revisions to our estimated allowance for sales returns and credits may be required 
our recognition of revenue from product sales to distributors  resellers and retailers  or the retail and distribution channel  is affected by agreements we have with certain customers giving them rights to return up to of their prior quarter s purchases  provided that the customer places a new order for an equal or greater dollar value of the amount returned 
we also have agreements with certain customers that allow them to receive credit for subsequent price reductions  or price protection 
at the time we recognize revenue related to these agreements  we reduce revenue for the gross sales value of estimated future returns  as well as our estimate of future price protection 
we also reduce cost of revenue for the gross product cost of estimated future returns 
we record an allowance for sales returns in the amount of the difference between the gross sales value and the cost of revenue as a reduction of accounts receivable 
we also have agreements with certain customers that provide them with a right of return prior to the ultimate sale to an end user of the product 
accordingly  we have recorded deferred revenue of  as of december  and  as of december   which we expect to recognize as revenue when the product is sold to the end user 
gross sales to the retail and distribution channel accounted for approximately of revenue for the year ended december  and of revenue for the year ended december  historically  a correlation has existed between the amount of retail and distribution channel inventory and the amount of returns that actually occur 
the greater the inventory held by our distributors  the more product returns we expect 
as part of our effort to reach an appropriate accounting estimate for returns  for each of our products  we monitor levels of product sales and inventory at our distributors warehouses and at retailers 
in estimating returns  we analyze historical returns  current inventory in the retail and distribution channel  current economic trends  changes in consumer demand  the introduction of new competing products and market acceptance of our products 
in recent years  as a result of a combination of the factors described above  we have reduced our gross sales to reflect our estimated amounts of returns and price protection 
it is possible that returns could increase rapidly and significantly in the future 
accordingly  estimating product returns requires significant management judgment 
in addition  different return estimates that we reasonably could have used could have had a material impact on our reported sales and thus could have had a material impact on the presentation of the results of operations 
for these reasons  we believe that the accounting estimate related to product returns and price protection is a critical accounting estimate 
inventory valuation 
inventories consist of finished goods and component parts purchased both partially and fully assembled 
we experience all the typical risks and rewards of inventory held by contract manufacturers 

table of contents inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
inventories include material  labor and overhead costs 
labor and overhead costs are allocated to inventory based on a percentage of material costs 
we monitor usage reports to determine if the carrying value of any items should be adjusted due to lack of demand 
we make a downward adjustment to the value of our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
deferred tax valuation allowance 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in determining the amount of the valuation allowance  we consider estimated future taxable income as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate 
historically  we have recorded a deferred tax valuation allowance in an amount equal to our net deferred tax assets 
if we determine that we will ultimately be able to utilize all or a portion of deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been provided  the related portion of the valuation allowance will be released to income as a credit to income tax expense 
during  we released  of the valuation allowance relating to an application for a refund of federal alternative minimum taxes paid in and in connection with the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of during  we released  of the valuation allowance as a result of deferred tax liabilities incurred in connection with the acquisitions of adapt and aerial goodwill and long lived asset valuation 
we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of october the goodwill impairment evaluation process is based on both a discounted future cash flows approach and a market comparable approach 
the discounted cash flows approach uses our estimates of future market growth rates  market share  revenue and costs  as well as appropriate discount rates 
we evaluated goodwill for impairment as of october  and determined that recorded goodwill was impaired at that time 
we test our recorded long lived assets whenever events indicate the recorded intangible assets may be impaired 
our long lived asset impairment approach is based on an undiscounted cash flows approach 
as a result of the assessment of goodwill impairment at october   we tested long lived assets for impairment at that time and determined some of these assets were impaired 
we have recorded long lived asset impairment charges in the past  and if we fail to achieve our assumed growth rates or assumed gross margin  we may incur additional charges for impairment in the future 
for these reasons  we believe that the accounting estimates related to goodwill and long lived assets are critical accounting estimates 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated financial data for the periods indicated expressed as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated year ended december  as recast revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative asset impairment total operating expenses loss from operations other income expense interest income  net gain on disposal of assets and other income  net loss before income tax income tax benefit net income loss comparison of years ended december    and revenue 
revenue generally consists of sales of products  net of returns and allowances 
to date  our revenues have come predominantly from our laptop chargers 
the following table summarizes the year over year comparison of our consolidated revenue for the periods indicated dollars in thousands year annual amount decrease from prior year percentage change from prior year following is a breakdown of revenue by significant account for the years ended december   and with corresponding dollar and percent changes dollars in millions change from to change from to change change change change walmart radioshack belkin targus all other customers 
table of contents the decrease in revenue was primarily due to the decreases in sales to radioshack and belkin  as indicated in the table above  as a result of a shift in radioshack s retail strategy to place greater emphasis on its own private label brands  pointmobl and enercell during this decrease in revenue was partially offset by the addition of battery  audio and protection product lines as a result of adapt and aerial acquisitions in the second half of and the establishment of our pure energy relationship in the first quarter of  combined with increases in sales to walmart as indicated in the table above 
the battery  audio and protection product lines contributed million to revenue for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december   and the corresponding revenue is included in the table above under the caption all other customers 
we are working to continue to broaden our distribution base during with the goal of reducing our dependence on sales to walmart and radioshack in the future 
the decrease in revenue was primarily due to decreases in sales to targus and radioshack 
as noted in the table above  sales to targus decreased to for the year ended december  as a result of the termination of our sales agreement with targus in sales to radioshack also decreased to million for the year ended december  this decrease in sales was concurrent with radioshack s debut of its own private label chargers 
these decreases have been offset somewhat by sales to new retail customers such as walmart as well as increases in sales to other retailers and distributors as a result of our increased focus on sales to retailers and distributors 
sales to walmart increased to million for the year ended december  cost of revenue  gross profit and gross margin 
cost of revenue generally consists of costs associated with components  outsourced manufacturing and in house labor associated with assembly  testing  packaging  shipping and quality assurance  depreciation of equipment and indirect manufacturing costs 
gross profit is the difference between revenue and cost of revenue 
gross margin is gross profit stated as a percentage of revenue 
the following tables summarize the year over year comparison of our cost of revenue  gross profit and gross margin for the periods indicated dollars in thousands cost of revenue year cost of revenue increase decrease from prior year percentage change from prior year gross profit and gross margin year gross profit gross margin decrease in gross profit from prior year percentage change from prior year total dollars the increase in cost of revenue and corresponding decrease in gross margin was due primarily to a decrease in average direct margin  which excludes labor and overhead costs  to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december   as a result of increased product costs  reduced sales prices and shifts in product mix 
also contributing to the increase in cost of revenue and the corresponding decrease in gross margin was an increase in labor and overhead costs  which are mostly fixed  of  or to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in labor and overhead costs during was primarily due to increases of  in third party logistics costs   in allowances for excess and obsolete inventory  and  in cycle count adjustments 
as a result of these factors  cost of revenue  as a percentage of revenue  
table of contents increased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  we continue to see increases in component costs from our primary asian suppliers combined with increased competition and lower sales prices for our power products  and as a result  we expect gross margins to remain the same or decline slightly in compared to the decrease in cost of revenue was primarily due to the decrease in revenue discussed above 
the increase in gross margin was due primarily to an increase in average direct margin  which excludes labor and overhead costs to for the year ended december  compared to as recast for the year ended december   primarily as a result in the decline of sales of products to private label resellers which typically result in lower margins  combined with an increase in sales to retailers relative to total revenue 
partially offsetting the increase in direct margin was an increase in labor and overhead costs 
labor and overhead costs  which are mostly fixed  increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million as recast for the year ended december  as a result of these factors  cost of revenue  as a percentage of revenue  decreased to for the year ended december  from as recast for the year ended december  sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses generally consist of salaries  commissions and other personnel related costs of our sales  marketing and support personnel  advertising  public relations  promotions  printed media and travel 
the following table summarizes the year over year comparison of our sales and marketing expenses for the periods indicated dollars in thousands year annual amount increase decrease from prior year percentage change from prior year the decrease in sales and marketing expenses primarily resulted from decreases in advertising and market research expenses 
specifically  marketing and advertising expenses decreased  or  to  for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in personnel related and consulting expenses of  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  sales and marketing expenses increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in sales and marketing expenses primarily resulted from increased personnel  consulting and sales commissions  and product samples and advertising 
specifically  personnel  sales commissions and consulting fees increased  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million as recast for the year ended december  advertising and sample costs increased by  or to million for the year ended december  compared to  as recast for the year ended december  partially offsetting these increases was a reduction in trade show expense of  or  to  for the year ended december   compared to  as recast for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  sales and marketing expenses increased to for the year ended december  from as recast for the year ended december  research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and personnel related costs  outside consulting  lab costs and travel related costs of our product development group 
the following table summarizes the year over year comparison of our research and development expenses for the periods indicated dollars in thousands year annual amount increase decrease from prior year percentage change from prior year 
table of contents the increase in research and development expenses in resulted primarily from the increases of approximately  in personnel related expenses  or to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   primarily due to the addition of personnel from the adapt and aerial acquisitions and severance payments associated with a reduction in personnel 
non recurring engineering expenses increased by  or to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  primarily due to the development of our power saving microchip with texas instruments 
professional consulting expenses increased by  or to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  research and development expenses increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease in research and development expenses in resulted primarily from a decline of product certification  research and prototyping related expenses  and personnel and consulting related expenses 
specifically  product certification  research and prototyping related expenses decreased by  or to  for the year ended december   compared to  as recast for the year ended december  personnel and consulting related expenses decreased by  or to million for the year ended december   compared to million as recast for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  research and development expenses decreased to for the year ended december  from as recast for the year ended december  general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses of our finance  human resources  information systems  corporate development and other administrative personnel  as well as facilities  legal and other professional fees  depreciation and amortization and related expenses 
the following table summarizes the year over year comparison of our general and administrative expenses for the periods indicated dollars in thousands year annual amount increase decrease from prior year percentage change from prior year the increase in general and administrative expenses resulted from increases in equity compensation and amortization expenses of approximately  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   primarily due to the adapt and aerial acquisitions 
partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in personnel related expenses of approximately  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of revenue increased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the decrease in general and administrative expenses primarily result from decreases to personnel and consulting related expenses 
specifically  personnel and consulting related expenses decreased by  or to million for the year ended december   compared to million as recast for the year ended december  partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in non cash equity compensation and shareholder services expense 
non cash equity compensation and shareholder services expense increased by  or to million for the year ended december   compared to million as recast for the year ended december  primarily as a result of an increase in non cash equity awards granted during general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of revenue increased to for the year ended december   from as recast for the year ended december  asset impairment 
asset impairment expense consists of expenses associated with impairment write downs of goodwill and amortizable intangible assets 
as of october   our annual impairment testing date  as a 
table of contents result of a significant decline in our overall market capitalization  we determined goodwill in the amount of  related to our acquisition of adapt mobile and million related to our acquisition of aerial was impaired 
in conjunction with the goodwill impairment  we determined a triggering event had occurred that caused us to evaluate amortizable assets related to adapt and aerial for impairment 
based on lower than anticipated sales of protection products  we determined amortizable intangible assets with a remaining net book value of  related to adapt were impaired 
we determined the amortizable intangible assets recorded in connection with the aerial acquisition were not impaired 
a total asset impairment charge of million related to the impairment of goodwill and amortizable intangible assets was recorded for the year ended december  we also evaluated goodwill for impairment as of october   and determined goodwill was not impaired as of that date 
accordingly  no asset impairment charge was recorded for the year ended december  we had no goodwill in interest income  net 
interest income  net consists primarily of interest earned on our cash balances and short term investments 
the following table summarizes the year over year comparison of interest income  net for the periods indicated dollars in thousands year annual amount decrease from prior year percentage change from prior year the decrease in interest income was primarily due to collection in full of notes receivable during and decreased short term investment balances during due to usage of those investments to fund operating losses and working capital requirements 
the average yield on our cash and short term investments at december  was less than  consistent with the average yield in the decrease in interest income was primarily due to the use of cash to fund acquisitions 
at december   the average yield on our cash and short term investments was less than  consistent with the average yield in gain loss on disposal of assets and other income  net 
gain loss on disposal of assets and other income  net consists of the net proceeds received from the disposal of assets  less the remaining net book value of the disposed assets and other income in connection with the collection of notes receivable that had been previously deferred in connection with the sale of the assets of our handheld software and hardware product lines 
the following table summarizes the year over year comparison of gain on disposal of assets for the periods indicated dollars in thousands year annual amount increase decrease from prior year percentage change from prior year the gain was due primarily to the reversal of valuation allowances against notes receivable from mission and cradlepoint 
the note receivable from mission was originally issued in connection with its purchase of the assets of our expansion and docking product line in april and subsequently repaid in full in april  which resulted in the reversal of a valuation allowance and corresponding recognition of a gain of  the note receivable from cradlepoint was originally issued in connection with its purchase of the assets of our handheld connectivity product line in february subsequent to december   the note  which had an uncollected balance of  was paid in full 
since the note was deemed collectible  the related valuation allowance was reversed and the company recognized the remaining  of gain related to the transaction 

table of contents income taxes 
based on historical operating losses and projections for future taxable income  it is more likely than not that we will not fully realize the benefits of the net operating loss carryforwards 
we have not  therefore  recorded a tax benefit from our net operating loss carryforwards for the year ended december   which at december  was million 
as the result of the acquisitions of adapt and aerial  we recorded a  tax benefit for the year ended december  the tax benefit relates to a deferred tax liability resulting from acquired intangible assets that are not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes 
as our deferred tax assets  net of deferred tax liabilities  are fully valued at zero  the impact of recording this deferred tax liability resulted in a release of a portion of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance  and is recorded as income tax benefit for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we filed form  corporation application for tentative refund  to claim a refund of alternative minimum taxes paid for the year ended december  pursuant to the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of  passed on november  as a result  we recorded an income tax benefit of  for the year ended december  operating outlook we have historically generated the majority of our revenue from the sale of chargers for laptops  however  consumers are increasingly using smartphones and tablets as their primary mobile electronic devices 
as a result of this shift  we have seen increased competition and a decline in demand for our power products with our traditional customer base 
for example  during  we faced increased competition from retail customers who began offering traditional power products under their own private label brands  including most notably radioshack 
although we have expanded our offering of products beyond our traditional power products to include a variety of accessories to support the increased utilization of smartphones and tablets  including audio  protection  and battery products  the revenue generated from the sales of these products has not yet offset the decline in revenue from historical sales of our traditional power products 
nevertheless  as a result of the diversification of our product offering combined with the continued sales of our traditional power products  we expect our total revenue to be more than our revenue 
we expect to continue to introduce additional mobile electronics accessory products in the future as we execute on our vision to attach our products and technology to every mobile electronic device 
in order to continue to grow our business and enhance shareholder value  we believe it is necessary to continue to expand our product portfolio 
moving forward  we intend to continue to explore a number of initiatives designed to broaden our product portfolio within the mobile electronics accessories space 
we currently plan that the initiatives will consist of internal product development  sourcing products from third parties  joint marketing ventures  product bundling  licensing opportunities  and acquisitions of complementary and synergistic product families and companies 
we also have initiatives to expand our distribution beyond consumer retail with the intent to sell products into the enterprise  government and education channels 
all of these initiatives are designed to leverage the inherent strengths of our business  most notably  our strong balance sheet  our compelling portfolio of intellectual property  and our established brand and relationships with major retailers 
as we continue to execute on this vision  we believe we can improve our ability to drive higher levels of revenue and earnings  which will ultimately have a positive impact on value creation for our shareholders 
we continue to see increases in component costs from our primary asian suppliers combined with pricing pressure from our customers  most notably from walmart 
however  we expect the cost and price pressures will be partially offset by expected increased operating efficiency as a result of anticipated increases in revenue 
as a result  we expect gross margins to remain the same or decline slightly in compared to we expect operating expenses in to be consistent with operating expenses 
we anticipate increased research and development expenses in compared to  primarily as a result of the continued development of our igo green technology  including expenses relating to the collaborative 
table of contents development of an integrated circuit with texas instruments based on our igo green technology 
as a result of our planned product development efforts  we expect to further expand our intellectual property position by filing for additional patents in various countries around the world 
a portion of these costs are recorded as research and development expense as incurred  and a portion are capitalized and amortized as general and administrative expense 
we may also incur additional legal and related expenses associated with the defense and enforcement of our intellectual property portfolio  which could increase our general and administrative expenses 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash flow 
our available cash and cash equivalents are held in bank deposits and money market funds in the united states and in the united kingdom 
our intent is that the cash balances in the united kingdom will remain there for future growth and investments  and we will meet any liquidity requirements in the united states through ongoing cash flows  cash on hand  external financing  or both 
we actively monitor the third party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents 
our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal while secondarily maximizing yield on those funds 
we diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities 
to date  we have experienced no material loss or lack of access to our invested cash or cash equivalents  however  we can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 
at any point in time we have funds in our operating accounts that are with third party financial institutions 
these balances in the us may exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic insurance limits 
while we monitor the cash balances in our operating accounts and adjust the cash balances as appropriate  these cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or could be subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets 
our primary use of cash has been to fund operating losses  fund acquisitions  and fund working capital needs of our business  which we expect to continue in some of our new suppliers of batteries  protection and audio products have been unwilling to extend trade credit to us on the same terms and conditions as our power product suppliers have historically done 
as a result  we are required to pay for purchases of inventory of these products in advance of the related sale of these products  which has increased our use of cash to support the working capital required to effectively operate our business 
historically  our primary sources of liquidity have been funds provided by the sale of intellectual property assets 
we cannot assure you that this source will be available to us in the future 
we currently do not maintain a credit facility with a bank  however  we may attempt to access this source of financing at some point in the future 
the following table sets forth for the period presented certain consolidated cash flow information in thousands year ended december  as recast net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities foreign currency exchange impact on cash flow increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year cash and cash equivalents at end of year 
table of contents net cash provided by used in operating activities 
cash was used in operating activities for the year ended december  to fund the working capital needs of our business  including inventory purchases 
we expect to continue to use cash in operating activities in to support the anticipated growth in our business 
our consolidated cash flow operating metrics are as follows year ended december  as recast days outstanding in ending accounts receivable dsos inventory turns the decrease in dsos at december  compared to december  was primarily due to decrease in sales to radioshack  which generally requires longer payment terms 
we expect dsos will increase in as our revenue base increases as a result of our planned expansion of direct sales to retailers and the associated anticipated timing of cash receipts from our customers 
the decrease in inventory turns was primarily due to the decline in revenue from sales to radioshack  for whom we hold no inventory 
we expect to manage inventory growth during and we expect inventory turns for to remain consistent with inventory turns 
the increase in dsos at december  compared to december  was primarily due to decreases in accounts receivable from targus  which were collected in full in mid the decrease in inventory turns was primarily due to the decline in revenue from sales to targus and radioshack  for whom we hold no inventory 
net cash provided by used in investing activities 
for the year ended december   net cash was generated by investing activities primarily as a result of the sale of short term investments net of purchases  partially offset by our investments in pure energy visions 
for the year ended december   net cash was used in investing activities as we used million in cash to acquire adapt and aerial  in addition to net purchases of million in short term investments and  in purchases of property plant and equipment 
we may use cash to fund additional acquisitions in addition to anticipated future investments in capital equipment 
net cash from financing activities 
we had no financing activities in  or although we expect to generate cash flows from operations sufficient to support our operations  we may issue additional shares of stock in the future to generate cash for growth opportunities 
furthermore  in the future  we may use cash to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock 
investments 
at december   our investments in marketable securities included one issuance of corporate common stock  one corporate debenture  seven commercial paper instruments issued by various companies  and one municipal mutual fund with an aggregate fair value of approximately million 
in june  we made an investment in pure energy  in which we received  shares of pure energy visions common stock at a price per share equal to  and an interest free convertible secured debenture having a one year repayment term that converts into an additional  shares of pure energy visions common stock in lieu of repayment either upon the achievement of certain business goals or earlier at our discretion 
we believe we have the ability to hold all marketable debt securities to maturity 
however  we may dispose of debt securities prior to their scheduled maturity due to changes in interest rates  prepayments  tax and credit considerations  liquidity or regulatory capital requirements  or other similar factors 
as a result  we classify all marketable securities as available for sale 
these securities are reported at fair value based on third party broker statements  which represents level in the fair value hierarchy 
our investment in pure energy is reported at fair value based on a quoted market price  which represents level in the fair value hierarchy 
accordingly  unrealized gains and losses related to these investments are reported in equity as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 

table of contents contractual obligations 
in our day to day business activities  we incur certain commitments to make future payments under contracts such as operating leases and purchase orders 
maturities under these contracts are set forth in the following table as of december  dollars in thousands payment due by period more than years operating lease obligations inventory purchase obligations totals off balance sheet arrangements 
we have no off balance sheet financing arrangements 
acquisitions and dispositions 
in we acquired adapt and aerial to complement our product offerings and expand our revenue base 
our future strategy includes the possible acquisition of other businesses to continue to expand or complement our operations 
the magnitude  timing and nature of any future acquisitions will depend on a number of factors  including the availability of suitable acquisition candidates  the negotiation of acceptable terms  our financial capabilities and general economic and business conditions 
financing of future acquisitions would result in the utilization of cash  incurrence of additional debt  issuance of additional equity securities or a combination of all of these 
our future strategy may also include the possible disposition of assets that are not considered integral to our business which would likely result in the generation of cash 
net operating loss carryforwards 
as of december   we had approximately million of federal net operating loss carryforwards which expire at various dates 
we anticipate that the sale of common stock in our initial public offering and in subsequent private offerings  as well as the issuance of our common stock for acquisitions  coupled with prior sales of common stock will cause an annual limitation on the use of our net operating loss carryforwards pursuant to the change in ownership provisions of section of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
this limitation is expected to have a material effect on the timing of and our ability to use the net operating loss carryforwards in the future 
additionally  our ability to use the net operating loss carry forwards is dependent upon our level of future profitability  which cannot be determined 
liquidity outlook 
based on our projections  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
if we require additional capital resources to grow our business internally or to acquire complementary technologies and businesses at any time in the future  we may seek to obtain debt financing or sell additional equity securities 
the sale of additional equity securities would result in more dilution to our stockholders 
in addition  additional capital resources may not be available to us in amounts or on terms that are acceptable to us 
recent accounting pronouncements see note s to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of recently issued accounting pronouncements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks in the ordinary course of our business 
these risks result primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
in addition  our international operations are subject to risks related to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures and other regulations and restrictions 

table of contents to date we have not utilized derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments 
we do not expect to employ these or other strategies to hedge market risk in the foreseeable future 
we invest our cash in money market funds and short term investments  which are subject to minimal credit and market risk 
we believe that the market risks associated with these financial instruments are immaterial 
see liquidity and capital resources for further discussion of our capital structure 
market risk  calculated as the potential change in fair value of our cash equivalents and short term investments resulting from a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates  was not material at december
