risk factors of this report 
executive overview after the strong recovery of  when worldwide oil demand grew million barrels per day to million barrels per day corresponding to the largest year on year increase in years  oil demand grew only by a modest million barrels per day in this resulted from the combination of economic concerns in the oecd countries and lower growth in the emerging economies 
on the supply side  the unrest in north africa and the middle east  and more specifically the shutdown of libyan production from early in the first quarter through the end of the third quarter  significantly tightened worldwide production capacity thereby limiting opec spare capacity to its lowest level since non opec production remained essentially flat year on year  as the steady increase in north american liquids production was offset by the declining output of mature basins 
tight supply maintained sufficient pressure on oil prices to offset sluggish demand growth  and yearly average prices set new records 
natural gas markets behaved differently between the three major geographic areas of consumption 
in north america  a continuous increase in unconventional gas production  modest demand growth  and mild weather at the beginning of the winter season contributed to maintain storage at or above five year highs and keep natural gas prices low 
in asia  the need for alternative energy sources following the fukushima incident  along with the fast growing demand in non oecd economies maintained gas prices high and led to a significant increase in the demand for liquified natural gas 
in europe  despite decreasing demand  prices continued to be supported by the influence of asian demand on common suppliers prices and by declining production in the north sea 
in this environment  schlumberger oilfield services revenue reached a historical high in of billion an increase of over while this reflected a full year of revenue from the acquisitions of smith international in august and geoservices in april the same year  overall business conditions worldwide also improved during the year 
in north america  which grew by compared to  this was seen through increased activity  stronger pricing and improved asset utilization as the market continued to shift to the liquids rich plays that demanded higher service intensity in drilling and completing horizontal wells 
a gradual return to activity in the deepwater us gulf of mexico  which accelerated as the year progressed also contributed to north american results 
international growth of was marked by strengthening activity in deepwater areas and active exploration basins as well as by signs of pricing traction for certain technologies 
in the latin america area  where revenue grew by  drilling and production activity increased 
europe  cis and africa grew by in revenue terms with strength in the north sea and russia but suffered the most in terms of the geopolitical unrest that affected north africa and the middle east with libya shut down from late february until operations recommenced in october 
revenue in the middle east asia area increased by driven by improving activity in iraq and saudi arabia although these improvements were slowed by geopolitical unrest 
all three product groups saw improved activity 
the most substantial gain was recorded by the drilling group due largely to the full year s revenue from the acquisitions of smith international and geoservices 
however  this was underpinned by growth across almost all drilling group technologies driven by overall activity and pricing gains during the year for drilling measurements services 
the ramp up in integrated project management ipm well construction projects in iraq also contributed to the growth 
reservoir production services and products grew by led by well services in north america through higher pricing  capacity additions and improved asset utilization and efficiency as the market transitioned to liquid rich plays 
reservoir characterization grew by  led by wireline on activity mix and westerngeco on higher multiclient seismic sales 
market penetration of new technologies in a number of areas also contributed to the year s performance 
in reservoir characterization services  the growing wave of exploration projects increased demand for the wireline scanner family measurements that provide more complete understanding of difficult and complex formations 
in many cases  complementary technologies deployed included insitu fluid analyzer and quicksilver probe formation fluid testing and sampling services while other advanced wireline technologies were used in the evaluation of unconventional reservoirs 
westerngeco benefited from this trend with new contracts for coil shooting and dual coil shooting full azimuth seismic acquisition surveys  a type of survey unique to schlumberger 

table of contents further integration of schlumberger and smith drilling focused technologies boosted drilling group results 
in particular  the growing use of smith ideas modeling software enabled optimal selection of bottomhole assembly components  particularly in matching drillbits to rotary steerable systems 
among individual product lines  smith drillbit technologies benefited from the larger schlumberger geographical footprint  while drilling measurements scope family logging while drilling services played significant roles in enhancing performance in a number of complex  high profile wells 
in particular  china and russia saw increasing penetration of schlumberger drilling group technologies 
demand for reservoir production technologies was boosted by growing deployment of the hiway channel fracturing service in unconventional and tight reservoir applications around the world 
by midyear  hiway technology had been introduced across all four geographical areas  with more than  stages pumped 
the hiway service is part of the schlumberger approach that achieves more performance with less equipment and resources and this number of stages alone saved over  tons of proppant compared to conventional operations 
in the fourth quarter  stages pumped grew by sequentially and operations were conducted for customers 
a number of small technology based acquisitions were completed during in addition to completion of the eurasia drilling company ltd asset swap and strategic alliance announced in these included the purchase of the remaining equity interest in framo engineering as  a privately owned norwegian company specializing in the sales and manufacture of products and services related to multiphase pumps and subsea pump systems  multiphase metering systems and swivel and marine systems 
schlumberger also completed the purchase of thrubit llc  a company providing openhole logging services using a unique through the bit deployment technique that offers a novel way of obtaining wireline logs in horizontal wells in shale plays 
in ipm  schlumberger and saxon energy services merged their respective land based rig fleets resulting in schlumberger rigs and crews operating in oman  pakistan and venezuela becoming part of saxon s operations 
under the terms of the agreement  saxon will also provide technical drilling contracting support to existing schlumberger joint ventures in saudi arabia  algeria  iraq and venezuela  ensuring availability and support to schlumberger well construction activities 
as part of a stronger focus on the growing production services enhancement market  schlumberger production management was formed during the year to increase market participation and became responsible for the casabe and bokor projects that were previously managed by ipm 
for  projected gross domestic product gdp growth continued to be revised downwards during the fourth quarter  and positive signs from the us and japan are offset by continued concerns over the eurozone and the potential slowing of growth in china 
in spite of the political efforts to resolve the issues  the uncertainty surrounding the global financial markets is expected to continue in the coming quarters  and although the chance of a global double dip recession remains a possibility  this is not expected to be the most likely scenario 
in line with lower gdp growth  oil demand outlook has also been revised downwards during the fourth quarter although the increasing weight of the emerging economies  the weakness of non opec supply  and a number of geopolitical concerns have supported oil prices 
absent a global recession  these are not expected to weaken significantly 
for natural gas worldwide  little change is expected in the behavior of the main geographical markets in compared to feedback from schlumberger customers and the findings from recently published spending surveys suggest that exploration and production investment in will be higher than that of  although the predicted levels vary 
the same surveys suggest that exploration spending will continue to increase 
against this backdrop schlumberger is planning for growth in  although with significant flexibility 
in north america  land rig count is expected to remain flat with fourth quarter levels  provided the ongoing drop in gas rig activity will be countered by increasing activity in liquids and liquids rich basins 
a continued recovery in the deepwater gulf of mexico is also expected  with strong demand for high value technologies 
in international markets  rig count in is expected to increase by around versus  driven by strong offshore activity in west africa  north sea and brazil  and by land activity in the middle east  north africa and western siberia 
overall schlumberger remains confident that any potential reductions in activity will be short lived due to limited spare oil capacity and to growing international demand for natural gas 
further  the company believes its competitive position remains strong given its strength in the international market in terms of global footprint and contract portfolio  and given the balance that has been established between reservoir characterization  drilling and production services in north america

westerngeco also improved with the resumption of land seismic activity in the middle east and new surveys in north africa 
wireline reported considerable growth across all geographical areas  and particularly on stronger offshore exploration activities in the nigeria gulf of guinea  southern eastern africa and central west africa geomarkets 
drilling revenue increased on higher m i swaco activity in north america land  the us gulf of mexico and latin america 
ipm revenue increased significantly  mostly from projects in mexico and iraq  while drilling measurements revenue was higher on improved pricing and strong activity in the us gulf of mexico and the nigeria gulf of guinea geomarket 
reservoir production revenue increased  driven by stronger completions and artificial lift product sales across all areas 
in north america land  well services grew through capacity additions and continued improvements in asset utilization and crew efficiency 
in addition  framo and schlumberger production management spm posted strong sequential increases 
on a geographical basis  north america area revenue grew sequentially on increasing deepwater work in the us gulf of mexico  higher rig count and land activity in the us and canada  and significant westerngeco multiclient sales 
in addition  well services reported considerable increases from additional fleet deployment and continued improvements in asset utilization and crew efficiency 
in the latin america area  strong revenue was recorded in the mexico central america geomarket from higher ipm project activities and sis software sales  in the venezuela  trinidad tobago geomarket from westerngeco marine seismic activities  and in the peru  colombia ecuador geomarket from robust artificial lift product sales 
in the europe cis africa area  strong results were led by the angola geomarket  which saw vigorous westerngeco multiclient sales in addition to expanded presalt offshore activity for wireline  testing services drilling measurements  the nigeria gulf of guinea geomarket  which recorded robust completions product sales and higher drilling measurements and wireline activity  and the north africa geomarket that reported higher wireline  testing services  well services and ipm project activity 
these increases  however  were reduced by lower north sea activity which was impacted by seasonal weather issues 
in the middle east asia area  strong completions and artificial lift product sales and robust sis software sales drove results particularly in the india geomarket 
these results were augmented by continued growth in the saudi arabia  bahrain geomarket due to the rebound of land seismic acquisition  strong rigless activity and land rig additions 
the oman geomarket grew primarily on higher wireline and artificial lift activities while the iraq geomarket saw an increase in non project services in addition to new ipm projects 
pretax operating income of billion increased sequentially over prior quarter 
pretax operating margin increased basis points bps sequentially to primarily due to the strong sales of westerngeco multiclient licenses  sis software and completions products 
drilling measurements and wireline also contributed to this sequential improvement through increasing higher margin exploration activities 
reservoir characterization fourth quarter revenue of billion was higher sequentially 
pretax operating income of million was higher compared to the third quarter of westerngeco and sis posted significant sequential revenue growth on strong multiclient sales in the us gulf of mexico and the angola geomarket  and on robust software sales across all geographical areas  respectively 
westerngeco also improved on the resumption of land seismic activity in the middle east and new surveys in north africa 
wireline recorded increases across all areas led by stronger offshore exploration activities in the nigeria gulf of guinea  southern eastern africa and central west africa geomarkets 
data consulting services and testing services also posted gains 
sequentially  pretax operating margins increased markedly by bps to through the seasonally strong sales of westerngeco multiclient licenses and sis software 
increasing higher margin wireline exploration activities also contributed to the growth 

table of contents drilling fourth quarter revenue of billion was higher sequentially 
pretax operating income of million improved sequentially 
significant sequential revenue growth was recorded by m i swaco from higher rig count on land in the us canada  sustained growth in deepwater activity in the us gulf of mexico  and strong contributions in latin america 
ipm activity increased significantly  mainly from projects in mexico and in iraq 
drilling measurements revenue increased on improved pricing and strong activity in the us gulf of mexico and the nigeria gulf of guinea geomarket  although this was partially offset by weather related activity reductions in the north sea and east asia geomarkets 
in addition  geoservices and bits advanced technologies registered robust sequential increases 
sequentially  pretax operating margins were up slightly to 
drilling measurements obtained increased margins from improved technology mix and service pricing but this was partly offset by the effects of weather related activity delays and reductions 
most of the other technologies exacted margin expansion following the continued successful integration and expansion of smith  geoservices and schlumberger drilling technologies 
reservoir production fourth quarter revenue of billion increased over the prior quarter 
pretax operating income of million was higher sequentially 
among reservoir production group technologies  completions and artificial lift posted the strongest sequential growth driven by robust product sales across all areas 
well services sequential growth was seen mainly in north america land as additional fleets deployed and continued improvements in asset utilization and crew efficiency were achieved although these positive factors were partially muted by the impact of year end seasonal effects 
framo and spm also posted strong sequential increases 
sequentially  fourth quarter pretax operating margins were slightly up at 
completions  artificial lift and well services reported improvements from strong sales

charges and credits are described in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
oilfield services full year revenue of billion was higher than primarily reflecting the acquisition of smith on august  as well as the significantly improved activity  pricing and asset efficiency for well services technologies in north america as the market transitioned to liquid rich plays demanding increasing service intensity in drilling and completing horizontal wells 
year on year pretax operating margin increased bps to largely due to the improved pricing and asset efficiency for well services technologies in north america and the resumption of higher margin activity in the us gulf of mexico 
however  the margin expansion was tempered by activity disruptions from the geopolitical unrest in north africa and in the middle east during the first quarter of reservoir characterization revenue of billion was higher than the same period last year on stronger wireline activity  higher westerngeco marine and multiclient sales  and increased sis software sales 
year on year  pretax operating margin decreased bps to led by margin declines in wireline and testing services  largely due to the revenue mix  as well as the impact of geopolitical events which prevailed during the first quarter of the margin decline however was partially offset by a favorable westerngeco multiclient sales mix and improved marine vessel utilization 
drilling revenue of billion was higher than the same period last year reflecting the acquisitions of smith  in august  and geoservices  in april  partially offset by a decrease in ipm activities in mexico 
the ramp up of ipm projects in iraq also contributed to the revenue increase 
year on year  pretax operating margin decreased bps to largely due to the addition of the smith and geoservices activities as well as the effects of the geopolitical events 

table of contents reservoir production revenue of billion was higher than the same period last year while pretax operating margin increased bps to 
well services revenue and margins expanded strongly in north america on higher pricing  capacity additions and improved asset utilization and efficiency as the market transitioned to liquid rich plays 
internationally  well services also posted growth on the strength of higher activity  despite the exceptional geopolitical events which prevailed during the first quarter of distribution revenue of billion increased billion  while pretax operating income of million increased million compared to last year 
these increases are attributable to the fact that reflected only four months of activity following the smith acquisition

table of contents oilfield services full year revenue of billion was higher than this increase was largely attributable to the acquisition of smith as well as significantly higher activity and pricing for well services technologies in us land 
however  these increases were partially offset by lower activity in the us gulf of mexico due to the deepwater drilling moratorium and by lower pricing and activity in europe cis africa 
year on year  pretax operating margin declined bps to primarily due to the inclusion of the acquired smith businesses as well as the reduced activity and weaker pricing in the europe cis africa area 
these effects  however  were partially offset by the impact of the stronger activity and pricing for well services technologies in us land 
reservoir characterization revenue of billion was lower than last year 
westerngeco revenue decreased primarily due to reduced activity and pricing for marine acquisition services  which was partially offset by higher sales of wide azimuth multiclient surveys in the us gulf of mexico 
wireline revenue fell primarily due to the deepwater drilling moratorium in the gulf of mexico and reduced activity and lower pricing in europe cis africa 
testing services revenue also decreased as a result of lower activity and pricing in europe cis africa 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in sis revenue primarily in latin america and north america 
year on year  pretax operating margin decreased bps to mostly due to the lower activity and pricing for wireline and testing services in europe cis africa and from the impact of the moratorium in the us gulf of mexico 
drilling revenue of billion was higher than the previous year 
this increase was primarily driven from the acquisitions of smith and geoservices during partially offset by lower revenue for drilling measurements due to the impact of the deepwater drilling moratorium in the us gulf of mexico and generally lower pricing in international markets 
year on year  pretax operating margin decreased bps to due to the inclusion of the smith and geoservices technologies as well the lower pricing and activity for drilling measurements 
reservoir production revenue of billion was higher year on year mostly from significantly higher pricing and activity for well services technologies in north america and increased gain share from spm field production projects in latin america 
in addition  an million early payout relating to services on an spm gain share project  triggered by the customer s sale of the field  also contributed to the revenue growth 
year on year  pretax operating margin increased bps to primarily due to improved pricing and activity for well services in north america and strong contribution from the spm field production projects 
the spm gain share early payout mentioned above contributed approximately million to pretax operating income 
interest and other income interest and other income consisted of the following stated in millions interest income equity in net earnings of affiliated companies m i swaco others other 
table of contents equity in net earnings of affiliated companies equity income from the m i swaco joint venture in represents eight months of equity income through the closing of the smith transaction 
interest expense interest expense of million in increased by million compared to primarily due to the billion of long term debt that schlumberger issued during interest expense of million in decreased by million compared to primarily due to a decline in the weighted average borrowing rates  from to 
other research engineering and general administrative expenses  as a percentage of revenue  were as follows research engineering general administrative although research engineering decreased as a percentage of revenue in as compared to and in compared to  it has increased in absolute dollars by million and million  respectively 
these increases in absolute dollars were driven in large part by the impact of the smith acquisition 
income taxes the schlumberger effective tax rate was in  in  and in the schlumberger effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings 
when the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of north america increases  the schlumberger effective tax rate will generally decrease 
conversely  when the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of north america decreases  the schlumberger effective tax rate will generally increase 
the effective tax rate for both and was impacted by the charges and credits described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
excluding the impact of these charges and credits  the effective tax rate in was compared to in this increase in the effective tax rate  excluding the impact of the charges and credits  was primarily attributable to the fact that schlumberger generated a larger proportion of its pretax earnings in north america in as compared to as a result of improved market conditions and the effect of a full year s activity from the acquired smith businesses 
the effective tax rate for was also impacted by the charges and credits described in note to the consolidated financial statements  but to a much lesser extent 
excluding charges and credits  the effective tax rate in was compared to in this increase is largely attributable to the geographic mix of earnings as well as the inclusion of four months results from the acquisition of smith  which served to increase the schlumberger effective tax rate

although these contractual obligations are considered enforceable and legally binding  the terms generally allow schlumberger the option to reschedule and adjust its requirements based on business needs prior to the delivery of goods 
refer to note pension and other benefit plans of the consolidated financial statements for details regarding schlumberger s pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 
as discussed in note income taxes of the consolidated financial statements  included in the schlumberger consolidated balance sheet at december  is approximately billion of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions in the over jurisdictions in which schlumberger conducts business 
due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations  combined with the difficulty in predicting when tax audits throughout the world may be concluded  schlumberger cannot make reliable estimates of the timing of cash outflows relating to these liabilities 
schlumberger has outstanding letters of credit guarantees which relate to business performance bonds  custom excise tax commitments  facility lease rental obligations  etc 
these were entered into in the ordinary course of business and are customary practices in the various countries where schlumberger operates 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires schlumberger to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by schlumberger about matters that are inherently uncertain 
a summary of all of schlumberger s significant accounting policies is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
schlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
multiclient seismic data the westerngeco business capitalizes the costs associated with obtaining multiclient seismic data 
the carrying value of the multiclient seismic data library at december  and was million and million  respectively 
such costs are charged to cost of revenue based on the percentage of the total costs to the estimated total revenue that schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data 
however  under no circumstances will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a year  straight line amortized value 
the carrying value of surveys is reviewed for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred 
adjustments to the carrying value are recorded when it is determined that estimated future revenues  which involve significant judgment on the part of schlumberger  would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the surveys 
significant adverse changes in schlumberger s estimated future cash flows could result in impairment charges in a future period 
for purposes of performing the annual impairment test of the multiclient library  future cash flows are analyzed primarily based on two pools of surveys united states and non united states 
the united states and non united states pools were determined to be the most appropriate level at which to perform the impairment review based upon a number of factors including i various macroeconomic factors that influence the ability to successfully market surveys and ii the focus of the sales force and related costs 
certain larger surveys  which are typically prefunded by customers  are analyzed for impairment on a survey by survey basis 
allowance for doubtful accounts schlumberger maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to record accounts receivable at their net realizable value 
judgment is involved in recording and making adjustments to this reserve 
allowances have been recorded for receivables believed to be uncollectible  including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such as disputed invoices 
depending on how such potential issues are resolved  or if the financial condition of schlumberger customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  adjustments to the allowance may be required 
goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets schlumberger records the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired as goodwill 
the goodwill relating to each of schlumberger s reporting units is tested for impairment annually as well as when an event  or change in circumstances  indicates an impairment may have occurred 
under generally accepted accounting principles  schlumberger has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of one of its reporting units is greater than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  schlumberger determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  then there is no need to perform any further testing 
however  if schlumberger concludes otherwise  then it is required to perform the first step of a two step impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 

table of contents schlumberger has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the first step of the two step goodwill impairment test 
for purposes of performing the impairment test for goodwill  schlumberger s four reporting units are the three groups comprising oilfield services reservoir characterization  drilling and reservoir production  as well as the distribution business segment 
schlumberger elected to perform the qualitative assessment described above for purposes of its annual goodwill impairment test 
based on this assessment  schlumberger concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of its reporting units was greater than its carrying amount 
accordingly  no further testing was required 
long lived assets  including fixed assets and intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in reviewing for impairment  the carrying value of such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
if such cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset s recorded value  an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the long lived asset to its estimated fair value 
the determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of long lived assets involves significant estimates on the part of management 
if there is a material change in economic conditions or other circumstances influencing the estimate of future cash flows or fair value  schlumberger could be required to recognize impairment charges in the future 
schlumberger evaluates the remaining useful life of its intangible assets on a periodic basis to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining estimated amortization period 
income taxes schlumberger conducts business in more than tax jurisdictions  a number of which have tax laws that are not fully defined and are evolving 
schlumberger s tax filings are subject to regular audits by the tax authorities 
these audits may result in assessments for additional taxes which are resolved with the authorities or  potentially  through the courts 
tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes which will be due upon the conclusion of these audits 
estimates of these tax liabilities are made based upon prior experience and are updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances 
however  due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations  it is possible that the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities which could be materially different from these estimates 
in such an event  schlumberger will record additional tax expense or tax benefit in the period in which such resolution occurs 
pension and postretirement benefits schlumberger s pension and postretirement benefit obligations are described in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts  which include critical assumptions related to the discount rate  expected rate of return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates 
these assumptions are important elements of expense and or liability measurement and are updated on an annual basis  or upon the occurrence of significant events 
the discount rate schlumberger uses reflects the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high quality debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of the payment of the benefit obligations 
the following summarizes the discount rates utilized by schlumberger for its various pension and postretirement benefit plans the discount rate utilized to determine the liability for schlumberger s united states pension plans and postretirement medical plans was at december  and at december  the weighted average discount rate utilized to determine the liability for schlumberger s international pension plans was at december  and at december  the weighted average discount rate utilized to determine expense for schlumberger s united states pension plans and postretirement medical plans decreased from in to in the weighted average discount rate utilized to determine expense for schlumberger s international pension plans decreased from in to in 
table of contents a higher discount rate decreases the present value of benefit obligations and decreases expense 
the expected rate of return for our retirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return expected to be earned on plan assets over the period that benefits included in the benefit obligation are expected to be paid 
the expected rate of return for schlumberger s united states pension plans has been determined based upon expectations regarding future rates of return for the investment portfolio  with consideration given to the distribution of investments by asset class and historical rates of return for each individual asset class 
the expected rate of return on plan assets for the united states pension plans was in and in the weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets for the international plans was in and in a lower expected rate of return would increase pension expense 
schlumberger s medical cost trend rate assumptions are developed based on historical cost data  the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends 
the overall medical cost trend rate assumption utilized to determine both the postretirement medical expense as well as the postretirement medical liability as of december  was graded to over the next six years
