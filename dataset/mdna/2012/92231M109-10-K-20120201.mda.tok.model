we intend to capitalize on this market opportunity through the continued introduction of new products and services 
we expect to originate these new products and services primarily through our internal research and development and clinical efforts  but we may supplement them with targeted acquisitions or other external collaborations 
additionally  our growth has been  and will continue to be  impacted by our expansion and penetration into new geographic markets  the expansion and penetration of our direct sales organization in existing geographic markets  and our continuing focus to increase the efficiency of our existing direct sales organization

amortization of the king deferred revenue will be  per year for the remainder of the year license period  reflecting the remaining amortization allocated to the topical indication of the thrombi gel and thrombi pad products 
gross margin across all product lines remained constant at for the years ended december   december  and december  we expect product gross margins to be in the range of to in  subject to variations in our selling mix between us and international markets and between our lower margin products such as the vari lase products and our higher margin products such as the d stat dry 
collaboration expense was for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  collaboration expense was primarily the result of our collaboration revenue related to the clinical and development work being performed for king 
we do not expect to incur any additional collaboration expense during research and development expense for the year ended december  totaled  or of revenue  compared to  or of revenue for the year ended december  and  or of revenue for the year ended december  the increase in research and development expense on a dollar basis resulted from additional documentation and testing requirements imposed by the fda on several of our new product submissions 
we expect our continuing research and development expense to be approximately to of revenue in as we continue to pursue additional new products and move our longer term development projects forward 
clinical and regulatory expense for the year ended december  totaled  or of revenue  compared to  or of revenue for the year ended december  and  or of revenue for the year ended december  clinical and regulatory expense has increased as we hired additional employees to strengthen our expertise in the regulatory and quality areas in response to the changes in the fda requirements in and we expect clinical and regulatory expense to be approximately of revenue in sales and marketing expense for the year ended december  totaled  or of revenue  compared to  or of revenue for the year ended december  and  or of revenue for the year ended december  the decline in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue primarily resulted from maintaining our us direct sales force at between and full time employees while continuing to grow revenue 
we expect to maintain the same relative size of our direct sales force during as a result  we expect our sales and marketing expense will continue to decline as a percentage of revenue to between and of revenue by the end of general and administrative expense for the year ended december  totaled  or of revenue  compared to  or of revenue for the year ended december  and  or of revenue for the year ended december  general and administrative expense has decreased on a dollar and percentage basis compared to the year ended december  in accordance with accounting rules accounting standards codification asc  business combinations  we reduced the radius earn out liability in the amount of  on september   which reduced general and administrative expenses by a corresponding amount 
the radius earn out liability was created as part of the radius acquisition and  post adjustment  is  see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this annual report on form k for the year ended december  
we will continue to assess the radius earn out liability balance and make any necessary adjustments in future periods  if warranted 
we expect general and administrative expense to be approximately of revenue during litigation expense was for the year ended december   compared to litigation income of  for the year ended december   and litigation expense of for the year ended december  the litigation income resulted from an award of damages the company received in the first quarter of in the marine polymer technologies  inc litigation see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report on k for the year ended december  
amortization of purchased technology and other intangibles was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the amortization resulted from our purchase of the smartneedle and pdaccess products in april  the radius snare products in october and the guardian hemostasis valve products in january as part of these asset purchases  we allocated  to purchased technology and other intangibles that are being amortized over a period of to years see notes and to the consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report on k for the year ended december  
we recorded income tax expense of  for the year ended december   compared to an income tax benefit of  for the year ended december  and income tax expense of  for the year ended december  we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income during the fourth quarter of each year 
we consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance necessary to offset our deferred tax assets that will not be recoverable 
in the fourth quarter of  based upon management s assessment of all available evidence  including our cumulative pretax net income for fiscal years  and  estimates of future profitability and the overall prospects of our business  we determined that it was more likely than not that we would utilize substantially all of our deferred tax assets in the future  and as a result we recorded a million income tax benefit at december  we will continue to assess the potential realization of our deferred tax assets on an annual basis or on an interim basis if circumstances warrant 
if our actual results and updated projections vary significantly from our prior estimates  we expect to increase or decrease our valuation allowance against our gross deferred tax assets 
any adjustment to our earnings for the deferred tax would occur in the period we make the determination 
prior to  we did not generate any significant pre tax income in any year and therefore have not paid any federal income taxes  other than alternative minimum taxes  since our inception in december as of december   we had approximately million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income which begin to expire in the year included in this amount are approximately million of deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options 
when these stock option exercise deductions are realized for financial statement purposes they will not result in a reduction in income tax expense  rather the benefit will be recorded as additional paid in capital 
as of december   we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million which begin to expire in the year we have recorded an allowance of approximately  relating to those research and development tax credit carryforwards expected to expire prior to being utilized 
as of december   we also had a foreign tax loss carryforward of approximately  which does not expire 
under the united states tax reform act of  the amounts of and benefits from net operating loss carryforwards may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances  including significant changes in ownership interests 
future use of our existing net operating loss carryforwards may be restricted due to changes in ownership or from future tax legislation 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents totaled  at december  compared to  in cash and cash equivalents at december   a decrease of  our cash equivalents are invested in a money market fund invested in all types of high quality  short term money market instruments denominated in us dollars such as debt instruments guaranteed by the governments of the united states  western europe  australia  japan and canada  high quality corporate issuers and bank obligations 
the money market fund s assets are rated in the highest short term category by nationally recognized rating agencies  such as moody s or standard poor s 
cash provided by operations 
we generated  of cash from operations during the year ended december  primarily resulting from our earnings before taxes of  since essentially all of our income taxes are offset by the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 
in the year ended december  we increased our accounts receivable by  and our inventory by  which was in line with our revenue growth projections and expectations 
in addition  we incurred  of non cash depreciation  amortization and stock compensation   of non cash charges relating to the amortization of deferred license fees and other deferred revenue  and  of non cash charges relating to the adjustment of the earn out as part of the radius acquisition for the year ended december  cash used for investing activities 
we used  of cash in investing activities during the year ended december  we used  of cash in the purchase of the guardian hemostasis valve assets from zerusa   of cash to make the final payment for the snare and retrieval products we acquired from radius  and  of cash to purchase the rights to sell reprocessing services from nes 
we also incurred capital expenditures of  relating to our purchase of additional manufacturing equipment  expanding our manufacturing clean room space  expanding our extrusion capabilities and purchasing additional research and development equipment 
cash used for financing activities 
we used  of cash in financing activities during the year ended december  we used  to repurchase common shares under our stock repurchase plan  and we used  of cash to repurchase shares that vested under outstanding restricted stock awards to satisfy income tax withholding obligations 
this amount was offset by our receipt of  of cash under our employee stock purchase plan and upon the exercise of outstanding stock options 
we have a million revolving line of credit with us bank  which expires on december   bears interest at the rate of libor plus and is secured by a first security interest on all of our assets 
the credit facility includes one covenant that we cannot have a maximum cash flow leverage ratio greater than to the calculation of this covenant is determined by multiplying our annual lease expenses times six and adding any loans  then dividing this amount by the sum of our earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and our annual operating lease payments 
we were in compliance with this covenant on december  as of december   we had no outstanding balance on the million revolving line of credit with an availability of million 
the following table summarizes our contractual cash commitments as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years facility operating leases not included in the table above are the expected payments for contingent consideration related to our acquisition of radius 
the contingent consideration payments are based on of the net sales of the snare and retrieval products which exceed million and million for the calendar years ending december  and  respectively 
this amount was not included in the table above due to our inability to predict the amount and timing of the cash portion of the payments see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report on k for the year ended december  
we do not have any other significant cash commitments related to supply agreements  nor do we have any significant commitments for capital expenditures 
on january   we purchased the rights  patents and intellectual property relating to the pronto extraction catheter from dr 
silva and his affiliates in exchange for million  and as a result will not pay any future royalty on sales of pronto catheters after december  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report on k for the year ended december  
off balance sheet arrangements 
we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined by the rules and regulations of the sec  that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
as a result  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these arrangements 
we currently anticipate that we will experience positive cash flow from our normal operating activities for the foreseeable future 
we currently believe that our working capital of million at december  will be sufficient to meet all of our operating and capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  our actual liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous unpredictable factors  including the amount of revenues from sales of our existing and new products  the cost of maintaining  enforcing and defending patents and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  developments related to regulatory and third party reimbursement matters  and other factors 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations addresses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate these estimates and judgments 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report on k for the year ended december  we set forth below those material accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to an investor s understanding of our financial results and condition and that require complex management judgment 
inventory we state our inventory at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
the estimated value of excess  obsolete and slow moving inventory as well as inventory with a carrying value in excess of its net realizable value is established by us on a quarterly basis through review of inventory on hand and assessment of future demand  anticipated release of new products into the market  historical experience and product expiration 
our stated value of inventory could be materially different if demand for our products decreased because of competitive conditions or market acceptance  or if products become obsolete because of advancements in the industry 
we have approximately  of sigma thrombin in inventory at december   which we expect to use in our hemostat products sold in international markets 
we received regulatory approval in february allowing us to use the sigma thrombin in our international hemostat products 
in the fourth quarter of  we wrote off  of our sigma thrombin which we expect will expire before we are able to use it 
we will continue to review our sigma thrombin needs and we will write off any amounts we anticipate will not be used 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as outlined in asc s  revenue recognition  which requires that four basic criteria be met before revenue can be recognized i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii the price is fixed or determinable  iii collectability is reasonably assured  and iv product delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 
we recognize revenue as products are shipped based on fob shipping point terms when title passes to customers 
we negotiate credit terms on a customer by customer basis and products are shipped at an agreed upon price 
all product returns must be pre approved and  if approved  customers are subject to a restocking charge 
we generate revenue from license agreements and research collaborations and recognize these revenues when earned 
in accordance with asc  for deliverables which contain multiple deliverables  we separate the deliverables into separate accounting units if they meet the following criteria i the delivered items have a stand alone value to the customer  ii the fair value of any undelivered items can be reliably determined  and iii if the arrangement includes a general right of return  delivery of the undelivered items is probable and substantially controlled by the seller 
deliverables that do not meet these criteria are combined with one or more other deliverables into one accounting unit 
revenue from each accounting unit is recognized based on the applicable accounting literature  primarily asc s we also will generate revenue in from the closurefast catheter reprocessing service rights acquired from nes in december in accordance with asc the reprocessing revenue will be reported as our revenue and the amount paid to nes will be reported as our cost of sales see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this annual report on form k for the year ended december  
effective april  we entered into a five year distribution agreement with nicolai  gmbh 
as a result of entering into this distribution agreement  we no longer maintain a direct sales force in germany 
in connection with this distribution agreement  we received  euros from nicolai  gmbh in the payment was deferred and is being recognized ratably over the five year term of the distribution agreement 
the distribution agreement also includes provisions requiring us to pay nicolai  gmbh specific amounts if we terminate the distribution agreement prior to the end of the five year term 
we do not intend to terminate the distribution agreement and  as such  have not recorded a liability relating to these potential future payments to nicolai  gmbh 
on january   we entered into three separate agreements with king  consisting of a license agreement  a device supply agreement and a thrombin jmi supply agreement 
we licensed the exclusive rights to our products thrombi pad  thrombi gel and thrombi paste to king for a one time payment of million 
we continue to manufacture the licensed products for sale to king under the device supply agreement 
the device supply agreement requires king to pay us a million milestone payment upon the first commercial sale of thrombi gel and again upon the first commercial sale of thrombi paste 
on may  we received the first million payment related to king s first commercial sale of thrombi pad 
in king decided to suspend indefinitely the clinical development of the thrombi paste product 
in king suspended all further work on the pursuit of the surgical indication of thrombi gel 
we continue to manufacture and sell the thrombi gel and thrombi pad products to king 
we are amortizing the million license fee received on january  and the million milestone payment received on may  on a straight line basis over the remaining years 
on july   king notified us that it was terminating the development of the thrombi paste products and terminating efforts to obtain the surgical indication for the thrombi gel products 
as a result of king making this decision not to proceed  we recognized revenue of  in the third quarter of which represented the remaining deferred license revenue originally allocated to the thrombi paste products and the surgical indication of the thrombi gel products as part of the king agreements 
we will not receive the second million milestone payment 
as part of the device supply agreement  we agreed to complete the development and conduct clinical studies for thrombi gel and thrombi paste  with the expected costs related to these activities to be paid by king 
we have recognized collaboration revenue on this development agreement as it was earned under the agreements with king 
in addition  we have reviewed the provisions of asc  collaborative arrangements  and believe the adoption of this asc will have no impact on the amounts recorded under these agreements 
we analyze the rate of historical returns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns  which is included with the allowance for doubtful accounts on our balance sheet 
at december   this reserve was  compared to  at december  if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future returns  revenue could be overstated 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this allowance is regularly evaluated by us for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as past experience  credit quality of the customer base  age of the receivable balances  both individually and in the aggregate  and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
at december   this reserve was  compared to  at december  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
warranty costs we provide a warranty for certain products against defects in material and workmanship for periods of up to months 
we record a liability for warranty claims at the time of sale 
the amount of the liability is based on the amount we are charged by our original equipment manufacturer to cover the warranty period 
the original equipment manufacturer includes a one year warranty with each product sold to us 
we record a liability for the uncovered warranty period offered to a customer  provided the warranty period offered exceeds the initial one year warranty period covered by the original equipment manufacturer 
at december   this warranty provision was  compared to  at december  if the assumptions used in calculating the provision were to materially change  resulting in more defects than anticipated  an additional provision may be required 
income taxes the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the united states based on estimates and assumptions 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of our net deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
for the year ended december   we recorded a million valuation allowance and a million uncertain tax position reserve related to our net deferred tax assets of million as a result of our adoption of asc  income taxes 
at december   we have accrued for the payment of tax related interest and there was no tax interest or penalties recognized in the statements of operations 
in the fourth quarter of  based upon management s assessment of all available evidence  including our cumulative pretax net income for fiscal years  and  estimates of future profitability and the overall prospects of our business  we determined that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize substantially all of the remaining portion of our deferred tax assets in the future  and as a result recorded a million income tax benefit 
to determine the amount of the reduction in the valuation allowance  we used a discounted projection of revenue and income for the years ending december  through december  we continue to assess the potential realization of our deferred tax assets on an annual basis  or on an interim basis if circumstances warrant 
if our actual results and updated projections vary significantly from our projections  we would need to increase or decrease our valuation allowance against our gross deferred tax assets 
we would adjust our earnings for the deferred tax in the period we make the determination 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivables 
we maintain our accounts for cash and cash equivalents principally at one major bank and one investment firm in the united states 
we have a formal written investment policy that restricts the placement of investments to issuers evaluated as creditworthy 
we have not experienced any losses on our deposits of our cash and cash equivalents 
with respect to accounts receivable  we perform credit evaluations of our customers and do not require collateral 
there have been no material losses on accounts receivables 
in the united states we sell our products directly to hospitals and clinics 
in international markets  we sell our products to independent distributors who  in turn  sell to medical clinics 
we sell our product in these countries through independent distributors denominated in united states dollars  with the exception of sales from our subsidiary in ireland and sales to our distributor in germany  where sales are denominated in euros 
we distribute certain products on behalf of certain us and international manufacturers 
we pay for all distributed products in united states dollars 
we do not believe our operations are currently subject to significant market risks for interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices or other relevant market price risks of a material nature 
a change of in the euro exchange rate would result in an increase or decrease of approximately  in the amount of united states dollars we receive in payment on accounts receivable from our german distributor nicolai  gmbh and  on accounts receivable due our subsidiary in ireland 
under our current policies  we do not use foreign currency derivative instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate 
we currently have no indebtedness  but if we were to borrow amounts from our revolving credit line  we would be exposed to changes in interest rates 
advances under our revolving credit line bear interest at an annual rate indexed to libor 
we will thus be exposed to interest rate risk with respect to amounts outstanding under the line of credit to the extent that interest rates rise 
as we had no amounts outstanding on the line of credit at december   we have no exposure to interest rate changes on this credit facility 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
additionally  we will be exposed to declines in the interest rates paid on deposited funds 
a decline in the current market interest rates paid on deposits would result in interest income being reduced by approximately  on an annual basis
