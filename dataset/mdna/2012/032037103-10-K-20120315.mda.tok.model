item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in thousands  except per share amounts executive overview ampco pittsburgh corporation operates in two business segments the forged and cast rolls segment and the air and liquid processing segment 
the forged and cast rolls segment consists of union electric steel corporation union electric steel or ues and union electric steel uk limited ues uk 
union electric steel is one of the world s largest manufacturers of forged hardened steel rolls with principal operations in pennsylvania and indiana whereas ues uk produces cast iron and steel rolls in england 
rolls are supplied to manufacturers of steel and aluminum throughout the world 
the air and liquid processing segment includes aerofin  buffalo air handling and buffalo pumps  all divisions of air liquid systems corporation 
aerofin produces highly engineered heat exchange coils for a variety of users including electric utility  hvac  power generation  industrial process and other manufacturing industries 
buffalo air handling makes custom designed air handling systems for commercial  institutional and industrial building markets 
buffalo pumps manufactures centrifugal pumps for the defense  refrigeration and power generation industries 
the segment has operations in virginia and new york with headquarters in pennsylvania 
the segment distributes a significant portion of its products through a common independent group of sales offices located throughout the us and canada 
for the forged and cast rolls segment  was adversely affected by low production volumes  weak demand and competitive pricing resulting in lower profits when compared to the prior year 
additionally  order backlog and profit in the backlog dropped as the year progressed 
the segment operated between of normal capacity  versus in  due to lower than normal worldwide demand caused by the reduction in production levels for our customers 
for example  steel production activity hovered at of capacity in north america and of capacity in europe which  as a result of continued financial difficulties throughout the euro zone  slipped by year end 
also  although working at a higher utilization rate than domestic and european producers  demand by customers in asia  particularly in china  was soft due to excessive roll inventories on hand 
this lower global demand along with additional roll supply coming on stream in china and india created pricing competition resulting in discounting in order to obtain business and protect market share 
for  demand is expected to improve in north america and in asia as excessive roll inventories are depleted but will likely remain weak in europe 
competitive pricing pressures are likely to be ongoing 
furthermore  a continued weakening of the euro  as compared to the u 
s dollar and british pound  could result in a lower volume of exports and at reduced margins 
union electric steel mg roll co  ltd ues mg  the chinese joint venture company in which a subsidiary of union electric steel holds a interest  continued with limited production of rolls during the year 
the joint venture company principally manufactures and sells forged hardened steel backup rolls of a size and weight currently not able to be produced by ues 
utilizing ues technology  rolls placed in service with customers in china and other parts of the world have achieved quality and performance results comparable with rolls manufactured by the segment 
even though a chinese company  ues mg faces the same market conditions and financial issues being experienced by the forged and cast rolls segment 
despite current business conditions  we remain confident about the future 
as the western world steel industry slowly recovers and excess roll inventories in developing economies are depleted  roll industry production levels  including the segment s  will increase 
improved demand will also help alleviate pricing pressures 
we believe the recently completed capital investment program and ongoing research and development efforts have successfully positioned the segment to endure current global business conditions and to take full advantage of improving conditions whenever they occur 
for the air and liquid processing segment  benefited from a stronger beginning order backlog when compared to and a steady level of new orders throughout the year from most markets served 
new construction spending by the institutional markets has yet to exhibit any signs of a recovery 
opening order backlog for approximates that of the focus for these companies is to continue to search for new product lines and to strengthen sales distribution networks 
ampco pittsburgh annual report consolidated results of operations overview the corporation net sales forged and cast rolls air and liquid processing consolidated income loss from operations forged and cast rolls air and liquid processing corporate costs consolidated backlog forged and cast rolls air and liquid processing consolidated income loss from operations for the air and liquid processing segment includes a provision for asbestos related costs of  for see note to consolidated financial statements 
when compared to  consolidated net sales improved in the current year due to higher volumes for the cast roll operation and for each division of the air and liquid processing segment 
the increase in consolidated net sales when compared to is attributable to the forged and cast rolls segment 
consolidated income from operations for the current year improved from a year ago which included a pre tax charge of  for asbestos related costs 
otherwise  consolidated income from operations for would have been less than and a more detailed review by segment is included below 
the variance in corporate costs between the years is primarily attributable to stock based compensation costs 
gross margin  excluding depreciation  as a percentage of net sales was   and for  and  respectively 
the ongoing decrease is attributable to increasing raw material and utility costs and higher employee related expenses 
selling and administrative expenses totaled  of net sales   of net sales and  of net sales for  and  respectively 
the decrease in from is primarily due to lower stock based compensation costs and a decrease in commission expense attributable to the reduction in sales for the forged roll operation 
the increase in from is primarily attributable to escalating pension related expenses  stock based compensation associated with a grant of stock options  and higher commissions and freight costs attributable to higher sales 
the increase in depreciation expense over the years is attributable to the completion of the capital investment program for the forged and cast rolls group in mid accordingly  depreciation expense for includes a partial year of depreciation on such assets and a full year of depreciation in the goodwill impairment charge in represents the write off of goodwill associated with one of the divisions of the air and liquid processing segment 
we do not have any other material intangible assets 
the charge for asbestos litigation in represents an extension of the estimated costs of pending and future asbestos claims  net of additional insurance recoveries  to the end of the claims result from alleged personal injury from exposure to asbestos containing components historically used in some products manufactured decades ago by certain of our former subsidiary companies now operated as divisions within the air and liquid processing group 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
investment related income for and includes a dividend from our chinese cast roll joint venture of  and  respectively 
no dividend was declared or received in other income expense fluctuated primarily as a result of changes in foreign exchange gains and losses and charges related to operations discontinued years ago 
gains losses on foreign exchange transactions approximated  and ampco pittsburgh annual report  for  and  respectively  and charges related to operations discontinued years ago equaled   and  respectively 
our statutory income tax rate equals which compares to an effective income tax rate of  and for  and  respectively 
for  the effective income tax rate was unfavorably impacted by the revaluation of net deferred income tax assets associated with a reduction in the statutory income tax rate for the uk operation and adjustments to deferred income tax assets  partially offset by benefits associated with changes in uncertain tax positions 
for  the effective income tax rate was favorably impacted by beneficial permanent differences for our domestic operations and reversal of a valuation allowance previously provided against deferred income tax assets associated with foreign tax credit carryforwards 
tax consequences related to certain foreign sourced income and changes in state income tax rates offset the expected improvement 
for  the income tax provision includes an additional charge to recognize a reduction in the effective state income tax rate for which certain net deferred income tax assets will be realized 
equity losses in chinese joint venture represent union electric steel s share of the losses of ues mg see note to consolidated financial statements 
since production by the joint venture is in its early stages  operating results have been insignificant 
as a result of the above  we earned  or per common share for   or per common share for and  or per common share for net income for includes an after tax charge of  or per common share for estimated costs of asbestos related litigation through net of estimated insurance recoveries 
net income for includes an after tax charge of  or per common share for the write off of goodwill deemed to be impaired at one of the divisions of the air and liquid processing segment and a reduction in the effective state income tax rate for which certain net deferred income tax assets will be realized 
forged and cast rolls net sales operating income backlog while the segment was adversely affected by low production levels  weak demand and competitive pricing  net sales for the current year improved from a year ago due to an increase in the volume of shipments for our cast roll operation which benefited from increased market share 
for  net sales increased from due to a higher volume of shipments  particularly to our international customers 
for both years  the expected contribution to operating income from the additional sales was offset by an ongoing escalation in costs for direct and indirect materials  fuels and employee related costs 
additionally  with the completion of its capital investment program in mid  operating results included a partial year of depreciation on such assets in and a full year of depreciation in the decrease in backlog over the years is a reflective of weak demand resulting in shipments outpacing new orders and declining profitability in backlog 
additionally  the norm for the level of backlog was historically to months 
however  beginning in with the surge in global steel production and to ensure continuity of supply  customers placed orders for rolling mill rolls out several years 
in connection with the worldwide recession which began in the fourth quarter of and with sufficient orders placed  customers returned to more typical buying patterns 
as of december   approximately  of the backlog is expected to be released after in addition  we have commitments of roughly  from customers under long term supply arrangements which will be included in backlog upon receipt of specific purchase orders closer to the requirement dates for delivery 
air and liquid processing net sales operating income loss backlog income loss from operations for includes a charge for asbestos litigation of  relating to claims resulting from alleged personal injury from exposure to asbestos containing equipment manufactured decades ago see note to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  uninsured legal and case management and valuation costs associated with asbestos litigation approximated  and in  and  respectively 
in  due to uncertainties in the industry  including when business activity would return to historical levels  and excess capacity in the market place  we ampco pittsburgh annual report determined that the goodwill associated with one of the divisions of this segment was impaired and recorded a pre tax charge of  sales for each of the divisions in the segment began to improve in the current year but remain below amounts 
for aerofin  sales and operating income improved in the current year when compared to the prior year as a result of an increase in the level of coil shipments to the general industrial and fossil fuel utility markets 
while sales remain comparable to that of  operating income for the current year is less due to a shift in product mix with including a higher portion of the higher margin sales to the fossil fuel utility market 
with respect to buffalo pumps  sales and operating income for improved against due to a higher volume of shipments to the power generation market and us navy shipbuilders 
although sales for the current year remain below levels  operating income improved slightly due to better margins on shipments for the us navy 
in  buffalo air handling received a large order for a customer in medical research 
a portion of the order shipped in the current year benefiting operating results when compared to and backlog for aerofin improved at december  from the previous two year ends due to additional orders for replacement coils for customers in the fossil fuel utility market 
backlog for buffalo pumps is comparable to a year ago and higher than at december  due to additional orders for the us navy 
backlog for buffalo air handling includes the balance of the large order for a customer in medical research which will ship the majority of the year end backlog is currently scheduled to ship in liquidity and capital resources net cash flows provided by operating activities for equaled  compared to  and  for and  respectively 
while the charge for asbestos litigation recorded in reduced earnings  it did not impact cash flows by that amount 
instead  the asbestos liability  net of insurance recoveries  will be paid over a number of years and will generate tax benefits 
net asbestos related payments equaled   and  in  and  respectively  and are expected to approximate  in also  the goodwill impairment charge recorded in did not impact net cash flows provided by operating activities 
contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans approximated  in of which  were voluntary contributions   in of which  were voluntary contributions  and  in of which  were voluntary contributions 
while required minimum contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans are expected to approximate  in  further voluntarily contributions may be made 
additionally  the estimated minimum contribution to the us pension plan in would have been higher if voluntary contributions had not been made to the plan 
accounts receivable increased as of december  when compared to and as a result of higher sales in the fourth quarter 
net cash flows used in investing activities were   and  in  and  respectively  the majority of which represents expenditures relating to capital investment program for the forged and cast rolls group which was completed in mid in  ues uk was awarded a government grant of up to  toward the purchase and installation of certain machinery and equipment of which has been received 
as of december   anticipated future capital expenditures are expected to approximate  the majority of which will be spent in during  union electric steel made its final contribution to the chinese joint venture 
additionally  in  monies were deposited in escrow and are being held as collateral for the outstanding foreign currency sales contracts of ues uk 
a portion of these monies was returned in and in connection with diminishing exposure and no further deposits have been required to date 
net cash outflows from financing activities represent primarily the payment of dividends of per common share during each of the years 
additionally  stock options were exercised each year resulting in proceeds from the issuance of common stock and excess tax benefits 
the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents is primarily attributable to the fluctuation of the british pound against the us dollar 
as a result of the above  cash and cash equivalents decreased by in and ended the year at  of which approximately  is held by foreign operations in comparison to  and  at december  and  respectively 
funds on hand and funds generated from future operations are expected to be sufficient to finance our operational and capital expenditure requirements 
we also maintain short term lines of credit in excess of the cash needs of our businesses 
the total available at december  was approximately  including  in the uk and in belgium 
ampco pittsburgh annual report we had the following contractual obligations outstanding as of december  payments due by period total years other industrial revenue bond debt operating lease obligations capital expenditures pension and other postretirement benefit obligations purchase obligations unrecognized tax benefits total amount represents principal only 
interest is not included since it is variable  interest rates averaged less than in the current year 
the industrial revenue bonds begin to mature in  however  if the bonds are unable to be remarketed they will be refinanced under a separate facility 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
represents estimated contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans 
actual required contributions are contingent on a number of variables including future investment performance of the plans assets and may differ from these estimates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
contributions to the us defined benefit plan are based on the projected funded status of the plan including anticipated normal costs  amortization of unfunded liabilities and an expected return on plan assets 
with respect to the uk defined benefit plan  the trustees and ues uk have agreed to a recovery plan that estimates the amount of employer contributions  based on uk regulations  necessary to eliminate the funding deficit of the plan over an agreed period 
represents primarily commitments by one of our forged and cast rolls subsidiaries for the purchase of natural gas through covering approximately of anticipated needs to meet orders in backlog 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
represents uncertain tax positions 
amount included as other represents portion for which the period of cash settlement cannot be reasonably estimated 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
with respect to environmental matters  we are currently performing certain remedial actions in connection with the sale of real estate previously owned 
settlements were paid by our insurance carriers at two third party landfill sites where we were named a potentially responsible party 
in addition  as a result of a sale of a segment in  we retained the liability to remediate certain environmental contamination and have agreed to indemnify the buyer against third party claims arising from the discharge of certain contamination  the cost for which was accrued at the time of sale 
environmental exposures are difficult to assess and estimate for numerous reasons including lack of reliable data  the multiplicity of possible solutions  the years of remedial and monitoring activity required and the identification of new sites 
however  we believe the potential liability for all environmental proceedings of approximately  accrued at december  is considered adequate based on information known to date see note to consolidated financial statements 
the nature and scope of our business brings us into regular contact with a variety of persons  businesses and government agencies in the ordinary course of business 
consequently  we and certain of our subsidiaries from time to time are named in various legal actions 
generally  we do not anticipate that our financial condition or liquidity will be materially affected by the costs of known  pending or threatened litigation 
however  we  our subsidiaries and our divisions are involved in multiple claims for alleged personal injury from exposure to asbestos containing components used in certain products and there can be no assurance that future claims will not present significantly greater and longer lasting financial exposure than presently contemplated see note to consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements our off balance sheet arrangements include the operating lease and purchase obligations disclosed in the contractual obligations table and the letters of credit unrelated to the industrial revenue bonds as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
effects of inflation while inflationary and market pressures on costs are likely to be experienced  it is anticipated that ongoing improvements in manufacturing efficiencies and cost savings efforts will mitigate the effects of inflation on operating results 
the ability to pass on increases in the price of commodities to the customer is contingent upon current market conditions with us potentially having to absorb some portion of such increase 
product pricing for the forged and cast rolls segment is reflective of current costs with a majority of orders subject to a variable index surcharge program which helps to protect the segment and its customers against the volatility in the cost of certain raw materials 
additionally  long term labor agreements exist at each of the key locations and commitments have been executed for natural gas usage to cover a portion of orders in the backlog 
ampco pittsburgh annual report application of critical accounting policies we have identified critical accounting policies that are important to the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations and involve the most complex or subjective assessments 
critical accounting policies relate to accounting for pension and other postretirement benefits  assessing recoverability of long lived assets  litigation  environmental matters  income taxes and stock based compensation 
accounting for pension and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works 
to accomplish this  input from our actuary is evaluated and extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation  long term rate of return on plan assets  mortality  rates of increases in compensation  employee turnover and discount rates 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is an estimate of average rates of earnings expected to be earned on funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation 
since these benefits will be paid over many years  the expected long term rate of return is reflective of current investment returns and investment returns over a longer period 
also  consideration is given to target and actual asset allocations  inflation and real risk free return 
we believe the expected long term rate of return of for our domestic plan and for our foreign plan to be reasonable 
actual returns on plan assets for and  respectively  approximated and for our domestic plan and and for our foreign plan 
because of deteriorating conditions in the financial markets during the year  we do not believe current returns to be indicative of future investment returns 
the discount rates used in determining future pension obligations and other postretirement benefits for each of our plans are based on rates of return on high quality fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension and other postretirement benefits 
high quality fixed income investments are defined as those investments which have received one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency with maturities of years 
we believe the assumed discount rates of and as of december  for our domestic and foreign plans  respectively  to be reasonable 
we believe that the amounts recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are based on appropriate assumptions although actual outcomes could differ 
a percentage point decrease in the expected long term rate of return would increase annual pension expense by approximately  a percentage point decrease in the discount rate would increase projected and accumulated benefit obligations by approximately  conversely  an increase in the expected long term rate of return would decrease annual pension expense and an increase in the discount rate would decrease projected and accumulated benefit obligations see note to consolidated financial statements 
property  plant and equipment are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the long lived assets may not be recoverable 
if the undiscounted cash flows generated from the use and eventual disposition of the assets are less than their carrying value  then the asset value may not be fully recoverable potentially resulting in a write down of the asset value 
estimates of future cash flows are based on expected market conditions over the remaining useful life of the primary asset s 
accordingly  assumptions are made about pricing  volume and asset resale values 
actual results may differ from these assumptions 
we believe the amounts recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for property  plant and equipment are recoverable and are not impaired as of december  litigation and loss contingency accruals are made when it is determined that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
specifically  we and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in various claims and lawsuits incidental to their businesses 
in addition  claims have been asserted alleging asbestos liability and alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos containing components historically used in some products of an inactive subsidiary in dissolution 
other than an accrual for certain deductible features of relevant insurance policies  prior to  we had not accrued for settlement or defense costs for pending asbestos liability claims or asbestos liability claims that may be asserted in the future since we did not have sufficient information to make a reasonable estimate 
to assist us in determining whether an estimate could be made of the potential liability for pending and unasserted future claims for asbestos liability along with applicable insurance coverage  and the amounts of any estimates  we hired a nationally recognized asbestos liability expert and insurance consultants 
the asbestos liability expert was not requested to estimate asbestos claims against the inactive subsidiary in dissolution  which we believe are immaterial 
based on their analyses  in and  we established reserves for the probable and reasonably estimable costs of asbestos liabilities  including defense costs  through and  respectively  and also established receivables for the insurance recoveries that were deemed probable 
these amounts relied on assumptions which were based on currently known facts and strategy 
ampco pittsburgh annual report in  we undertook another review of our asbestos liability claims  defense costs and the likelihood for insurance recoveries and determined that litigation costs net of insurance recoveries could be reasonably estimated through december causing an additional provision of  actual expenses or insurance recoveries could be significantly higher or lower than those recorded if assumptions used in the calculations vary significantly from actual results 
key variables in these assumptions are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements and include the number and type of new claims to be filed each year  the average cost of disposing of each new claim  average annual defense costs  the resolution of coverage issues with insurance carriers  and the solvency risk with respect to the relevant insurance carriers 
other factors that may affect our asbestos liability and ability to recover under our insurance policies include uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case  reforms that may be made by state and federal courts  and the passage of state or federal tort reform legislation 
we intend to evaluate our estimated asbestos liability and related insurance receivables as well as the underlying assumptions on a regular basis to determine whether any adjustments to the estimates are required 
due to the uncertainties surrounding asbestos litigation and insurance  these regular reviews may result in the incurrence of future charges  however  we are currently unable to estimate such future charges 
adjustments  if any  to our estimate of our recorded asbestos liability and or insurance receivables could be material to the operating results for the periods in which the adjustments to the liability or receivable are recorded  and to our liquidity and consolidated financial position 
environmental exposures are difficult to assess and estimate for numerous reasons including lack of reliable data  the multiplicity of possible solutions  the years of remedial and monitoring activity required and the identification of new sites 
we believe the potential liability for all environmental proceedings based on information known to date has been adequately reserved see note to consolidated financial statements 
accounting for income taxes includes management s evaluation of the underlying accounts  permanent and temporary differences  our tax filing positions and interpretations of existing tax law 
a valuation allowance is recorded against deferred income tax assets to reduce them to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in doing so  assumptions are made about the future profitability of our operations and the nature of that profitability 
actual results may differ from these assumptions 
if we determined we would not be able to realize all or part of the deferred income tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be established resulting in a charge to net income 
likewise  if we determined we would be able to realize deferred income tax assets in excess of the net amount recorded  we would release a portion of the existing valuation allowance resulting in an increase in net income 
as of december   we have deferred income tax assets approximating  and a valuation allowance of  we do not recognize a tax benefit in the financial statements related to a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return unless it is more likely than not that the tax authorities will sustain the tax position solely on the basis of the position s technical merits 
consideration is given primarily to legislation and statutes  legislative intent  regulations  rulings and case law as well as their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position when assessing the sustainability of the tax position 
in the event a tax position no longer meets the more likely than not criteria  we would reverse the tax benefit by recognizing a liability and recording a charge to earnings 
conversely  if we subsequently determined that a tax position meets the more likely than not criteria  we would recognize the tax benefit by reducing the liability and recording a credit to earnings 
as of december   based on information known to date  we believe the amount of unrecognized tax benefits of for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return which may be challenged by the tax authorities is adequate 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
accounting for stock based compensation is based on the fair value of the stock options on the date of grant 
the fair value is affected by our stock price and various assumptions including assumptions about the expected term of the options  volatility  dividends and the risk free interest rate 
if the fair value of granted stock options was re determined  on a date other than the date of grant  the resulting fair value would differ 
accordingly  the fair value of stock options granted to date is not indicative of the fair value of stock options to be granted in the future see note to consolidated financial statements

ampco pittsburgh annual report item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we view our primary market risk exposures as relating to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
to manage certain foreign currency exchange exposures  our policy is to hedge a portion of our foreign currency denominated sales and receivables  primarily us sales denominated in euros and us sales denominated in us dollars and euros 
although strengthening of the us dollar could result in a lower volume of exports from the us and at reduced margins  it is expected that some exports of our foreign operation may increase and gross margins might improve 
additionally  strengthening of the british pound could result in a lower volume of exports from the uk and at reduced margins  however  it is expected that exports for our domestic operations may increase and gross margins might improve 
a weakening of the euro  as compared to the us dollar and british pound  could result in a lower volume of exports and at reduced margins 
to reduce the effect of price changes for certain of our raw materials and energy  we enter into contracts for particular commodities copper and aluminum and purchase a portion of our energy usage in advance 
based on estimated annual purchases  a fluctuation in commodity prices including electricity  natural gas not purchased in advance  steel scrap and ferroalloys would have an impact of approximately  and  in and  respectively  with the increase between the two years partially being attributable to higher raw material costs 
there is no guarantee that fluctuations in commodity prices will be limited to 
the ability to pass on increases in the price of commodities to the customer is contingent upon current market conditions with us potentially having to absorb some portion of such increase 
however  a sales price surcharge mechanism is in place with a majority of the customers of the forged and cast rolls segment which helps to protect us against the volatility in the cost of certain raw materials
