item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reference is made throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to notes included in our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this report 
overview company overview we are a leading supplier of equipment used in the global papermaking and paper recycling industries and a manufacturer of granules made from papermaking byproducts 
our continuing operations are comprised of one reportable operating segment papermaking systems  and a separate product line  fiber based products 
through our papermaking systems segment  we develop  manufacture  and market a range of equipment and products primarily for the global papermaking  paper recycling  and process industries 
we have a large customer base that includes most of the world s major paper manufacturers 
we believe our large installed base provides us 
table of contents kadant inc annual report with a spare parts and consumables business that yields higher margins than our capital equipment business 
on may   our kadant johnson europe bv subsidiary acquired all the stock of m clean papertech holding ab m clean  a european based supplier of equipment used to clean paper machine fabrics and rolls 
the aggregate purchase price for this acquisition was million 
the purchase price included million of cash acquired and million of debt assumed 
we believe that the acquisition of this business will enhance our papermaking systems segment s water management product offerings  strengthen our market position in europe and china  and offer growth opportunities in north america 
through our fiber based products business  we manufacture and sell granules derived from pulp fiber for use as carriers for agricultural  home lawn and garden  and professional lawn  turf and ornamental applications  as well as for oil and grease absorption 
international sales during and  approximately and  respectively  of our sales were to customers outside the united states  principally in europe and china 
we generally seek to charge our customers in the same currency in which our operating costs are incurred 
however  our financial performance and competitive position can be affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations affecting the relationship between the us dollar and foreign currencies 
we seek to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations through the use of forward currency exchange contracts 
we may enter into forward contracts to hedge certain firm purchase and sale commitments denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries functional currencies 
these contracts hedge transactions principally denominated in us dollars 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that entail significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies upon which our financial position depends  and which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments  are those described below 
for a discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable 
we enter into arrangements with customers that have multiple deliverables  such as equipment and installation  and we recognize revenues and profits on certain long term contracts using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
revenue recognition methods 
we recognize revenue under accounting standards codification asc  revenue recognition asc  when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or service has been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
under asc  when the terms of sale include customer acceptance provisions  and compliance with those provisions cannot be demonstrated until customer acceptance  we recognize revenues upon such acceptance 
provisions for discounts  warranties  returns  and other adjustments are provided for in the period in which the related sales are recorded 
when a sale arrangement involves multiple elements  such as equipment and installation  we consider the guidance in asc such transactions are evaluated to determine whether the deliverables in the arrangement represent separate units of accounting based on the following criteria the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone basis  and if the contract includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item  delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially under our control 
revenue is allocated to each unit of 
table of contents kadant inc annual report accounting or element based on relative selling prices 
we determine relative selling prices by using either vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if that exists  or third party evidence of selling price 
when neither vsoe or third party evidence of selling price exists for a deliverable  we use our best estimate of the selling price for that deliverable 
in cases in which elements cannot be treated as separate units of accounting  the elements are combined into a single unit of accounting for revenue recognition purposes 
the complexity of all issues related to the assumptions  risks  and uncertainties inherent in the application of asc affects the amounts reported as revenues in our consolidated financial statements 
under asc  we may not be able to reliably predict future revenues and profitability due to the difficulty of estimating when installation will be performed or when we will meet the contractually agreed upon performance tests  which can delay or prohibit recognition of revenues 
the determination of when we install the equipment or fulfill the performance guarantees is largely dependent on our customers  their willingness to allow installation of the equipment or performance of the appropriate tests in a timely manner  and their cooperation in addressing possible problems that would impede achievement of the performance guarantee criteria 
unexpected changes in the timing related to the completion of installation or performance guarantees could cause our revenues and earnings to be significantly affected 
percentage of completion 
revenues recorded under the percentage of completion method of accounting pursuant to asc were million in  million in  and million in we determine the percentage of completion by comparing the actual costs incurred to date to an estimate of total costs to be incurred on each contract 
if a loss is indicated on any contract in process  a provision is made currently for the entire loss 
our contracts generally provide for billing of customers upon the attainment of certain milestones specified in each contract 
revenues earned on contracts in process in excess of billings are classified as unbilled contract costs and fees  and amounts billed in excess of revenues are classified as billings in excess of contract costs and fees 
the estimation process under the percentage of completion method affects the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
a number of internal and external factors affect our percentage of completion and cost of sales estimates  including labor rate and efficiency variances  estimates of warranty costs  estimated future material prices from vendors  and customer specification and testing requirements 
in addition  we are exposed to the risk  primarily relating to our orders in china  that a customer will not comply with the order s contractual obligations to take delivery of the equipment 
the contractual obligations relating to the order may be difficult to enforce through a foreign country s legal system  which could result in a significant credit exposure in the period or periods that were to be affected by the breach of contract 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our estimates in the application of this accounting policy  if our actual results were to differ from our estimates  or if we were to use different assumptions  it is possible that materially different amounts could be reported as revenues in our consolidated financial statements 
we exercise judgment in determining our allowance for bad debts  which is based on our historical collection experience  current trends  credit policies  specific customer collection issues  and accounts receivable aging categories 
in determining this allowance  we look at historical writeoffs of our receivables 
we also look at current trends in the credit quality of our customer base as well as changes in our credit policies 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and each customer s current creditworthiness 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers 
in addition  in some instances we utilize letters of credit as a way to mitigate credit exposure 
while actual bad debts have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same rate of bad debts that we have had in the past 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any of our customers could result in the uncollectibility of the related accounts receivable and could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows in that period 

table of contents kadant inc annual report warranty obligations for continuing operations 
we offer warranties of various durations to our customers depending upon the specific product and terms of the customer purchase agreement 
we typically negotiate terms regarding warranty coverage and length of warranty depending on the products and their applications 
our standard mechanical warranties require us to repair or replace a defective product during the warranty period at no cost to the customer 
we record an estimate for warranty related costs at the time of sale based on our actual historical occurrence rates and repair costs  as well as other analytical tools for estimating future warranty claims 
these estimates are revised for variances between actual and expected claims rates 
while our warranty costs have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same warranty return rates or repair costs that we have in the past 
a significant increase in warranty occurrence rates or costs to repair our products would lead to an increase in the warranty provision and could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results for the period or periods in which such returns or additional costs occur 
warranty obligations for discontinued operation 
in  our composites llc subsidiary sold substantially all of its assets to a third party 
under the terms of the asset purchase agreement  composites llc retained certain liabilities associated with the operation of the business prior to the sale  including the warranty obligations related to products manufactured prior to the sale date 
composites llc retained all of the cash proceeds received from the asset sale and continued to administer and pay warranty claims from the sale proceeds into the third quarter of on september   composites llc announced that it no longer had sufficient funds to honor warranty claims  was unable to pay or process warranty claims  and ceased doing business 
all activity related to this business is classified in the results of the discontinued operation in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
on october   we  our composites llc subsidiary  and other co defendants entered into an agreement to settle a nationwide class action lawsuit related to defective composites decking building products manufactured by composites llc between april and october in connection with the settlement  we incurred a charge of million reported in loss from discontinued operation in as of year end  we accrued million for the payment of claims under the settlement 
if the actual claims submitted and approved under the settlement agreement exceed the amount of this reserve  we will reflect the amount of the additional claims paid in the results of the discontinued operation in future periods  up to a maximum of million as agreed in the settlement agreement 
we also accrued million as of year end for the payment of the plaintiffs legal fees and incentives to representatives of the class  as agreed in the settlement agreement 
income taxes 
we operate in numerous countries under many legal forms and  as a result  are subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non us tax authorities  as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments 
determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events  such as the amount  timing and character of deductions  permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits 
changes in tax laws  regulations  agreements and treaties  currency exchange restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and our results of operations 
we estimate the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction  and provide a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that we believe will more likely than not go unused 
if it were to become more likely than not that the tax assets or loss carryforwards would be used  we would reverse the related valuation allowance 
our tax valuation allowance totaled million at year end  including million in the us and million in foreign jurisdictions 
the million decrease in our valuation allowance in was related primarily to the release of a portion of the valuation allowance in the us and china 
should our actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from our estimate  additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary 
when assessing the need for a valuation allowance in a tax jurisdiction  we evaluate the weight of all available evidence to 
table of contents kadant inc annual report determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
as part of this evaluation  we consider our cumulative three year history of earnings before income taxes  taxable income in prior carryback years  future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  prudent and feasible tax planning strategies  and expected future results of operations 
as of year end  in the us and china  we were in a three year cumulative income position and expect income from operations in  as a result  we released our tax valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets in both jurisdictions 
as of year end  we continued to maintain a valuation allowance in the us primarily against all of our foreign tax credits due to the future uncertainty of foreign source income 
as of year end  we maintained a full valuation allowance in certain foreign jurisdictions because of the uncertainty of future profitability 
in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying our income tax positions 
it is our policy to provide for uncertain tax positions and the related interest and penalties based upon our assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
at december   we believe that we have appropriately accounted for any unrecognized tax benefits 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit is established or are required to pay amounts in excess of the liability  our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be affected 
we reinvest certain earnings of foreign operations indefinitely  and accordingly  we do not provide for income taxes that could result from the remittance of such earnings 
through year end  we have not provided for us income taxes on approximately million of unremitted foreign earnings 
the us tax cost has not been determined due to the fact that it is not practicable to estimate at this time 
the related foreign tax withholding  which would be required if we were to remit the foreign earnings to the us  would be approximately million 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of the end of each fiscal year  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances  such as a decline in sales  earnings  or cash flows  or material adverse changes in the business climate  indicate that the carrying value of an asset might be impaired 
goodwill is considered to be impaired when the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
in  we adopted a new accounting standards update asu that allows for the goodwill impairment analysis to start with an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the qualitative factors  we were to determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then we would perform a two step impairment test 
in the first step of the impairment test  fair values are primarily established using a discounted cash flow methodology specifically  the income approach 
the determination of discounted cash flows is based on our long range forecasts and requires assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth  asset related expenditures  working capital levels  and other factors 
the revenue growth rates included in the forecasts are our best estimates based on current and anticipated market conditions  and the profitability assumptions are projected based on current and anticipated cost structures 
long range forecasting involves uncertainty which increases with each successive period 
key assumptions  such as revenue growth rates and profitability  especially in the outer years involve a greater degree of uncertainty 
intangible assets subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset might be impaired 
no adjustment was required in  or to the carrying value of our goodwill or intangible assets subject to amortization based on the analyses performed 
our judgments and assumptions regarding the determination of the fair value of an intangible asset or goodwill associated with an acquired business could change as future events impact such fair values 
a prolonged economic downturn  weakness in demand for our products  especially capital equipment products  or contraction in capital spending by paper companies in our key markets  such as china  could negatively affect the revenue and profitability assumptions used in our assessment of goodwill and intangible assets  which could result in additional impairment charges 
any future impairment loss could have a material adverse affect on our long term assets and operating expenses in the period in which an impairment is determined to exist 

table of contents kadant inc annual report inventories 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost on a first in  first out  or weighted average basis or market value and include materials  labor  and manufacturing overhead 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and compare these amounts to historical and forecasted usage of and demand for each particular product or product line 
we record a charge to cost of revenues for excess and obsolete inventory to reduce the carrying value of the inventories to net realizable value 
inventory writedowns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established 
a significant decrease in demand for our products could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand  resulting in a charge for the writedown of that inventory in that period 
in addition  our estimates of future product usage or demand may prove to be inaccurate  resulting in an understated or overstated provision for excess and obsolete inventory 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product usage and demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
pension and other retiree benefits 
we sponsor a noncontributory defined benefit retirement plan for the benefit of eligible employees at our kadant solutions division and the corporate office 
our unfunded benefit obligation related to this plan totaled million at year end and the fair value of plan assets totaled million 
in addition  several of our us and us subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other retiree benefit plans with an aggregate unfunded benefit obligation of million at year end the cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working  the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease 
major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels 
assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with third party actuaries  and are evaluated each year as of the plans measurement date 
the fair value of plan assets is determined based on quoted market prices and observable market inputs 
the unrecognized actuarial loss associated with these plans totaled million at year end  million of which we expect to recognize in should any of these assumptions change  they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation 
the projected benefit obligation and expense associated with these plans are sensitive to changes in the discount rate 
for the noncontributory benefit retirement plan at our kadant solutions division  a basis point decrease in the discount rate would have resulted in an increase in pension expense of million and an increase in the projected benefit obligation of million 
derivatives 
we use derivative instruments primarily to reduce our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates 
when we enter into a derivative contract  we make a determination as to whether the transaction is deemed to be a hedge for accounting purposes 
for contracts deemed to be a hedge  we formally document the relationship between the derivative instrument and the risk being hedged 
in this documentation  we specifically identify the asset  liability  forecasted transaction  cash flow  or net investment that has been designated as the hedged item  and evaluate whether the derivative instrument is expected to reduce the risks associated with the hedged item 
to the extent these criteria are not met  we do not use hedge accounting for the derivative 
asc  derivatives and hedging  requires that all derivatives be recognized on the balance sheet at fair value 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  the related gains or losses on these contracts are deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive items 
these deferred gains and losses are recognized in the period in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs 
for derivatives designated as fair value hedges  the unrealized gains and losses resulting from the impact of currency exchange rate movements are recognized in earnings in the period in which the exchange rates change and offset the currency gains and losses on the underlying exposures being hedged 
we perform an evaluation of the effectiveness of the hedge both at inception and on an ongoing basis 
the ineffective portion of a hedge  if any  and changes in the fair value of a derivative not deemed to be a hedge  are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations 

table of contents kadant inc annual report we use interest rate swap agreements to hedge our exposure to variable rate debt and have designated these agreements as cash flow hedges of the forecasted interest payments 
the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements are included in other assets for unrecognized gains and in other liabilities for unrecognized losses  with an offset in accumulated other comprehensive items net of tax 
we use forward currency exchange contracts primarily to hedge certain operational cash flow hedges and balance sheet fair value hedges exposures resulting from fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
such exposures primarily result from portions of our operations and assets that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the businesses conducting the operations or holding the assets 
as part of our overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of currency exchange fluctuations  some of our subsidiaries hedge a portion of their currency exposures anticipated over the ensuing month period  using forward currency exchange contracts that have maturities of months or less 
we do not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management 
industry and business outlook our products are sold primarily to the global pulp and paper industry 
in north america  the united states economy experienced modest growth in the fourth quarter of and given the recent slowdown in china and uncertainty in europe  the united states has recently emerged as one of the stronger regions in the world for our products 
operating rates for us containerboard and tissue producers  which make up a substantial portion of our revenues  were estimated to be in the mid s for overall  we believe that higher mill operating rates lead to increased demand for our spare parts and consumables products 
many paper producers are also facing increases in input costs  particularly with respect to fiber and energy 
in many cases  we believe increased input costs will benefit our business since the return on investment of many of our products is based on increasing fiber yield and lowering energy costs 
our revenues in north america increased million  or  while bookings increased compared to last year as a result of increased capital business principally in the stock preparation product line and  to a lesser extent  increased parts and consumables business 
in europe  despite an uncertain economic environment  we experienced growth in both revenues and bookings in compared to the prior year 
revenues in europe increased million  or in compared to  while bookings increased compared to the same period  but declined for the last few quarters in as the economy in europe slowed 
our european businesses serve other parts of the world outside western europe including the middle east  india  southeast asia and parts of south america 
the macroeconomic conditions in western europe currently are weak and could adversely affect our business 
in china  our revenues increased significantly in partly due to large stock preparation capital orders booked in late  some of which were shipped in revenues in china increased million  or in compared to the prior year 
however  our bookings in china decreased in compared to the prior year 
bookings and revenues in china tend to be more variable compared to other regions in which we operate due to the larger proportions of capital orders there 
some paper companies in china are scheduled to bring online significant capacity additions in  which could lead to short term overcapacity in some grades 
this could potentially impact the timing of our orders from paper companies as the additional capacity is absorbed 
in addition  some of the larger paper producers in china announced delays in in new capacity start ups in reaction to the softer market conditions 
we are anticipating recognizing significant revenues from china in the first half of from orders previously received  although the timing of this revenue is dependent on customer requested delivery dates and the receipt of payments 
our revenue recognition in china can be quite variable from period to period because we generally recognize revenue there on the completed contract method 
we continuously consider initiatives to improve our operating results and are currently concentrating our efforts on the following initiatives focusing on higher growth emerging markets  further penetrating existing markets where we see opportunity  growing our market share in low share regions  increasing our parts and consumables sales  and leveraging our low cost manufacturing operations in locations such as china and mexico 
we also continue to focus our efforts on managing our operating costs and working capital 

table of contents kadant inc annual report we anticipate our consolidated gross margin will be between and  slightly below the full year gross margins of 
there is likely to be considerable quarterly variability due in part to the projected product mix 
in addition  although we see good project activity to start in some of our markets  we are concerned about the macroeconomic environment  particularly in europe and china  where we have seen softening of demand in some product lines 
for the first quarter of  we expect to achieve diluted earnings per share eps of

papermaking systems segment by product line 
the following table presents revenues for our papermaking systems segment by product line  the changes in revenues by product line between and  and the changes in revenues by product line between and excluding the effect of currency translation 
the increase in revenues excluding the effect of currency translation represents the increase resulting from the conversion of revenues in local currency into us dollars at the exchange rates  and then comparing this result to the actual revenues in the presentation of the changes in revenues by product line excluding the effect of currency translation is a non gaap generally accepted accounting principles measure 
we believe this non gaap measure helps investors gain a better understanding of our underlying operations  consistent with how management measures and forecasts our performance  especially when comparing such results to prior periods 
this non gaap measure should not be considered superior to or a substitute for the corresponding gaap measure

papermaking systems segment 
the gross profit margin at the papermaking systems segment decreased to in from in this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in gross profit margins in our stock preparation product line due to a shift in our product mix towards lower margin capital products 
also contributing to the decrease in gross profit margins were lower margins in our water management product line partly due to our newly acquired m clean business

recent accounting pronouncements intangibles goodwill and other 
in september  the fasb issued asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing for impairment 
the objective of this update is to simplify how entities test goodwill for impairment 
under the amendments in this update  an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it 
table of contents kadant inc annual report is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
however  if an entity concludes otherwise  then it is required to perform the first step of the two step impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit  as described in topic if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the entity is required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any  as described in topic under the amendments in this update  an entity has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the first step of the two step goodwill impairment test 
an entity may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 
the amendments in this update are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december   although early adoption is permitted 
we adopted this asu in fiscal adoption of this new guidance did not have an impact on our results of operations or financial position 
comprehensive income 
in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income 
the new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of stockholders equity 
instead  the new rule will require an entity to present net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement  referred to as the statement of comprehensive income  or in two separate but consecutive statements 
while the new guidance changes the presentation of comprehensive income  there are no changes to the components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under current accounting guidance 
in addition  in december  the fasb issued an amendment to this accounting standard which defers the requirement to present certain components of reclassifications of other comprehensive income on the face of the income statement for all periods presented 
during the deferral  entities should continue to report reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income consistent with the presentation requirements in effect prior to the issuance of this amendment 
this new guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  while the adoption of this new guidance will change the presentation of comprehensive income  it will not have an impact on our results of operations or financial position

the 
table of contents kadant inc annual report increase in revenues excluding the effect of currency translation represents the increase resulting from the conversion of revenues in local currency into us dollars at the exchange rates  and then comparing this result to the actual revenues in the presentation of the changes in revenues by product line excluding the effect of currency translation is a non gaap measure

in the second quarter of  we implemented a one time cash repatriation plan to ensure that we would continue to remain in compliance with these financial covenants 
under this plan  we repatriated million of cash in from our foreign subsidiaries  which was used to repay a portion of our outstanding debt obligations in the us and china 
it is our intention to reinvest indefinitely the remaining earnings of our international subsidiaries in order to support the current and future capital needs of their operations 
through year end  we have not provided for us income taxes on approximately million of unremitted foreign earnings 
the us tax cost has not been determined due to the fact that it is not practicable to estimate at this time 
the related foreign tax withholding  which would be required if we remitted the foreign earnings to the us  would be approximately million 
it is our policy to provide for uncertain tax positions and the related interest and penalties based upon management s assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
at december   we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits and an accrual for the payment of interest and penalties totaling million 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit is established or are required to pay amounts in excess of the liability  our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be affected 
in connection with the settlement of the class action lawsuit related to our discontinued composites building products business  we incurred a charge of million reported in loss from discontinued operation in as of year end  we accrued million for the payment of claims under the settlement 
if the actual claims submitted and approved under the settlement agreement exceed the amount of this reserve  we will reflect the amount of the additional claims paid in the results of the discontinued operation in future periods  up to a maximum of million as agreed in the settlement agreement 
although we currently have no material commitments for capital expenditures  we plan to make expenditures of approximately to million during for property  plant  and equipment 
in the future  our liquidity position will be primarily affected by the level of cash flows from operations  cash paid to satisfy debt repayments  capital projects  stock repurchases  or additional acquisitions  if any 
we believe that our existing resources  together with the cash available from our credit facilities and the cash we expect to generate from continuing operations  will be sufficient to meet the capital requirements of our current operations for the foreseeable future 

table of contents kadant inc annual report contractual obligations and other commercial commitments the following table summarizes our known contractual obligations and commercial commitments to make future payments or other consideration pursuant to certain contracts as of year end  as well as an estimate of the timing in which these obligations are expected to be satisfied 
detailed information concerning these obligations and commitments can be found in notes  and to our consolidated financial statements 
payments due by period or expiration of commitment in millions less than year years years after years total contractual obligations and other commitments a b long term debt obligations interest c operating lease obligations acquisition consideration letters of credit total d e a we have purchase obligations related to the acquisition of raw material made in the ordinary course of business that may be terminated with minimal notice and are excluded from this table 
b in the ordinary course of business  certain contracts contain limited performance guarantees  which do not require letters of credit  relating to our equipment and systems 
we typically limit our liability under these guarantees to amounts that would not exceed the value of the contract 
we believe that we have adequate reserves for any potential liability in connection with such guarantees 
these guarantees are not included in this table 
c amounts assume interest rates on variable rate debt remain unchanged from rates as of year end d this table excludes million of accrued restructuring costs 
the table also excludes million of accrued pension and other post retirement benefits  as these liabilities are not subject to fixed payment terms 
in addition  the table excludes an unrealized loss of million associated with our interest rate swap agreements as this amount would only be owed if the counterparty demanded an early termination of the agreements in the event of a default under our credit agreement 
e this table excludes a liability for unrecognized tax benefits and an accrual for the payment of interest and penalties totaling million 
due to the uncertain nature of these tax matters  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to if and when cash settlements with the appropriate taxing authorities will occur 
provisions in financial guarantees or commitments  debt or lease agreements  or other arrangements could trigger a requirement for an early payment  additional collateral support  amended terms  or acceleration of maturity 
we do not have special purpose entities nor do we use off balance sheet financing arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which could affect our future results of operations and financial condition 
we manage our exposure to these risks through our regular operating and financing activities 
we entered into receive variable pay fixed swap agreements in and to hedge our exposure to variable rate long term debt 
additionally  we use short term forward contracts to manage certain exposures to foreign currencies 
we enter into forward currency exchange contracts to hedge firm purchase and sale commitments denominated in currencies other than our 
table of contents kadant inc annual report subsidiaries local currencies 
we do not engage in extensive foreign currency hedging activities  however  the purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect our local currency cash flows related to these commitments from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
our forward currency exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in us dollars 
gains and losses arising from forward contracts are recognized as offsets to gains and losses resulting from the transactions being hedged 
we do not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management 
interest rates our cash and cash equivalents are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
interest rate changes would result in a change in interest income due to the difference between the current interest rates on cash and cash equivalents and the variable rates to which these financial instruments may adjust in the future 
a decrease in year end interest rates would have resulted in an immaterial impact on net income in both and our outstanding debt and interest rate swap agreements are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
we hedged million and million of our debt at year end and  respectively  with receive variable pay fixed swap agreements 
the fair values of the swap agreements are sensitive to changes in the month libor forward curve 
a decrease in the month libor forward curve would have resulted in an immaterial impact on unrealized losses at year end and an increase in unrealized losses of million as of year end the remaining unhedged portion of the debt totaling million at year end was sensitive to changes in interest rates 
as of year end  the interest rate on the unhedged portion of our us debt was based on libor 
a increase in the year end rates would have had an immaterial impact on our net income 
currency exchange rates we generally view our investment in foreign subsidiaries in a functional currency other than our reporting currency as long term 
our investment in foreign subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries are principally denominated in euros  british pounds sterling  mexican pesos  canadian dollars  chinese renminbi  brazilian reals  and swedish kroner 
the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive items component of shareholders investment 
a decrease in functional currencies at year end and  relative to the us dollar  would have resulted in a reduction in shareholders investment of million and million  respectively 
the fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is sensitive to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is the estimated amount that we would pay or receive upon termination of the contracts  taking into account the change in foreign currency exchange rates 
a decrease in year end and foreign currency exchange rates related to our contracts would have resulted in an increase in unrealized losses on forward currency exchange contracts of million and million in and  respectively 
since we use forward currency exchange contracts as hedges of firm purchase and sale commitments  the unrealized gain or loss on forward currency exchange contracts resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates would be offset primarily by corresponding changes in the fair value of the hedged items
