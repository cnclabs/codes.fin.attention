item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our discussion below of our results includes certain non gaap financial measures that we believe provide important perspective with respect to underlying business trends 
any non gaap financial measure will be denoted as an adjusted measure and excludes expenses from our business transformation project  from withdrawals from multiemployer pension plans  restructuring charges  corporate owned life insurance policies coli policies  recognized tax benefits and the impact of the rd week in fiscal more information on the rationale for the use of these measures and reconciliations to gaap numbers can be found under non gaap reconciliations 
overview sysco distributes food and related products to restaurants  healthcare and educational facilities  lodging establishments and other foodservice customers 
our operations are primarily located throughout the united states  canada and ireland and include broadline companies which include our custom cut meat operations  sygma our chain restaurant distribution subsidiary  specialty produce companies  hotel supply operations  a company that distributes specialty imported products and a company that distributes to international customers 
we consider our primary market to be the foodservice market in the united states and canada and estimate that we serve about of this approximately billion annual market 
according to industry sources  the foodservice  or food away from home  market represents approximately of the total dollars spent on food purchases made at the consumer level in the united states 
industry sources estimate the total foodservice market in the united states experienced a real sales decline of approximately in calendar year and in calendar year real sales declines do not include the impact of inflation or deflation 
general economic conditions and consumer confidence can affect the frequency of purchases and amounts spent by consumers for food away from home and  in turn  can impact our customers and our sales 
we believe the current general economic conditions  including pressure on consumer disposable income  have contributed to a decline in the foodservice market 
historically  we have grown at a faster rate than the overall industry and believe we have continued to grow our market share in this fragmented industry 
highlights high levels of product costs and an uneven economic recovery contributed to a challenging business environment in fiscal our case volume growth has shown modest improvement in a low growth market environment 
however  our earnings declined due to high levels of inflation and rising operating expenses  driven in part by our expenses related to our business transformation project 
comparison of results from fiscal to fiscal sales increased to billion primarily due to increased prices due to inflation and secondarily from case volume growth 
operating income decreased  or million  to billion  primarily driven by lower gross margins and increased operating expenses partially from increased expenses from payroll and our business transformation project 
these expense increases were partially offset by increases in gross profit dollars 
adjusted operating income increased  or million 
net earnings decreased to billion primarily due to the decline in operating income 
adjusted net earnings increased  or million 
basic and diluted earnings per share in fiscal were and  respectively 
this represents a decrease from the comparable prior year period amount for basic earnings per share of per share and a decrease from the comparable prior year period amount for diluted earnings per share of 
adjusted diluted earnings per share were in fiscal and in fiscal  an increase of 
see non gaap reconciliations for an explanation of these non gaap financial measures 
trends and strategy trends general economic conditions and consumer confidence can affect the frequency of purchases and amounts spent by consumers for food away from home and  in turn  can impact our customers and our sales 
we believe the current general economic conditions  including pressure on consumer disposable income  have contributed to a slow rate of recovery in the foodservice market 
according to industry sources  real sales for the total foodservice market in the united states are not expected to grow significantly over the next year 
we experienced prolonged levels of high product cost inflation during most of fiscal as compared to fiscal our product cost inflation reached a high of in the first quarter of fiscal and a low of in the fourth quarter of fiscal while we are generally able to pass on modest levels of inflation to our customers  we were unable to fully pass through these higher levels of product cost inflation with the same gross margin percentage without negatively impacting our customers business and therefore our business 
in the summer months of  certain agricultural areas of the united states have experienced severe drought 
the impact of this drought is uncertain and could result in volatile input costs 
input costs could increase at any point in time for a large portion of the products that we sell for a prolonged period 
while we cannot predict whether inflation will continue at current levels  periods of high inflation  either overall or in certain product categories  can have a negative impact on us and our customers  as high food costs can reduce consumer spending in the food away from home market  and may negatively impact our sales  gross profit  operating income and earnings 
we have experienced higher operating costs this fiscal year 
some of the increase has resulted from increased pay related expenses 
sales compensation includes commissions which are driven by gross profit dollars and case volumes  and delivery compensation includes activity based pay which is driven by case volumes 
since these drivers are variable in nature  increased gross profit dollars and case volumes have increased sales and delivery compensation 
we believe pay related expense could continue to increase if gross profit dollars and case volumes increase  however  the impact of our productivity related initiatives could favorably impact the magnitude of this trend 
fuel costs are expected to stabilize provided that fuel prices do not significantly change from their current levels 
our business transformation project is a key part of our strategy to control costs and grow our market share over the long term 
this project includes an integrated software system that went into deployment in august we believe expenses related to the project will increase in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to amortization of the software asset and increased deployment costs 
net company sponsored pension costs for our retirement plan have experienced volatility over the past five years primarily due to changes in interest rates which are used to determine the discount rates for our pension obligations and our pension asset performance 
for most of these periods  we have experienced significantly increased pension expense 
at the end of fiscal  sysco decided to freeze future benefit accruals under the retirement plan as of december  for all us based salaried and non union hourly employees 
effective january   these employees will be eligible for additional contributions under an enhanced  defined contribution plan 
pension costs will decrease in fiscal primarily due to this plan freeze 
our expenses related to our defined contribution plan will increase in fiscal and will more than offset our reduced pension costs  however  over the long term  we believe the changes to both plans will result in reduced volatility of retirement related expenses and a reduction in total retirement related expenses 
strategy we are focused on optimizing our core broadline business in the us and canada  while continuing to explore appropriate opportunities to profitably grow our market share and create shareholder value by expanding beyond our core business 
day to day  our business decisions are driven by our mission to market and deliver great products to our customers with exceptional service  with the aspirational vision of becoming each of our customers most valued and trusted business partner 
we have identified five strategies to help us achieve our mission and vision profoundly enrich the experience of doing business with sysco our primary focus is to help our customers succeed 
we believe that by building on our current competitive advantages  we will be able to further differentiate our offering to customers 
our competitive advantages include our sales force of over  marketing associates  our diversified product base  which includes quality assured sysco brand products  the suite of services we provide to our customers such as business reviews and menu analysis  and our wide geographic presence in the united states and canada 
in addition  we have a portfolio of businesses spanning broadline  specialty meat  chain restaurant distribution  specialty produce  hotel amenities  specialty import and export which serves our customers needs across a wide array of business segments 
we believe this strategy of enriching the experience of doing business with sysco will increase customer retention and profitably accelerate sales growth with both existing and new customers 
continuously improve productivity in all areas of our business our multi year business transformation project is designed to improve productivity and reduce costs 
an integrated software system is included in this project and will support a majority of our business processes to further streamline our operations and reduce costs 
these systems are commonly referred to as enterprise resource planning erp systems 
we view the technology as an important enabler of this project  however the larger outcome of this project will be from transformed processes that standardize portions of our operations 
this includes a shared business service center to centrally manage certain back office functions that are currently performed at a majority of our operating companies 
this project also includes removing costs from our operations through improved productivity without impacting our service to our customers 
we continue to optimize warehouse and delivery activities across the corporation to achieve a more efficient delivery of products to our customers and we seek to improve sales productivity and lower general and administrative costs 
we also have a product cost reduction initiative to provide the right products to our customers while leveraging our purchasing power 
expand our portfolio of products and services by initiating a customer centric innovation program we continually explore opportunities to provide new and improved products  technologies and services to our customers 
explore  assess and pursue new businesses and markets this strategy is focused on identifying opportunities to expand the core business through growth in new international markets and in adjacent areas that complement our core foodservice distribution business 
as a part of our ongoing strategic analysis  we regularly evaluate business opportunities  including potential acquisitions and sales of assets and businesses 
develop and effectively integrate a comprehensive  enterprise wide talent management process our ability to drive results and grow our business is directly linked to having the best talent in the industry 
we are committed to the continued enhancement of our talent management programs in terms of how we recruit  select  train and develop our associates throughout sysco as well as succession planning 
our ultimate objective is to provide our associates with outstanding opportunities for professional growth and career development 
business transformation project in fiscal  we commenced our business transformation project  which currently consists of three main components the design and deployment of an erp system to implement an integrated software system to support a majority of our business processes and further streamline our operations  a cost transformation initiative to lower our cost structure  and a product cost reduction initiative to use market data and customer insights to make changes to product pricing and product assortment issues 
in fiscal  we continued to refine our erp system after implementing it at two pilot operating companies 
the system has been deployed to three operating companies and we are targeting to convert to us broadline operating companies in fiscal our next five conversions will be in texas and louisiana 
we believe future conversions will be to us broadline operating companies per year from fiscal to fiscal although we expect the investment in the erp system within our business transformation project to provide meaningful benefits to the company over the long term  the costs will exceed the benefits during fiscal expenses related to the business transformation project were million in fiscal or per share  million in fiscal or per share and million in fiscal or per share 
we anticipate that project expenses for fiscal will continue to significantly increase primarily due to the initiation of software amortization as the system was placed into service in august our costs will also increase from the ramp up of our shared services center  continuing costs for deployment of the software platform and information technology support costs 
some of these increased costs will be partially offset by benefits obtained from the project  primarily in reduced headcount  however the costs will exceed the benefits in fiscal our cost transformation initiative seeks to lower our cost structure by million to million annually by fiscal these include initiatives to increase our productivity in the warehouse and delivery activities including fleet management and maintenance activities 
it also involves improving sales productivity and reducing general and administrative expenses  partially through aligning compensation and benefit plans 
our product cost reduction initiative is designed to lower our total product costs by million to million annually by fiscal this initiative involves the use of market data and customer insights to make changes to product pricing and product assortment 
we believe there are opportunities to more effectively provide the products that our customers want  to benefit from our purchasing power and to create mutually beneficial partnerships with our suppliers 
we believe that procuring greater quantities with select vendors will result in reduced prices for our product purchases 
we expect our expenses related to the business transformation project for fiscal to be approximately million to million net of benefits obtained from our shared services center 
we expect our capital expenditures related to this project to be approximately million to million 
in fiscal  we believe we can obtain approximately of the total expected annualized benefits of million to million 
if we are successful in obtaining these benefits in fiscal  some of the trends noted above could be favorably impacted 
results of operations the following table sets forth the components of our consolidated results of operations expressed as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated weeks sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses operating income interest expense other expense income  net earnings before income taxes income taxes net earnings the following table sets forth the change in the components of our consolidated results of operations expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the prior year sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses operating income interest expense other expense income  net earnings before income taxes income taxes net earnings basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share average shares outstanding diluted shares outstanding other expense income  net was income of million in fiscal  income of million in fiscal and expense of million in fiscal sales sales for fiscal were higher than fiscal sales for fiscal increased as a result of product cost inflation  and the resulting increase in selling prices  along with improving case volumes

sales from acquisitions in the last months favorably impacted sales by for fiscal the changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars did not have a significant impact on sales when compared to fiscal sales for fiscal were higher than fiscal after adjusting for the estimated impact of the rd week in fiscal  the adjusted increase in sales in fiscal would have been

operating expenses include the costs of facilities  product handling  delivery  selling and general and administrative activities 
fuel surcharges are reflected within sales and gross profit  fuel costs are reflected within operating expenses 
fiscal vs 
fiscal operating income decreased in fiscal over fiscal to billion  and as a percentage of sales  decreased to of sales 
this decrease was primarily driven by declines in gross margin and increased operating expenses partially from increased expenses from payroll and our business transformation project 
these expense increases were partially offset by increases in gross profit dollars 
gross profit dollars increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal  and operating expenses increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal adjusted operating income increased  or million  during fiscal gross profit dollars increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to increased sales 
gross margin  which is gross profit as a percentage of sales  was in fiscal  a decline of basis points from the gross margin of in fiscal this decline in gross margin was primarily the result of product cost inflation 
other factors contributing to our gross margin decline were competitive pressures on pricing  segment mix changes where certain of our lower margin segments grew faster than our broadline segment and our own strategy to gain market share 
sysco s product cost inflation was estimated as inflation of during fiscal based on our product sales mix for fiscal  we were most impacted by higher levels of inflation in the meat  canned and dry and frozen product categories in the range of to 
our product cost inflation reached a high of in the first quarter of fiscal and a low of in the fourth quarter of fiscal while we are generally able to pass through modest levels of inflation to our customers  we were unable to fully pass through these higher levels of product cost inflation with the same gross margin in these product categories without negatively impacting our customers business and therefore our business 
in the summer months of  certain agricultural areas of the united states have experienced severe drought 
the impact of this drought is uncertain and could result in volatile input costs 
input costs could increase at any point in time for a large portion of the products that we sell for a prolonged period 
while we cannot predict whether inflation will continue at these levels  prolonged periods of high inflation  either overall or in certain product categories  can have a negative impact on us and our customers  as high food costs can reduce consumer spending in the food away from home market  and may negatively impact our sales  gross profit and earnings 
our product cost reduction initiative is designed to lower our total product costs by million to million annually by fiscal  however we believe the impact on our product costs in fiscal will be modest 
gross profit dollars for fiscal also increased as a result of higher fuel surcharges 
fuel surcharges were approximately million higher in fiscal than in fiscal due to higher fuel prices incurred during fiscal and the application of fuel surcharges to a broader customer base for the entire fiscal period 
assuming that fuel prices do not greatly vary from recent levels  we expect the level of fuel surcharges in fiscal to remain consistent with those experienced in fiscal operating expenses for fiscal increased primarily due to increased pay related expenses  increased expenses related to our business transformation project  increased fuel costs and an unfavorable year over year comparison on the amounts recorded to adjust the carrying value of coli policies to their cash surrender values as compared to the prior year period 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in net company sponsored pension costs and lower provisions related to multiemployer pension plans 
adjusted operating expenses increased  or million  in fiscal over fiscal pay related expenses  excluding labor costs associated with our business transformation project  increased by million in fiscal over fiscal the increase was primarily due to increased sales and delivery compensation and added costs from companies acquired within the last months 
sales compensation includes commissions which are driven by gross profit dollars and case volumes  and delivery compensation includes activity based pay which is driven by case volumes 
since these drivers are variable in nature  increased gross profit dollars and cases volumes will increase sales and delivery compensation 
however  the impact of our productivity related initiatives could favorably impact the magnitude of this trend 
also contributing to the increase was a restructuring charge related to severance incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal of million 
expenses related to our business transformation project  inclusive of pay related expense  were million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing an increase of million 
the increase in fiscal resulted from increased project spending  reduced capitalization of expenditures and expenses due to the ramp up of our shared services center 
we anticipate that project expenses for fiscal will continue to increase primarily due to the initiation of software amortization as the system was placed into service in august additionally  the majority of the expenditures forecasted for fiscal will be expensed as the company is in the deployment phase of the project 
we believe the increase in project expenses  including all pay related expenses  related to the business transformation project in fiscal as compared to fiscal will be approximately million to million 
fuel costs increased by million in fiscal over fiscal primarily due to increased contracted and market diesel prices 
our costs per gallon increased in fiscal over fiscal our activities to mitigate fuel costs include reducing miles driven by our trucks through improved routing techniques  improving fleet utilization by adjusting idling time and maximum speeds and using fuel surcharges 
we routinely enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements with a goal of mitigating a portion of the volatility in fuel prices 
our fuel commitments will result in either additional fuel costs or avoided fuel costs based on the comparison of the prices on the fixed price contracts and market prices for the respective periods 
in fiscal  the forward purchase commitments resulted in an estimated million of avoided fuel costs as the fixed price contracts were generally lower than market prices for the contracted volumes 
in fiscal  the forward purchase commitments resulted in an estimated million of avoided fuel costs as the fixed price contracts were generally lower than market prices for the contracted volumes 
as of june   we had forward diesel fuel commitments totaling approximately million through april subsequent to june   we entered into forward diesel fuel commitments totaling approximately million for may and june these contracts will lock in the price of approximately to of our fuel purchase needs for the contracted periods at prices higher than the current market price for diesel 
assuming that fuel prices do not rise significantly over recent levels during fiscal  fuel costs exclusive of any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges  are not expected to fluctuate significantly as compared to fiscal our estimate is based upon current  published quarterly market price projections for diesel  the cost committed to in our forward fuel purchase agreements currently in place for fiscal and estimates of fuel consumption 
actual fuel costs could vary from our estimates if any of these assumptions change  in particular if future fuel prices vary significantly from our current estimates 
we continue to evaluate all opportunities to offset potential increases in fuel expense  including the use of fuel surcharges and overall expense management 
we adjust the carrying values of our coli policies to their cash surrender values on an ongoing basis 
the cash surrender values of these policies are largely based on the values of underlying investments  which through fiscal included publicly traded securities 
as a result  the cash surrender values of these policies fluctuated with changes in the market value of such securities 
the changes in the financial markets resulted in gains for these policies of million in fiscal near the end of fiscal  we reallocated all of our policies into low risk  fixed income securities to reduce earnings volatility and therefore our adjustments for fiscal were not significant 
beginning with fiscal  there should be no significant year over year impact from coli adjustments as compared to fiscal net company sponsored pension costs in fiscal were million lower than in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was due primarily to higher returns on assets of sysco s retirement plan obtained in fiscal at the end of fiscal  sysco decided to freeze future benefit accruals under the retirement plan as of december  for all us based salaried and non union hourly employees 
effective january   these employees will be eligible for additional contributions under an enhanced  defined contribution plan 
net company sponsored pension costs in fiscal have been determined as of the fiscal year end measurement date and will decrease by approximately million in fiscal our expenses related to our defined contribution plan will increase approximately million to million in fiscal the decline in pension cost will occur evenly over fiscal  however  the increased defined contribution expenses will occur in the last half of fiscal when these enhancements go into effect 
over the long term  we believe the changes to both plans will result in reduced volatility of retirement related expenses and a reduction in total retirement related expenses 
absent the retirement plan freeze discussed above  net company sponsored pension costs in fiscal would have increased million instead of decreasing million 
from time to time  we may voluntarily withdraw from multiemployer pension plans to minimize or limit our future exposure to these plans 
in the last two fiscal years  we voluntary withdrew from several multiemployer plans and recorded provisions of million in fiscal and million in fiscal we also measure our expense performance on a cost per case basis  which we seek to align with the gross profit that we are able to generate 
for our broadline companies  our cost per case increased per case as compared to fiscal these increases primarily related to increased payroll costs and fuel costs discussed above 
fiscal vs 
fiscal operating income decreased in fiscal over fiscal to billion  and as a percentage of sales  declined to of sales 
the decrease was driven by the absence of the rd week in fiscal  gross profit dollars growing at a slower rate than sales and operating expenses increasing faster than gross profit partially due to charge of million from withdrawals from multiemployer pension plans 
gross profit dollars increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal  and operating expenses increased in fiscal adjusted operating income increased  or million  in fiscal over fiscal gross profit dollars increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to increased sales  partially offset by the negative comparison of the additional week included in fiscal gross margin was in fiscal  a decline of basis points from the gross margin of in fiscal this decline in gross margin was primarily the result of the following factors described in the paragraphs below 
first  sysco s product cost inflation was estimated as inflation of during fiscal based on our product sales mix for fiscal  we were most impacted by higher levels of inflation in the dairy  meat and seafood product categories in the range of to 
our largest selling product category  canned and dry  experienced inflation of 
second  ongoing strategic pricing initiatives in fiscal lowered our prices to our customers in certain product categories in order to increase sales volumes 
these initiatives are being phased in over time and resulted in short term gross profit declines as a percentage of sales  but we believe will result in long term gross profit dollar growth due to higher sales volumes and increased market share 
we have experienced meaningful year over year volume growth with those items included in the early phases of these programs in the geographies where this program has been implemented 
we believe the long term benefits of these strategic initiatives will result in profitable market share growth 
third  gross profit dollars for fiscal increased as a result of higher fuel surcharges 
fuel surcharges were approximately million higher in fiscal than in the comparable prior year period due to higher fuel prices incurred during fiscal and the application of fuel surcharges to a broader customer base for a small portion of the third quarter and the entire fourth quarter 
operating expenses for fiscal increased primarily due to higher pay related expense  an increase in net company sponsored pension costs  provisions for withdrawal from multiemployer pension plans and higher fuel costs as compared to the prior year period 
the impact of these operating expense increases was partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses of approximately million resulting from the absence of the rd week in fiscal adjusted operating expense increased  or million  in fiscal over fiscal pay related expenses  excluding labor costs associated with our business transformation project  increased by million in fiscal over fiscal the increase was primarily due to increased sales and delivery compensation 
pay related expenses from acquired companies and changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars also contributed to the increase 
partially offsetting these increases were lower provisions for current management incentive bonuses of million 
net company sponsored pension costs in fiscal were million higher than in fiscal the increase in fiscal was due primarily to a decrease in discount rates used to calculate our projected benefit obligation and related pension expense at the end of fiscal  partially offset by reduced amortization of our net actuarial loss resulting from actuarial gains from higher returns on assets of sysco s retirement plan during fiscal from time to time  we may voluntarily withdraw from multiemployer pension plans to minimize or limit our future exposure to these plans 
in fiscal years and  we voluntary withdrew from several multiemployer plans and recorded provisions of million in fiscal and million in fiscal fuel costs increased by million in fiscal over fiscal primarily due to increased contracted and market diesel prices 
our costs per gallon increased in fiscal over fiscal our forward fuel commitments will result in either additional fuel costs or avoided fuel costs based on the comparison of the prices on the fixed price contracts and market prices for the respective periods 
in fiscal  the forward purchase commitments resulted in an estimated million of avoided fuel costs as the fixed price contracts were generally lower than market prices for the contracted volumes 
in fiscal  the forward purchase commitments resulted in an estimated million of additional fuel costs as the fixed price contracts were higher than market prices for the contracted volumes for a portion of the fiscal year 
for our broadline companies  our cost per case increased per case as compared to fiscal these increases primarily related to increased payroll costs  increased fuel costs and charges created by withdrawing from multiemployer plans  all of which are discussed above 
net earnings net earnings for fiscal decreased over the comparable prior year period 
this decrease was primarily due to changes in operating income discussed above 
adjusted net earnings increased during fiscal net earnings for fiscal decreased over the comparable prior year period 
this decrease was primarily due to the absence of the rd week in fiscal  the factors discussed above and an increase in the effective tax rate 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was  compared to an effective tax rate of for fiscal the difference between the tax rates for the two periods resulted largely from the one time reversal of interest accruals for tax contingencies related to our settlement with the internal revenue service irs in the first quarter of fiscal adjusted net earnings increased during fiscal the effective tax rate for fiscal was 
indefinitely reinvested earnings taxed at foreign statutory tax rates less than our domestic tax rate had the impact of reducing the effective tax rate 
the effective tax rate of for fiscal was favorably impacted primarily by two items 
first  we recorded a tax benefit of approximately million for the reversal of valuation allowances previously recorded on state net operating loss carryforwards 
second  we adjust the carrying values of our coli policies to their cash surrender values 
the gain of million recorded in fiscal was primarily non taxable for income tax purposes  and had the impact of decreasing income tax expense for the period by million 
partially offsetting these favorable impacts was the recording of million in tax and interest related to various federal  foreign and state uncertain tax positions 
the effective tax rate of for fiscal was favorably impacted primarily by two items 
first  we recorded an income tax benefit of approximately million resulting from the one time reversal of a previously accrued liability related to the settlement with the irs see note  income taxes for additional discussion 
second  the gain of million recorded to adjust the carrying value of coli policies to their cash surrender values in fiscal was non taxable for income tax purposes  and had the impact of decreasing income tax expense for the period by million 
earnings per share basic and diluted earnings per share in fiscal were and  respectively 
this represents a decrease from the comparable prior year period amount for basic earnings per share of per share and a decrease from the comparable prior year period amount for diluted earnings per share of 
this decrease was primarily the result of the factors discussed above 
adjusted diluted earnings per share was in fiscal and in fiscal  or an increase of 
basic and diluted earnings per share decreased in fiscal from the prior year 
this decrease was primarily the result of the absence of the rd week in fiscal and the factors discussed above  as well as a net reduction in shares outstanding 
the net reduction in both average and diluted shares outstanding was primarily due to share repurchases which occurred during the first weeks of fiscal adjusted diluted earnings per share were in fiscal and in fiscal  or an increase of 
non gaap reconciliations sysco s results of operations are impacted by costs from our multi year business transformation project btp  significant charges from the withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan mepp  restructuring charges and recognized tax benefits 
additionally  near the end of fiscal  we reallocated all of our investments in our coli policies into low risk  fixed income securities and therefore we do not expect significant volatility in operating expenses  operating income  net earnings and diluted earnings per share in future periods related to these policies 
we experienced significant gains in these policies during fiscal management believes that adjusting its operating expenses  operating income  net earnings and diluted earnings per share to remove the impact of the business transformation project expenses  multiemployer pension plan charges  restructuring charges  coli gains and tax benefits provides an important perspective with respect to underlying business trends and results and provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of the performance of the company s underlying operations and facilitates comparison on a year over year basis 
in addition  sysco s fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest to june th 
this resulted in a week year ending june  for fiscal  a week year ending july  for fiscal and a week year ending july  for fiscal because the fourth quarter of fiscal contained an additional week as compared to fiscal  our results of operations for fiscal are not directly comparable to fiscal management believes that adjusting the fiscal results of operations for the estimated impact of the additional week provides more comparable financial results on a year over year basis 
as a result  in the non gaap reconciliation below for fiscal compared to fiscal  in addition to the specific line item impacts noted above  operating items have been adjusted by one fourteenth of the total metric for the fourth quarter of fiscal failure to make these adjustments would cause the year over year changes in certain metrics such as sales  operating income  net earnings and diluted earnings per share to be overstated  whereas in certain cases  a metric may actually have increased rather than declined or declined rather than increased on a more comparable year over year basis 
the company uses these non gaap measures when evaluating its financial results as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes 
these financial measures should not be used as a substitute in assessing the company s results of operations for periods presented 
an analysis of any non gaap financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap

segment results we have aggregated our operating companies into a number of segments  of which only broadline and sygma are reportable segments as defined in accounting provisions related to disclosures about segments of an enterprise 
the accounting policies for the segments are the same as those disclosed by sysco within the financial statements and supplementary data within part ii item of this form k 
intersegment sales represent specialty produce and imported specialty products distributed by the broadline and sygma operating companies 
management evaluates the performance of each of our operating segments based on its respective operating income results 
corporate expenses generally include all expenses of the corporate office and sysco s shared service center 
these also include all share based compensation costs and expenses related to the company s business transformation project 
while a segment s operating income may be impacted in the short term by increases or decreases in gross profits  expenses  or a combination thereof  over the long term each business segment is expected to increase its operating income at a greater rate than sales growth 
this is consistent with our long term goal of leveraging earnings growth at a greater rate than sales growth

broadline operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non food products to both traditional and chain restaurant customers and also provide custom cut meat operations 
broadline operations have significantly higher operating margins than the rest of sysco s operations 
in fiscal  the broadline operating results represented approximately of sysco s overall sales and of the aggregate operating income of sysco s segments  which excludes corporate expenses 
there are several factors which contribute to these higher operating results as compared to the sygma and other operating segments 
we have invested substantial amounts in assets  operating methods  technology and management expertise in this segment 
the breadth of its sales force  geographic reach of its distribution area and its purchasing power allow us to benefit from this segment s earnings 
sales sales for fiscal were greater than fiscal product cost inflation and the resulting increase in selling prices  combined with case volume improvement  contributed to the increase in sales in fiscal changes in product costs  an internal measure of inflation or deflation  were estimated as inflation of in fiscal non comparable acquisitions contributed to the overall sales comparison for fiscal the changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars negatively impacted sales by compared to fiscal sales for fiscal were greater than fiscal negatively affecting the sales comparison of fiscal to fiscal was the additional week in fiscal product cost inflation and the resulting increase in selling prices  combined with case volume improvement  contributed to the increase in sales in fiscal changes in product costs  an internal measure of inflation or deflation  were estimated as inflation of in fiscal non comparable acquisitions contributed to the overall sales comparison for fiscal the changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars positively impacted sales by compared to fiscal operating income operating income increased by in fiscal over fiscal this increase was driven by gross profit dollars increasing more than operating expenses 
gross profit dollars increased in fiscal primarily due to increased sales  however  gross profit dollars increased at a lower rate than sales 
this decline in gross margin was primarily the result of product cost inflation and competitive pressures on pricing 
based on broadline s product sales mix for fiscal  we were most impacted by higher levels of inflation in the meat  canned and dry and frozen product categories 
while we are generally able to pass through modest levels of inflation to our customers  we were unable pass through fully these higher levels of product cost inflation with the same gross margin in these product categories without negatively impacting our customers business and therefore our business 
in the summer months of  certain agricultural areas of the united states have experienced severe drought 
the impact of this drought is uncertain and could result in volatile input costs 
input costs could increase at any point in time for a large portion of the products that we sell for a prolonged period 
while we cannot predict whether inflation will continue at these levels  prolonged periods of high inflation  either overall or in certain product categories  can have a negative impact on our customers  as high food costs can reduce consumer spending in the food away from home market  and may negatively impact the broadline segment s sales  gross profit and earnings 
our product cost reduction initiative is designed to lower our total product costs by million to million annually by fiscal  however we believe the impact on our product costs in fiscal will be modest 
in addition  gross profit dollars for fiscal increased as a result of higher fuel surcharges 
fuel surcharges were approximately million higher in fiscal than the prior year due to the application of fuel surcharges to a broader customer base during fiscal due to higher fuel prices incurred during these periods 
assuming that fuel prices do not greatly vary from recent levels  we expect the level of fuel surcharges in fiscal to remain consistent with those experienced in fiscal operating expenses for the broadline segment increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal the expense increases in fiscal were driven largely by an increase in pay related expenses and fuel costs  partially offset by a favorable comparison in the provisions recorded for the withdrawal from multiemployer pension plans in each fiscal year 
sales compensation includes commissions which are driven by gross profit dollars and case volumes  and delivery compensation includes activity based pay which is driven by case volumes 
since these drivers are variable in nature  increased gross profit dollars and case volumes will increase sales and delivery compensation 
however  the impact of our productivity related initiatives could favorably impact the magnitude of this trend 
fuel costs were million higher in fiscal than the prior year 
assuming that fuel prices do not rise significantly over recent levels during fiscal  fuel costs exclusive of any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges  are not expected to fluctuate significantly as compared to fiscal our estimate is based upon current  published quarterly market price projections for diesel  the cost committed to in our forward fuel purchase agreements currently in place for fiscal and estimates of fuel consumption 
actual fuel costs could vary from our estimates if any of these assumptions change  in particular if future fuel prices vary significantly from our current estimates 
we continue to evaluate all opportunities to offset potential increases in fuel expense  including the use of fuel surcharges and overall expense management 
from time to time  we may voluntarily withdraw from multiemployer pension plans to minimize or limit our future exposure to these plans 
we recorded provisions related to the withdrawal from multiemployer pension plans of million in fiscal and million in fiscal we also measure our expense performance on a cost per case basis  which we seek to align with the gross profit that we are able to generate 
for our broadline companies  our cost per case increased per case as compared to fiscal and per case as compared to fiscal the increases in both periods primarily related to increased fuel costs and payroll costs discussed above 
charges created by withdrawing from multiemployer plans also contributed to the increase in fiscal as compared to fiscal operating income decreased in fiscal over fiscal to billion  and as a percentage of sales  declined to of sales 
gross profit dollars increased slightly below the rate that operating expenses increased  however  operating expenses included a significant unfavorable comparison in the provisions recorded for the withdrawal from multiemployer pension plans in each fiscal year 
gross profit dollars increased in fiscal primarily due to increased sales  however  gross profit dollars increased at a lower rate than sales 
this slower growth in gross profit dollars was primarily the result of two factors 
first  based on broadline s product sales mix for fiscal  it was most impacted by higher levels of inflation in the dairy  meat and seafood product categories in the range of to 
broadline s largest selling product category  canned and dry  experienced inflation of 
second  ongoing strategic pricing initiatives largely lowered our prices to our customers in certain product categories in order to increase sales volumes 
these initiatives are being phased in over time and resulted in short term gross profit declines as a percentage of sales  but we believe will result in long term gross profit dollar growth due to higher sales volumes and increased market share 
we have experienced meaningful year over year volume growth with those items included in the early phases of these programs in the geographies where this program has been implemented 
we believe the long term benefits of these strategic initiatives will result in profitable market share growth 
in addition  gross profit dollars for fiscal increased as a result of higher fuel surcharges 
fuel surcharges were approximately million higher in fiscal than the prior year due to the application of fuel surcharges to a broader customer base for a small portion of the third quarter and the entire fourth quarter due to higher fuel prices incurred during these periods 
the expense increases in fiscal were driven largely by provisions for withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan  an increase in pay related expenses and increased fuel costs 
in fiscal  we recorded provisions of million for withdrawal liabilities from multiemployer pension plans from which union members elected to withdraw  compared to provisions of million in fiscal the increase in pay related expenses was primarily due to increased sales and delivery compensation 
portions of our pay related expense are variable in nature and are expected to increase when sales and gross profit increase 
pay related expenses from acquired companies and changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars also contributed to the increase 
fuel costs were million higher in fiscal than the prior year 
sygma segment sygma operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non food products to certain chain restaurant customer locations 
sygma operations have traditionally had lower operating income as a percentage of sales than sysco s other segments 
this segment of the foodservice industry has generally been characterized by lower overall operating margins as the volume that these customers command allows them to negotiate for reduced margins 
these operations service chain restaurants through contractual agreements that are typically structured on a fee per case delivered basis 
sales sales were greater in fiscal than in fiscal the increase in sales was primarily due to product cost inflation and the resulting increase in selling prices 
sales to new customers also contributed to the increase 
sales were greater in fiscal than in fiscal negatively affecting the sales comparison of fiscal to fiscal was the additional week in fiscal the increase in sales was primarily due to case volume improvement largely attributable to new customers and  to a lesser extent  from an increase in volume from certain existing customers 
one chain restaurant customer the wendy s company accounted for approximately of the sygma segment sales for the fiscal year ended june  sygma maintains multiple regional contracts with varied expiration dates with this customer 
while the loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on sygma  we do not believe that the loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on sysco as a whole 
operating income operating income decreased million in from the prior year due to rising operating expenses 
gross profit dollars increased while operating expenses increased in fiscal from fiscal contributing to the gross profit increase in fiscal were increased sales and an increase of approximately million in the fuel surcharges charged to customers in fiscal from prior year due to higher fuel prices in fiscal the increase in operating expenses for fiscal was largely driven by increased fuel costs 
fuel costs in fiscal were million greater than the prior year 
assuming that fuel prices do not significantly rise above recent levels during fiscal  we expect fuel costs and fuel surcharges for our sygma segment not to fluctuate significantly as compared to fiscal operating income increased million in over the prior year due to increased sales and improved productivity 
gross profit dollars increased while operating expenses increased in fiscal from fiscal contributing to the gross profit increase in fiscal were increased sales and an increase of approximately million in the fuel surcharges charged to customers in fiscal from prior year due to higher fuel prices in fiscal the increase in operating expenses for fiscal was largely driven by increased delivery and warehouse personnel payroll costs resulting from increased sales as well as increased fuel cost 
productivity improvements occurred within our warehouse and delivery functions in fiscal and expense reductions occurred within our administrative functions in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
fuel costs in fiscal were million greater than the prior year 
other segment other financial information is attributable to our other operating segments  including our specialty produce and lodging industry products  a company that distributes specialty imported products and a company that distributes to international customers 
these operating segments are discussed on an aggregate basis as they do not represent reportable segments under segment accounting literature 
on an aggregate basis  our other segment has had a lower operating income as a percentage of sales than sysco s broadline segment 
sysco has acquired the operating companies within these segments in relatively recent years 
these operations generally operate in a niche within the foodservice industry except for our lodging supply company 
each individual operation is also generally smaller in sales and scope than an average broadline operation and each of these operating segments is considerably smaller in sales and overall scope than the broadline segment 
in fiscal  in the aggregate  the other segment represented approximately of sysco s overall sales and of the aggregate operating income of sysco s segments  which excludes corporate expenses 
operating income decreased for fiscal from fiscal the decrease in operating income was caused partially due to increased expenses in our specialty produce segment 
operating income increased for fiscal from fiscal the operating income comparison was negatively affected by the additional week in fiscal the increase in operating income was caused primarily by increased sales in the specialty produce segment and favorable expense management in the specialty produce and lodging industry products segments 
liquidity and capital resources highlights comparisons of the cash flows from fiscal to fiscal cash flows from operations were billion this year compared to billion last year 
settlement payments to the irs were million in both periods 
capital expenditures totaled million this year compared to million last year 
bank borrowings  net were a net repayment of million this year compared to a net borrowing million last year 
treasury stock purchases were million this year compared to million last year 
dividends paid were million this year compared to million last year 
sources and uses of cash sysco s strategic objectives include continuous investment in our business  these investments are funded by a combination of cash from operations and access to capital from financial markets 
our operations historically have produced significant cash flow 
cash generated from operations is generally allocated to working capital requirements  investments in facilities  systems  fleet  other equipment and technology  cash dividends  acquisitions compatible with our overall growth strategy  contributions to our various retirement plans  and debt repayments 
any remaining cash generated from operations may be invested in high quality  short term instruments or applied toward the cost of the share repurchase program 
as a part of our ongoing strategic analysis  we regularly evaluate business opportunities  including potential acquisitions and sales of assets and businesses  and our overall capital structure 
any transactions resulting from these evaluations may materially impact our liquidity  borrowing capacity  leverage ratios and capital availability 
we continue to generate substantial cash flows from operations and remain in a strong financial position  however our liquidity and capital resources can be influenced by economic trends and conditions 
uncertain economic conditions and uneven levels of consumer confidence and the resulting pressure on consumer disposable income have lowered our sales growth and our cash flows from operations 
product cost inflation has lowered our gross profit and cash flows from operations as we were unable to pass through all of the increased product costs with the same gross margin to our customers 
we believe our mechanisms to manage working capital  such as credit monitoring  optimizing inventory levels and maximizing payment terms with vendors  and our mechanisms to manage product cost inflation have been sufficient to limit a significant unfavorable impact on our cash flows from operations 
we believe these mechanisms will continue prevent a significant unfavorable impact on our cash flows from operations 
at june   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  approximately of which was held by our international subsidiaries generated from our earnings of international operations 
if these earnings were transferred among countries or repatriated to the us  such amounts may be subject to additional tax obligations  however  we do not currently anticipate the need to relocate this cash 
we believe the following sources will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months and beyond  while maintaining sufficient liquidity for normal operating purposes our cash flows from operations  the availability of additional capital under our existing commercial paper programs  supported by our revolving credit facility  and bank lines of credit  our ability to access capital from financial markets  including issuances of debt securities  either privately or under our shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission sec 
due to our strong financial position  we believe that we will continue to be able to effectively access the commercial paper market and long term capital markets  if necessary 
we believe our cash flows from operations will improve in fiscal due to benefits from our business transformation project and initiatives to improve our working capital management 
cash flows operating activities fiscal vs 
fiscal we generated billion in cash flow from operations in fiscal  as compared to billion in fiscal the increase of million between fiscal and fiscal was largely attributable to changes in working capital  a year over year reduction in tax payments and the redemption of some of our coli policies 
these increases were partially offset by the year over year impact of multiemployer withdrawal provisions and payments 
these items are more fully described below 
changes in working capital  specifically accounts receivable  inventory and accounts payable  contributed million to the increase in cash flow from operations in fiscal as compared to fiscal both periods were affected by increases in accounts receivable and inventory  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable resulting primarily from inflation driven increases in product cost and sales 
however  fiscal was impacted by these items to a lesser extent due primarily to working capital improvements within accounts receivable and inventory and also less growth in average daily sales in the final month of fiscal as compared to the same period in fiscal tax payments were million less in fiscal than in fiscal the decrease in tax payments was partially due to the company being in a prepaid position at the end of fiscal in certain jurisdictions 
in addition  various movements in taxable temporary differences caused estimated taxable income to be lower in fiscal  requiring less tax payments in fiscal than in fiscal we made our final payments on a previous irs tax settlement of million in fiscal the completion of these settlement payments will have a positive impact on our cash flows in fiscal we received approximately million in cash from the one time redemption during the period of some of our investments in coli policies that we maintained to meet a portion of our obligations under the supplemental executive retirement plan serp 
this resulted in a positive impact to cash flow from operations in fiscal by decreasing other assets by million 
those redeemed coli policies were replaced by less volatile existing corporate owned real estate assets as part of our plan to reduce the market driven coli impact on our earnings 
multiemployer withdrawal provisions and payments had a negative impact of million on the comparison of cash flow from operations in fiscal to fiscal the net impact of withdrawal provisions and payments was a cash outflow of million in fiscal  compared to a million accrual in fiscal fiscal vs 
fiscal we generated billion in cash flow from operations in fiscal  as compared to billion in fiscal the increase of million between fiscal and fiscal was driven largely by a reduction in the amount of payments made in relation to the irs settlement of million and reduced pension contributions in the amount of million in fiscal as compared to fiscal these increases were partially offset by changes in working capital discussed in more detail below 
payments related to the irs settlement were million in fiscal and million in fiscal see further discussion of the irs settlement in note  income taxes to the consolidated financial statements in item our contributions to our company sponsored defined benefit plans were million in fiscal and million in fiscal  respectively 
included in the million of contributions in fiscal was a million contribution to our retirement plan that would normally have been made in fiscal included in the million of contributions in fiscal was a million contribution to our retirement plan that would normally have been made in fiscal and quarterly contributions totaling million for fiscal changes in working capital  specifically accounts receivable  inventory and accounts payable  reduced cash flow from operations by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increases in accounts receivable and inventory balances in fiscal and fiscal were primarily due to sales growth 
an increase in daily sales outstanding also contributed to the increase in accounts receivable and inventory balances in fiscal the increase in accounts payable balances in fiscal and fiscal was primarily from the growth in inventory resulting from sales growth 
investing activities fiscal capital expenditures included replacement or significant expansion of facilities in san diego  california  boston  massachusetts  lincoln  nebraska  syracuse  new york and central texas  construction of fold out facilities in southern california and long island  new york  the continued remodeling of our shared services facility purchased in fiscal  fleet replacements  and investments in technology including our business transformation project 
fiscal capital expenditures included investments in technology including our business transformation project  fleet replacements  replacement or significant expansion of facilities in philadelphia  pennsylvania and central texas  the purchase of land for a fold out facility in southern california  and the remodeling of our shared services facility purchased in fiscal fiscal capital expenditures included investments in technology including our business transformation project  fleet replacements  replacement or significant expansion of facilities in vancouver  british columbia  canada  winnipeg  manitoba  canada  billings  montana  plainfield  new jersey  philadelphia  pennsylvania and houston  texas  the purchase of a facility for our future shared services operations in connection with our business transformation project  and the purchase of land for a fold out facility in long island  new york 
capital expenditures in fiscal increased by million primarily due to a greater number of new facilities and expansion projects underway this year 
capital expenditures in fiscal and for our business transformation project were million and million  respectively 
we expect total capital expenditures in fiscal to be in the range of million to million 
fiscal expenditures will include facility  fleet and other equipment replacements and expansions  new facility construction  including fold out facilities  and investments in technology 
during fiscal  in the aggregate  the company paid cash of million for operations acquired during fiscal and for contingent consideration related to operations acquired in previous fiscal years 
during fiscal  we acquired for cash broadline foodservice operations in sacramento  california  quebec  canada  new haven  connecticut  grand rapids  michigan  minneapolis  minnesota  columbia  south carolina and spokane  washington 
in addition  sysco acquired for cash a company that distributes specialty imported products headquartered in chicago  illinois 
during fiscal  in the aggregate  the company paid cash of million for operations acquired during fiscal and for contingent consideration related to operations acquired in previous fiscal years 
during fiscal  we acquired for cash broadline foodservice operations in central california  los angeles  california  ontario  canada  lincoln  nebraska  and trenton  new jersey 
during fiscal  in the aggregate  the company paid cash of million for operations acquired during fiscal and for contingent consideration related to operations acquired in previous fiscal years 
during fiscal  we acquired for cash a broadline foodservice operation in syracuse  new york  a produce distributor in atlanta  georgia and a seafood distributor in edmonton  alberta  canada 
financing activities equity transactions proceeds from common stock reissued from treasury for share based compensation awards were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in proceeds in fiscal was due to an increase in the number of options exercised in fiscal  as compared to fiscal and the level of option exercises  and thus proceeds  will vary from period to period and is largely dependent on movements in our stock price 
we traditionally have engaged in board approved share repurchase programs 
the number of shares acquired and their cost during the past three fiscal years were  shares for million in fiscal   shares for million in fiscal and  shares for million in fiscal there were  additional shares repurchased through august   resulting in a remaining authorization by our board of directors to repurchase up to  shares  based on the trades made through that date 
our current share repurchase strategy is to purchase enough shares to keep our diluted average shares outstanding relatively constant 
to achieve this goal  we believe we will not have to purchase as many shares in fiscal as were purchased in fiscal we have made dividend payments to our shareholders in each fiscal year since our company inception over years ago 
we target a dividend payout of to of net earnings 
we paid in excess of that range in fiscal primarily due to increased expenses from our business transformation project 
we believe as we realize benefits from this project  our dividend payout will return to this targeted range 
dividends paid were million  or per share  in fiscal  million  or per share  in fiscal and million  or per share  in fiscal in may  we declared our regular quarterly dividend for the first quarter of fiscal of per share  which was paid in july in november  we filed with the sec a shelf registration statement covering  shares of common stock to be offered from time to time in connection with acquisitions 
as of august    shares remained available for issuance under this registration statement 
debt activity and borrowing availability short term borrowings we have uncommitted bank lines of credit  which provided for unsecured borrowings for working capital of up to million  of which none was outstanding as of june  or august  our irish subsidiary  pallas foods limited  has a million euro committed facility for unsecured borrowings for working capital 
there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility as of june  or august  on june   a canadian subsidiary of sysco entered into a short term demand loan facility for the purpose of facilitating a distribution from the canadian subsidiary to sysco  and sysco concurrently entered into an agreement with the bank to guarantee the loan 
the amount borrowed was million and was repaid in full on july  commercial paper and revolving credit facility we have a board approved commercial paper program allowing us to issue short term unsecured notes in an aggregate amount not to exceed billion 
in december  we terminated our previously existing revolving credit facility that supported the company s us and canadian commercial paper programs 
at the same time  sysco and one of its subsidiaries  sysco international  ulc  entered into a new billion credit facility supporting the company s us and canadian commercial paper programs 
this facility provides for borrowings in both us and canadian dollars 
borrowings by sysco international  ulc under the credit agreement are guaranteed by sysco  and borrowings by sysco and sysco international  ulc under the credit agreement and guaranteed by all the wholly owned subsidiaries of sysco that are guarantors of the company s senior notes and debentures 
the facility expires on december   but is subject to extension 
there were no commercial paper issuances outstanding as of june  or august  during fiscal  and  aggregate outstanding commercial paper issuances and short term bank borrowings ranged from approximately zero to million  zero to million  and zero to million  respectively 
during fiscal  and  our aggregate commercial paper issuances and short term bank borrowings had a weighted average interest rate of  and  respectively 
fixed rate debt included in current maturities of long term debt as june  are the senior notes totaling million  which mature in february it is our intention to fund the repayment of these notes at maturity through cash on hand  cash flow from operations  issuances of commercial paper  senior notes or a combination thereof 
in september  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively converted million of fixed rate debt maturing in fiscal to floating rate debt 
in october  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively converted million of fixed rate debt maturing in fiscal to floating rate debt 
both transactions were entered into with the goal of reducing overall borrowing cost and increasing floating interest rate exposure 
these transactions were designated as fair value hedges since the swaps hedge against the changes in fair value of fixed rate debt resulting from changes in interest rates 
in february  we filed with the sec an automatically effective well known seasoned issuer shelf registration statement for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of common stock  preferred stock  debt securities and guarantees of debt securities that may be issued from time to time 
in june  we repaid the senior notes totaling million at maturity utilizing a combination of cash flow from operations and commercial paper issuances 
in may  we entered into an agreement with a notional amount of million to lock in a component of the interest rate on our then forecasted debt offering 
we designated this derivative as a cash flow hedge of the variability in the cash outflows of interest payments on a portion of the then forecasted june debt issuance due to changes in the benchmark interest rate 
in june  in conjunction with the issuance of the million senior notes maturing in fiscal  we settled the treasury lock  locking in the effective yields on the related debt 
upon settlement  we received cash of million  which represented the fair value of the swap agreement at the time of settlement 
this amount is being amortized as an offset to interest expense over the year term of the debt  and the unamortized balance is reflected as a gain  net of tax  accumulated other comprehensive loss 
in june  we issued senior notes totaling million due june  the notes and senior notes totaling million due june  the notes under its february shelf registration 
the and notes  which were priced at and of par  respectively  are unsecured  are not subject to any sinking fund requirement and include a redemption provision which allows sysco to retire the notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par plus accrued interest or an amount designed to ensure that the note holders are not penalized by early redemption 
proceeds from the notes will be utilized over a period of time for general corporate purposes  which may include acquisitions  refinancing of debt  working capital  share repurchases and capital expenditures 
total debt total debt as of june  was billion of which approximately was at fixed rates with a weighted average of and an average life of years  and the remainder was at floating rates with a weighted average of and an average life of one year 
certain loan agreements contain typical debt covenants to protect note holders  including provisions to maintain the company s long term debt to total capital ratio below a specified level 
we are currently in compliance with all debt covenants 
other as part of normal business activities  we issue letters of credit through major banking institutions as required by certain vendor and insurance agreements 
in addition  in connection with our audits in certain tax jurisdictions  we have posted of letters of credit in order to proceed to the appeals process 
as of june  and july   letters of credit outstanding were million and million  respectively 
other considerations multiemployer pension plans as discussed in note  multiemployer employee benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements in item  we contribute to several multiemployer defined benefit pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements covering union represented employees 
under certain circumstances  including our voluntary withdrawal or a mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from certain underfunded plans  we would be required to make payments to the plans for our proportionate share of the multiemployer plan s unfunded vested liabilities 
we believe that one of the above mentioned events is reasonably possible with certain plans in which we participate and estimate our share of withdrawal liability for these plans could have been as much as million as of june  and august  this estimate excludes plans for which we have recorded withdrawal liabilities or where the likelihood of the above mentioned events is deemed remote 
due to the lack of current information  we believe our current share of the withdrawal liability could materially differ from this estimate 
required contributions to multiemployer plans could increase in the future as these plans strive to improve their funding levels 
in addition  pension related legislation in the united states requires underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of their underfunding 
we believe that any unforeseen requirements to pay such increased contributions  withdrawal liability and excise taxes would be funded through cash flow from operations  borrowing capacity or a combination of these items 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth  as of june   certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make contractual future payments payments due by period more than total year years years years in thousands recorded contractual obligations long term debt capital lease obligations deferred compensation serp and other postretirement plans multiemployer pension plans unrecognized tax benefits and interest unrecorded contractual obligations interest payments related to debt retirement plan long term non capitalized leases purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations the estimate of the timing of future payments under the executive deferred compensation plan involves the use of certain assumptions  including retirement ages and payout periods 
includes estimated contributions to the unfunded serp and other postretirement benefit plans made in amounts needed to fund benefit payments for vested participants in these plans through fiscal  based on actuarial assumptions 
represents voluntary withdrawal liabilities recorded and excludes normal contributions required under our collective bargaining agreements 
unrecognized tax benefits relate to uncertain tax positions recorded under accounting standards related to uncertain tax positions 
as of june   we had a liability of million for unrecognized tax benefits for all tax jurisdictions and million for related interest that could result in cash payment 
we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of non current payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time 
accordingly  the related non current balances have not been reflected in the payments due by period section of the table 
includes payments on floating rate debt based on rates as of june   assuming amount remains unchanged until maturity  and payments on fixed rate debt based on maturity dates 
the impact of our outstanding fixed to floating interest rate swaps on the fixed rate debt interest payments is included as well based on the floating rates in effect as of june  provides the estimated minimum contribution to the retirement plan through fiscal to meet erisa minimum funding requirements under the assumption that we only make minimum funding requirement contributions each year  based on actuarial assumptions 
for purposes of this table  purchase obligations include agreements for purchases of product in the normal course of business  for which all significant terms have been confirmed  including minimum quantities resulting from our sourcing initiative 
such amounts included in the table above are based on estimates 
purchase obligations also includes amounts committed with a third party to provide hardware and hardware hosting services over a ten year period ending in fiscal see discussion under note  commitments and contingencies  to the notes to consolidated financial statements in item  fixed electricity agreements and fixed fuel purchase commitments 
purchase obligations exclude full requirements electricity contracts where no stated minimum purchase volume is required 
certain acquisitions involve contingent consideration  typically payable only in the event that certain operating results are attained or certain outstanding contingencies are resolved 
aggregate contingent consideration amounts outstanding as of june  included million 
this amount is not included in the table above 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses in the accompanying financial statements 
significant accounting policies employed by sysco are presented in the notes to the financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
these policies require our most subjective or complex judgments  often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we have reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates and this related disclosure 
our most critical accounting policies and estimates pertain to the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  self insurance programs  company sponsored pension plans  income taxes  vendor consideration  goodwill and intangible assets and share based compensation 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable and determine the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors 
we utilize specific criteria to determine uncollectible receivables to be written off  including whether a customer has filed for or has been placed in bankruptcy  has had accounts referred to outside parties for collection or has had accounts past due over specified periods 
allowances are recorded for all other receivables based on analysis of historical trends of write offs and recoveries 
in addition  in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation  a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded to reduce the receivable to the net amount reasonably expected to be collected 
our judgment is required as to the impact of certain of these items and other factors as to ultimate realization of our accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
self insurance program we maintain a self insurance program covering portions of workers compensation  general liability and vehicle liability costs 
the amounts in excess of the self insured levels are fully insured by third party insurers 
we also maintain a fully self insured group medical program 
liabilities associated with these risks are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience  medical cost trends  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
projections of future loss expenses are inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claims occurrences and could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 
in an attempt to mitigate the risks of workers compensation  vehicle and general liability claims  safety procedures and awareness programs have been implemented 
company sponsored pension plans amounts related to defined benefit plans recognized in the financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis 
three of the more critical assumptions in the actuarial calculations are the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits  the assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation levels and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
for guidance in determining the discount rates  we calculate the implied rate of return on a hypothetical portfolio of high quality fixed income investments for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximates the estimated payouts of the pension plan 
the discount rate assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate 
the discount rate for determining fiscal net pension costs for the retirement plan  which was determined as of the july  measurement date  decreased basis points to 
the discount rate for determining fiscal net pension costs for the serp  which was determined as of the july  measurement date  decreased basis points to 
the combined effect of these discount rate changes increased our net company sponsored pension costs for all plans for fiscal by an estimated million 
the discount rate for determining fiscal net pension costs for the retirement plan  which was determined as of the june  measurement date  decreased basis points to 
the discount rate for determining fiscal net pension costs for the serp  which was determined as of the june  measurement date  decreased basis points to 
the combined effect of these discount rate changes will increase our net company sponsored pension costs for all plans for fiscal by an estimated million 
a basis point increase in the discount rates for fiscal would decrease sysco s net company sponsored pension cost by million  while a basis point decrease in the discount rates would increase pension cost by million 
the impact of a basis point increase in the discount rates differs from the impact of a basis point decrease in discount rates because the liabilities are less sensitive to change at higher discount rates 
therefore  a basis point increase in the discount rate will not generate the same magnitude of change as a basis point decrease in the discount rate 
we look to actual plan experience in determining the rates of increase in compensation levels 
we used a plan specific age related set of rates for the retirement plan  which are equivalent to a single rate of as of june  and july  for determining the benefit obligations as of june  and july   the serp calculations use an age graded salary growth assumption 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets of the retirement plan was for fiscal and for fiscal the expectations of future returns are derived from a mathematical asset model that incorporates assumptions as to the various asset class returns  reflecting a combination of historical performance analysis and the forward looking views of the financial markets regarding the yield on bonds  historical returns of the major stock markets and returns on alternative investments 
although not determinative of future returns  the effective annual rate of return on plan assets  developed using geometric compound averaging  was approximately    and  over the year  year  year and year periods ended december   respectively 
in addition  in eight of the last years  the actual return on plan assets has exceeded 
the rate of return assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate 
the expected return on plan assets impacts the recorded amount of net pension costs 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets of the retirement plan is for fiscal a basis point increase decrease in the assumed rate of return for fiscal would decrease increase sysco s net company sponsored pension costs for fiscal by approximately million 
pension accounting standards require the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans in the statement of financial position  with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax 
the amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans as of june  was a charge  net of tax  of million 
the amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans as of july  was a charge  net of tax  of million 
changes in the assumptions  including changes to the discount rate discussed above  together with the normal growth of the plans  the impact of actuarial losses from prior periods  the impact of plan amendments and the timing and amount of contributions decreased net company sponsored pension costs by million in fiscal at the end of fiscal  sysco decided to freeze future benefit accruals under the retirement plan as of december  for all us based salaried and non union hourly employees 
effective january   these employees will be eligible for additional contributions under an enhanced  defined contribution plan 
changes in the assumptions  including changes to the discount rate discussed above  together with the plan freeze  the impact of actuarial losses from prior periods  the impact of plan amendments and the timing and amount of contributions are expected to decrease net company sponsored pension costs in fiscal by approximately million 
absent the retirement plan freeze discussed above  net company sponsored pension costs in fiscal would have increased million instead of decreasing million 
we made cash contributions to our company sponsored pension plans of million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the million contribution to the retirement plan in fiscal exceeded the minimum required contribution for the calendar plan year to meet erisa minimum funding requirements 
the million contribution to the retirement plan in fiscal was voluntary  as there was no minimum required contribution for the calendar plan year 
there are no required contributions to the retirement plan to meet erisa minimum funding requirements in fiscal the estimated fiscal contributions to fund benefit payments for the serp plan are approximately million 
income taxes the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment  the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws 
our provision for income taxes primarily reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various us federal and state  as well as foreign jurisdictions 
jurisdictional tax law changes  increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items  accruals or adjustments of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances  and our change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate 
our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions 
we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable  however  actual results could differ  and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established  or pay amounts in excess of recorded liabilities  our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected 
an unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement may be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 
vendor consideration we recognize consideration received from vendors when the services performed in connection with the monies received are completed and when the related product has been sold by sysco 
there are several types of cash consideration received from vendors 
in many instances  the vendor consideration is in the form of a specified amount per case or per pound 
in these instances  we will recognize the vendor consideration as a reduction of cost of sales when the product is sold 
in some instances  vendor consideration is received upon receipt of inventory in our distribution facilities 
we estimate the amount needed to reduce our inventory based on inventory turns until the product is sold 
our inventory turnover is usually less than one month  therefore  amounts deferred against inventory do not require long term estimation 
in the situations where the vendor consideration is not related directly to specific product purchases  we will recognize these as a reduction of cost of sales when the earnings process is complete  the related service is performed and the amounts realized 
historically  adjustments to our estimates related to vendor consideration have not been significant 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets represent the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of tangible net assets acquired 
certain assumptions and estimates are employed in determining the fair value of assets acquired  including goodwill and other intangible assets  as well as determining the allocation of goodwill to the appropriate reporting unit 
in addition  annually in our fourth quarter or more frequently as needed  we assess the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles by determining whether the fair values of the applicable reporting units exceed the carrying values of these assets 
the reporting units used in assessing goodwill impairment are our nine operating segments as described in note  business segment information  to the consolidated financial statements in item the components within each of our nine operating segments have similar economic characteristics and therefore are aggregated into nine reporting units 
we arrive at our estimates of fair value using a combination of discounted cash flow and earnings multiple models 
the results from each of these models are then weighted and combined into a single estimate of fair value for each of our nine operating segments 
we use a weighting for our discounted cash flow valuation and for the earnings multiple models giving greater emphasis to our discounted cash flow model because the forecasted operating results that serve as a basis for the analysis incorporate management s outlook and anticipated changes for the businesses 
the primary assumptions used in these various models include estimated earnings multiples of comparable acquisitions in the industry including control premiums  earnings multiples on acquisitions completed by sysco in the past  future cash flow estimates of the reporting units  which are dependent on internal forecasts and projected growth rates  and weighted average cost of capital  along with working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
when possible  we use observable market inputs in our models to arrive at the fair values of our reporting units 
we update our projections used in our discounted cash flow model based on historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units 
our estimates of fair value contain uncertainties requiring management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies 
actual results could differ from these assumptions and projections  resulting in the company revising its assumptions and  if required  recognizing an impairment loss 
there were no impairments of goodwill or indefinite lived intangibles recorded as a result of assessment in fiscal  and our past estimates of fair value for fiscal and have not been materially different when revised to include subsequent years actual results 
sysco has not made any material changes in its impairment assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe the estimates used in the analysis are reasonably likely to change materially in the future but we will continue to assess the estimates in the future based on the expectations of the reporting units 
in the fiscal analysis our estimates of fair value did not require additional analysis  however  we would have performed additional analysis to determine if an impairment existed for the following reporting units if our estimates of fair value were decreased by the following amounts 
first  our european broadline company would have required additional analysis if the estimated fair value had been lower 
second  our specialty produce operations would have required additional analysis if the estimated fair value had been lower 
at june   these two reporting units had goodwill aggregating million 
for the remainder of our reporting units which at june  had goodwill aggregating billion  we would have performed additional analysis to determine if an impairment existed for a reporting unit if the estimated fair value for any of these reporting units had declined by greater than 
certain reporting units european broadline  specialty produce  custom cut meat  lodging industry products  imported specialty products and international distribution operations have a greater proportion of goodwill recorded to estimated fair value as compared to the united states broadline  canadian broadline or sygma reporting units 
this is primarily due to these businesses having been recently acquired  and as a result there has been less history of organic growth than in the united states broadline  canadian broadline and sygma reporting units 
in addition  these businesses also have lower levels of cash flow than the united states broadline reporting units 
as such  these reporting units have a greater risk of future impairment if their operations were to suffer a significant downturn 
share based compensation we provide compensation benefits to employees and non employee directors under several share based payment arrangements including various employee stock incentive plans  the employees stock purchase plan  the management incentive plan and various non employee director plans 
as of june   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to share based compensation arrangements 
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility of sysco s stock  implied volatilities from traded options on sysco s stock and other factors 
we utilize historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation model  separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes 
expected dividend yield is estimated based on the historical pattern of dividends and the average stock price for the year preceding the option grant 
the risk free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
the fair value of each restricted stock unit award granted with a dividend equivalent is based on the company s stock price as of the date of grant 
for restricted stock units granted without dividend equivalents  the fair value is reduced by the present value of expected dividends during the vesting period 
the fair value of the stock issued under the employee stock purchase plan is calculated as the difference between the stock price and the employee purchase price 
the fair value of restricted stock granted to employees is based on the stock price on grant date 
the application of a discount to the fair value of a restricted stock grant is dependent upon whether or not each individual grant contains a post vesting restriction 
the compensation cost related to these share based awards is recognized over the requisite service period 
the requisite service period is generally the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
the compensation cost related to stock issuances resulting from employee purchases of stock under the employees stock purchase plan is recognized during the quarter in which the employee payroll withholdings are made 
our share based awards are generally subject to graded vesting over a service period 
we will recognize compensation cost on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 
in addition  certain of our share based awards provide that the awards continue to vest as if the award holder continued to be an employee or director if the award holder meets certain age and years of service thresholds upon retirement 
in these cases  we will recognize compensation cost for such awards over the period from the grant date to the date the employee or director first becomes eligible to retire with the options continuing to vest after retirement 
our option grants include options that qualify as incentive stock options for income tax purposes 
in the period the compensation cost related to incentive stock options is recorded  a corresponding tax benefit is not recorded as it is assumed that we will not receive a tax deduction related to such incentive stock options 
we may be eligible for tax deductions in subsequent periods to the extent that there is a disqualifying disposition of the incentive stock option 
in such cases  we would record a tax benefit related to the tax deduction in an amount not to exceed the corresponding cumulative compensation cost recorded in the financial statements on the particular options multiplied by the statutory tax rate 
forward looking statements certain statements made herein that look forward in time or express management s expectations or beliefs with respect to the occurrence of future events are forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of they include statements about sysco s ability to increase its sales and market share and grow earnings  the continuing impact of economic conditions on consumer confidence and our business  sales and expense trends  including expectations regarding pay related expense defined contribution plan costs and pension costs  anticipated multiemployer pension related liabilities and contributions to various multiemployer pension plans  expectations regarding potential payments of unrecognized tax benefits and interest  expectations regarding share repurchases  dividend payments  expected trends in fuel pricing  usage costs and surcharges  our expectation regarding the provision for losses on accounts receivable  expected implementation  costs and benefits of the erp system  estimated expenses and capital expenditures related to our business transformation project in fiscal  beliefs regarding future erp conversions at our operating companies  expectations regarding our other business transformation initiatives including cost transformation and product cost reduction initiatives  beliefs regarding the timeline for the realization of benefits from each of our initiatives within our business transformation project  our plan to continue to explore and identify opportunities to grow in international markets and adjacent areas that complement our core business  the impact of ongoing legal proceedings  the loss of sygma s largest customer not having a material adverse effect on sysco as a whole  compliance with laws and government regulations not having a material effect on our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position  anticipated acquisitions and capital expenditures and the sources of financing for them  continued competitive advantages and positive results from strategic initiatives  anticipated company sponsored pension plan liabilities  our expectations regarding cash flow from operations  our intentions regarding the repayment of debt  the impact of initiatives to improve working capital  the availability and adequacy of insurance to cover liabilities  predictions regarding the impact of changes in estimates used in impairment analyses  expectations regarding the cost of hardware and hardware hosting services  the anticipated impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and sysco s ability to meet future cash requirements and remain profitable 
these statements are based on management s current expectations and estimates  actual results may differ materially due in part to the risk factors discussed at item a in the annual report on form k and elsewhere 
in addition  the success of sysco s strategic initiatives could be affected by conditions in the economy and the industry and internal factors such as the ability to control expenses  including fuel costs 
expected trends related to fuel costs and usage are impacted by fluctuations in the economy generally and numerous factors affecting the oil industry that are beyond our control 
our efforts to lower our cost of goods sold may be impacted by factors beyond our control  including actions by our competitors and or customers 
we have experienced delays in the implementation of our business transformation project and the expected costs of our business transformation project may be greater or less than currently expected  as we may encounter the need for changes in design or revisions of the project calendar and budget 
our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we experience operating problems  scheduling delays  cost overages  or limitations on the extent of the business transformation during the erp implementation process 
as implementation of the erp system and other initiatives within the business transformation project begins  there may be changes in design or timing that impact near term expense and cause us to revise the project calendar and budget  and additional hiring and training of employees and consultants may be required  which could also impact project expense and timing 
our business transformation project initiatives related to erp implementation  cost transformation and produce cost reduction may not provide the expected benefits or cost savings in a timely fashion  if at all 
if we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from our cost cutting efforts  we could become cost disadvantaged in the marketplace  and our competitiveness and our profitability could decrease 
defined contribution plan costs are impacted by the number of employees participating in the plan and the level of contributions made by each employee 
company sponsored pension plan liabilities are impacted by a number of factors including the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits  the assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation levels and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
the amount of shares repurchased in a given period is subject to a number of factors  including available cash and our general working capital needs at the time 
meeting our dividend target objectives depends on our level of earnings 
our plans with respect to growth in international markets and adjacent areas that complement our core business are subject to the company s other strategic initiatives and plans and economic conditions generally 
legal proceedings are impacted by events  circumstances and individuals beyond the control of sysco 
the need for additional borrowing or other capital is impacted by factors that include capital expenditures or acquisitions in excess of those currently anticipated  stock repurchases at historical levels  or other unexpected cash requirements 
plans regarding the repayment of debt are subject to change at any time based on management s assessment of the overall needs of the company 
the anticipated impact of compliance with laws and regulations also involves the risk that estimates may turn out to be materially incorrect  and laws and regulations  as well as methods of enforcement  are subject to change 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes 
our use of debt directly exposes us to interest rate risk 
floating rate debt  where the interest rate fluctuates periodically  exposes us to short term changes in market interest rates 
fixed rate debt  where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the instrument  exposes us to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at higher rates 
we manage our debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates and may employ interest rate swaps as a tool to achieve that position 
the major risks from interest rate derivatives include changes in the interest rates affecting the fair value of such instruments  potential increases in interest expense due to market increases in floating interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties in such transactions 
fiscal as of june   we had no commercial paper outstanding 
total debt as of june  was billion  of which approximately was at fixed rates of interest  including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements 
in may  we entered into an agreement with a notional amount of million to lock in a component of the interest rate on our then forecasted debt offering 
we designated this derivative as a cash flow hedge of the variability in the cash outflows of interest payments on a portion of the june forecasted debt issuance due to changes in the benchmark interest rate 
in june  in conjunction with the issuance of the million senior notes maturing in fiscal  we settled the treasury lock  locking in the effective yields on the related debt 
in fiscal  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted million of fixed rate debt maturing in fiscal the fiscal swap and million of fixed rate debt maturing in fiscal the fiscal swap to floating rate debt 
both transactions were entered into with the goal of reducing overall borrowing cost 
these transactions were designated as fair value hedges since the swaps hedge against the changes in fair value of fixed rate debt resulting from changes in interest rates 
as of june   the fiscal swap was recognized as an asset within the consolidated balance sheet at fair value within prepaid expenses and other current assets of million 
the fixed interest rate on the hedged debt is and the floating interest rate on the swap is three month libor which resets quarterly 
as of june   the fiscal swap was recognized as an asset within the consolidated balance sheet at fair value within other assets of million 
the fixed interest rate on the hedged debt is and the floating interest rate on the swap is three month libor which resets quarterly

interest rate position as of july  notional amount by expected maturity average interest swap rate thereafter total fair value in thousands interest rate swaps related to debt pay variable receive fixed average variable rate paid rate a plus fixed rate received rate a three month libor foreign currency exchange rate risk the majority of our foreign subsidiaries use their local currency as their functional currency 
to the extent that business transactions are not denominated in a foreign subsidiary s functional currency  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we will also incur gains and losses within our shareholders equity due to the translation of our financial statements from foreign currencies into us dollars 
our income statement trends may be impacted by the translation of the income statements of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars 
the changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars did not have a significant impact on sales when compared to fiscal and positively impacted sales by in fiscal compared to fiscal the impact to our operating income  net earnings and earnings per share was not material in fiscal and fiscal a unfavorable change in the fiscal weighted year to date exchange rate and the resulting impact on our financial statements would have negatively impacted fiscal sales by and would not have materially impacted our operating income  net earnings and earnings per share 
we do not routinely enter into material agreements to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risks 
fuel price risk due to the nature of our distribution business  we are exposed to potential volatility in fuel prices 
the price and availability of diesel fuel fluctuates due to changes in production  seasonality and other market factors generally outside of our control 
increased fuel costs may have a negative impact on our results of operations in three areas 
first  the high cost of fuel can negatively impact consumer confidence and discretionary spending and thus reduce the frequency and amount spent by consumers for food away from home purchases 
second  the high cost of fuel can increase the price we pay for product purchases and we may not be able to pass these costs fully to our customers 
third  increased fuel costs impact the costs we incur to deliver product to our customers 
during fiscal  and  fuel costs related to outbound deliveries represented approximately  and of sales  respectively 
fuel costs  excluding any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges  incurred by sysco increased by approximately million in fiscal from fiscal and by million in fiscal over fiscal we routinely enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements 
as of june   we had forward diesel fuel commitments totaling approximately million through april subsequent to june   we entered into forward diesel fuel commitments totaling approximately million for may and june these contracts will lock in the price of approximately to of our fuel purchase needs for the contracted periods at prices higher than the current market price for diesel 
assuming that fuel prices do not rise significantly over recent levels during fiscal  fuel costs exclusive of any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges  are not expected to fluctuate significantly as compared to fiscal our estimate is based upon current  published quarterly market price projections for diesel  the cost committed to in our forward fuel purchase agreements currently in place for fiscal and estimates of fuel consumption 
actual fuel costs could vary from our estimates if any of these assumptions change  in particular if future fuel prices vary significantly from our current estimates 
a unfavorable change in diesel prices from the market price used in our estimates above would result in a potential increase to million to million 
investment risk our company sponsored qualified pension plan retirement plan holds investments in both equity and fixed income securities 
the amount of our annual contribution to the plan is dependent upon  among other things  the return on the plan s assets and discount rates used to calculate the plan s liability 
fluctuations in asset values can cause the amount of our anticipated future contributions to the plan to increase and pension expense to increase and can result in a reduction to shareholders equity on our balance sheet as of fiscal year end  which is when this plan s funded status is measured 
also  the projected liability of the plan will be impacted by the fluctuations of interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets 
specifically  decreases in these interest rates may have a material impact on our results of operations 
to the extent the financial markets experience declines  our anticipated future contributions  pension expense and funded status will be affected for future years 
a unfavorable change in the value of the investments held by our company sponsored retirement plan at the plan s fiscal year end december  would not have a material impact on our anticipated future contributions for fiscal  however  this unfavorable change would increase our pension expense for fiscal by million and would reduce our shareholders equity on our balance sheet as of june  by million
