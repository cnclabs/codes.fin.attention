our fiscal year ends on the sunday closest to october we refer to our fiscal years by the calendar year in which they end 
for example  the fiscal year ended october  is referred to as fiscal year 

table of contents item business overview we are a leading designer  developer and global supplier of a broad range of analog semiconductor devices with a focus on iii v based products 
iii v semiconductor materials have higher electrical conductivity and thus tend to have better performance characteristics in radio frequency  or rf  and optoelectronic applications than silicon 
we differentiate ourselves through our high performance design and integration capabilities 
we serve three primary target markets  with our wireless communications  wired infrastructure and industrial and automotive electronics target markets accounting for the substantial majority of our revenues 
our product portfolio is extensive and includes thousands of products 
applications for our products in these target markets include cellular phones  consumer appliances  data networking and telecommunications equipment  enterprise storage and servers  factory automation and displays 
until recently  we also sold products into the consumer and computing peripherals target market  which has historically represented a small portion of our total net revenue 
however  as this became a mature and non strategic market for us  during fiscal year we transitioned from developing  manufacturing and selling products into this target market to selling or licensing our intellectual property relevant to this target market  thereby generating royalty revenue instead of product sales revenue 
we completed this transition in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended october  or fiscal year we have a year history of innovation  dating back to our origins within hewlett packard company 
over the years  we have assembled a large team of analog design engineers  and we maintain design and product development engineering resources around the world 
our locations include two design centers in the united states  five in asia and four in europe 
we have developed an extensive portfolio of intellectual property that currently includes over  us and foreign patents and patent applications 
our history and market position enable us to strategically focus our research and development resources to address attractive target markets 
we leverage our significant intellectual property portfolio to integrate multiple technologies and create component solutions that target growth opportunities 
we design products that deliver high performance and provide mission critical functionality 
in particular  we were among the first to deliver commercial film bulk acoustic resonator  or fbar  filters which offer technological advantages over competing filters for smartphones to function more efficiently in today s congested rf spectrum 
fbar technology has historically maintained a significant market share within code division multiple access  or cdma  and g w cdma markets 
as cellular carriers move to the g long term evolution  or lte standard worldwide  we believe these advantages will continue to facilitate rapid adoption of fbar technology throughout the mobile phone ecosystems 
in optical solutions  we were a pioneer in commercializing vertical cavity surface emitting laser  or vcsel 
our fiber optic products and our vcsel based products  including high bandwidth parallel optic transceivers and modules  have been widely adopted throughout the wired infrastructure and computing industries 
in optoelectronics  we are a market leader in submarkets such as optocouplers and optical encoders 
we have a diversified and well established customer base of over  end customers  located throughout the world  which we serve through our multi channel sales and fulfillment system 
however  original equipment manufacturers  or oems  and distributors typically account for the substantial majority of our sales

many of our major customer relationships have been in place multiple years and we have supplied multiple products during that time period 
our close customer relationships have often been built as a result of years of collaborative product development which has enabled us to build our intellectual property portfolio and develop critical expertise regarding our customer s requirements  including substantial system level knowledge 
this collaboration has provided us with key insights into our customers and has enabled us to be more efficient and productive and to better serve our target markets and customers 
we distribute most of our products through our broad distribution network  and a significant portion of our sales are to two of the largest global electronic components distributors  avnet  inc and arrow electronics  inc we also have a direct sales force focused on supporting large oems 
we focus on maintaining an efficient global supply chain and a variable  low cost operating model 
accordingly  we have outsourced a majority of our manufacturing operations utilizing third party foundry and assembly and test capabilities  as well as most of our corporate infrastructure functions 
we aim to minimize capital expenditures by focusing our internal manufacturing capacity on products utilizing our innovative materials and processes to protect our intellectual property and to develop the technology for manufacturing  while outsourcing standard complementary metal oxide semiconductor  or cmos  processes 
we also have over years of operating history in asia  where approximately of our employees are located and where we produce and source the majority of our products 
our presence in asia places us in close proximity to many of our customers manufacturing facilities and at the center of worldwide electronics manufacturing 
markets and products we focus on leveraging our design capabilities to develop products for target markets where we believe our innovation and reputation will allow us to earn attractive margins 
in each of our target markets  we have multiple product families that 
table of contents primarily provide oems with component or subsystem products 
our product portfolio ranges from simple discrete devices to complex sub systems that include multiple device types and incorporate firmware for interface between digital systems 
in some cases  our products include mechanical hardware that interfaces with optoelectronic or capacitive sensors 
we intend to expand our product offerings to address existing and adjacent market opportunities  and plan to selectively target attractive segments within large established markets 
we target markets that require high quality and the integrated performance characteristics of our products 
for the fiscal year ended october   wireless communications contributed  wired infrastructure contributed and industrial and automotive electronics contributed of our net revenue  respectively

until august  we also manufactured products for the consumer and computing peripherals target market  including motion control encoders that control the paper feed and print head movement in printers and other office automation products and image sensors for optical mouse applications  using leds and cmos image sensors to create a subsystem that can detect motion over an arbitrary desktop surface 
during fiscal year  we transitioned from manufacturing and selling these products to selling or licensing our intellectual property relevant to this target market  thereby generating royalty revenue instead of product sales 
consumer and computing peripherals contributed to our net revenue for the fiscal year ended october  research and development we are committed to continuous investment in product development  with a focus on rapidly introducing new  proprietary products 
many of our products have grown out of our own research and development efforts  and have given us competitive advantages in certain target markets due to performance differentiation 
we focus our research and development efforts on the development of innovative  sustainable and higher value product platforms 
we leverage our design capabilities in markets where we believe our innovation and reputation will allow us to earn attractive margins by developing high value add products 
we intend to continue to build on our history of innovation  and our intellectual property portfolio  design expertise and system level knowledge  to create more integrated solutions 
we plan to continue investing in product development to drive growth in our business 
we also invest in process development and maintain fabrication capabilities in order to optimize processes for devices that are manufactured internally 
our field application engineers  or faes  and design engineers are located near many of our customers around the world  enabling us to support our customers in each stage of their product development cycle  from early stages of production design through volume manufacturing and future growth 
by collaborating with our customers  we have opportunities to develop high value added  customized products for them that leverage our existing technologies 
research and development expenses were million  million and million for the years ended october   october  and october   respectively 
we anticipate that we will continue to make significant research and development expenditures in order to maintain our competitive position with a continuous flow of innovative and sustainable product platforms 
as of october   we had approximately  employees dedicated to research and development at multiple locations around the world 

table of contents customers  sales  marketing and distribution a relatively small number of customers account for a significant portion of our net revenue 
in the year ended october   foxconn technology group accounted for of our net revenue  and our top customers  which included three distributors  collectively accounted for of our net revenue 
however  we believe that aggregate sales of our products to certain of our customers exceeds the amount of our direct sales to them 
for example  we believe our aggregate sales to two oems  when direct sales are combined with indirect sales to them through the respective contract manufacturers that they utilize  each accounted for more than of our net revenues  for fiscal year we expect to continue to experience significant customer concentration in future periods 
the loss of  or significant decrease in demand from  any of our top ten customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operation and financial condition 
we sell our products through a network of distributors and our direct sales force globally 
our customers require timely delivery often to multiple locations around the world 
we have strategically developed distributor relationships to serve tens of thousands of customers 
our direct sales force is focused on supporting our large oem customers 
additionally  our extensive network of faes enhances our customer reach and our visibility into new product opportunities 
we also complement our direct sales force with a network of manufacturing sales representative companies to cover particular geographies and customers in emerging markets 
our main global distributors are avnet  inc  and arrow electronics  inc  complemented by a number of specialty regional distributors with customer relationships based on their respective product ranges 
as of october   our sales and marketing organization consisted of approximately employees  many of whom have responsibility for emerging accounts  for large  global accounts  or for our distributors 
our sales force has specialized product and service knowledge that enables us to sell specific offerings at key levels throughout a customer s organization 
as part of our global reach  we have a number of sales offices located in various countries  with a significant presence in asia  which is a key center of the worldwide electronics supply chain 
many of our customers design products in north america or europe that are then manufactured in asia 
we maintain dedicated regional customer support call centers  where we address customer issues and handle logistics and other order fulfillment requirements 
we are well positioned to support our customers throughout the design  technology transfer and manufacturing stages across all geographies 
operations a majority of our manufacturing operations are outsourced and we utilize external foundries to fabricate our semiconductors  including taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd  or tsmc and win semiconductors corp 
for certain of our product families  substantially all of our revenue is derived from semiconductors fabricated by external foundries  including our high speed serdes ics  leds  and led based displays 
we also use third party contract manufacturers for a significant majority of our assembly and test operations  including amertron incorporated  ase korea inc  and the hana microelectronics public company ltd 
group of companies  or hana 
in some instances we may only qualify one contract manufacturer to manufacture certain of our products 
for example  until recently  hana was the only manufacturer of certain of sensors for our industrial market and certain multi market transistor products 
we maintain our internal fabrication facilities for products utilizing our innovative materials and processes to protect our intellectual property and to develop the technology for manufacturing  and we outsource standard cmos processes 
examples of internally fabricated semiconductors include fbar filters for wireless communications and vcsel based lasers for fiber optic communications 
the majority of our internal iii v semiconductor wafer fabrication is done in the united states and singapore 
as of october   approximately  manufacturing employees were devoted to our internal fabrication operations as well as management of outsourced activities 
for selected customers  we maintain finished goods inventory near or at customer manufacturing sites to support their just in time production 
materials and suppliers our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of semiconductors  electromechanical components and assemblies and raw materials 
we purchase materials from hundreds of suppliers on a global basis 
these supply relationships are generally conducted on a purchase order basis 
while we have not experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining the materials used in the conduct of our business and we believe that no single supplier is material  some of the parts are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for re design or qualification 
our long term relationships with our suppliers allow us to proactively manage our technology development and product discontinuance plans  and to monitor our suppliers financial health 
some suppliers may nonetheless extend their lead times  limit supplies  increase prices or cease to produce necessary parts for our products 
if these are unique components  we may not be able to find a substitute quickly  or at all 
to address the potential disruption in our supply chain  we may use a number of techniques  including qualifying multiple sources of supply  redesign of products for alternative components and purchase of incremental inventory for supply buffer 

table of contents competition the global semiconductor market is highly competitive 
our competitors range from large  international companies offering a wide range of products to smaller companies specializing in narrow markets 
we compete with integrated device manufacturers  or idms  and fabless semiconductor companies as well as the internal resources of large  integrated oems 
the competitive landscape is changing as a result of a trend toward consolidation within the industry  as some of our competitors have merged with or been acquired by other competitors while others have begun collaborating with each other 
we expect this consolidation trend to continue 
we expect competition in the markets in which we participate to continue to increase as existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings and as new companies enter the market 
additionally  our ability to compete effectively depends on a number of factors  including quality  technical performance  price  product features  product system compatibility  system level design capability  engineering expertise  responsiveness to customers  new product innovation  product availability  delivery timing and reliability  and customer sales and technical support 
in the wireless communications target market  we provide rf amplifiers  filters modules and ambient light and proximity sensors for mobile phones 
our primary competitors for this target market are hittite microwave corporation  murata manufacturing co  ltd  rf micro devices  inc  skyworks solutions  inc  ams ag formerly taos inc 
and triquint semiconductor  inc we compete based on our expertise in amplifier design  fbar technology and module integration 
we also compete against a number of smaller  niche wireless players based on our proprietary design expertise  broad product portfolio  proprietary material processes and integration expertise 
in the wired infrastructure target market  we provide fiber optic transceivers and serdes asics for high speed data communications and server applications 
our primary competitors for this target market are finisar corporation  international business machines corp  microelectronics division  lsi corporation and st microelectronics nv we compete based on the strength of our high speed proprietary design expertise  our customer relationships  proprietary process technology and broad product portfolio 
in the industrial and automotive electronics target market  we provide fiber optic transceivers for communication networks  leds for displays  motion control encoders and subsystems and optocouplers for factory automation and motor controls 
our primary competitors for this target market are analog devices  inc  heidenhain corporation  renesas electronics corporation and toshiba corporation 
we compete based on our design expertise  broad product portfolio  reputation for quality products and large customer base 
intellectual property our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our intellectual property 
to accomplish this  we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights  including patents  copyrights  trademarks  service marks  trade secrets and similar intellectual property  as well as customary contractual protections with our customers  suppliers  employees and consultants  and through security measures to protect our trade secrets 
we believe our current product expertise  key engineering talent and intellectual property portfolio provide us with a strong platform from which to develop application specific products in key target markets 
as of october   we had approximately  us and  foreign patents and approximately us and foreign pending patent applications 
our research and development efforts are presently resulting in approximately new patent applications per year relating to a wide range of asic  isolation  encoder  led  rf and optoelectronic components and associated applications 
the expiration dates of our patents range from to  with a small number of patents expiring in the near future  none of which are expected to be material to our intellectual property portfolio 
we focus our patent application program to a greater extent on those inventions and improvements that we believe are likely to be incorporated into our products as contrasted with more basic research 
however  we do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or the extent to which the examination process could require us to narrow our claims 
a meaningful portion of our intellectual property is the subject of cross licenses to other companies that have been granted by agilent technologies  inc  or if originally derived from hewlett packard company  by hewlett packard company 
in addition  we license third party technologies that are incorporated into some elements of our design activities  products and manufacturing processes 
historically  licenses of the third party technologies used by us have been available to us on acceptable terms 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents  copyrights  trademarks and trade secrets and by the vigorous pursuit  protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights 
many of our customer agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third party intellectual property infringement claims  which has in the past required and may in the future require that we defend those claims  and might also require that we pay damages in the case of adverse rulings 
claims of this sort could harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from 
table of contents doing business with us 
with respect to any intellectual property rights claims against us or our customers or distributors  we may be required to cease manufacture of the infringing product  pay damages  expend resources to develop non infringing technology  seek a license which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all  or relinquish patents or other intellectual property rights 
employees as of october   we had approximately  employees worldwide 
approximately  were dedicated to research and development   to manufacturing  to sales and marketing and to general and administrative functions 
by geography  approximately of our employees are located in asia  in north america and in europe 
the substantial majority of our employees are not party to a collective bargaining agreement 
however  approximately of our  employees in singapore  none of whom are in management or supervisory positions  are subject to a collective bargaining agreement with united workers of electronic and electrical industries that expires on june  in addition  all of our employees in italy and some employees in japan are subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
in italy we are also subject to national collective agreements between unions and employer associations 
such italian national collective agreements are compulsory for both the employees and the employer 
in addition  in germany we are subject to collective agreements with the works councils at our sites  which apply to german employees other than managing directors and managers with similar authority 
we believe we have a good working relationship with our employees and we have never experienced an interruption of business as a result of labor disputes 
environmental and other regulation our research and development and manufacturing operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international  federal  state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment 
these regulations include limitations on discharge of pollutants to air  water  and soil  remediation requirements  product chemical content limitations  manufacturing chemical use and handling restrictions  pollution control requirements  waste minimization considerations  and treatment  transport  storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes 
we are also subject to regulation by the united states occupational safety and health administration and similar health and safety laws in other jurisdictions 
we believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and worker health and safety laws  however  the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental and health and safety laws to our business will not require us to incur significant expenditures 
we are also regulated under a number of international  federal  state and local laws regarding recycling  product packaging and product content requirements  including legislation enacted in the european union and china  among a growing number of jurisdictions  which have placed greater restrictions on the use of lead  among other chemicals  in electronic products  which affects materials composition and semiconductor packaging 
these laws are becoming more stringent and may in the future cause us to incur significant expenditures 
we are also subject to new sec rules that require diligence  disclosure and reporting on whether certain minerals and metals  known as conflict minerals  used in our products originate from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries 
among other things  the implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing  availability and pricing of minerals we use in our products  will require us to incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements and we may face difficulties in satisfying customers who require that all of the products are certified as conflict mineral free 
backlog our sales are generally made pursuant to short term purchase orders 
these purchase orders are made without deposits and may be  and often are  rescheduled  canceled or modified on relatively short notice  and in most cases without substantial penalty 
therefore  we believe that purchase orders or backlog are not necessarily a reliable indicator of future sales 
seasonality we are affected by seasonal trends in the semiconductor and related industries 
we typically experience sequentially lower revenues in the first half of the fiscal year 
historically  our revenue in the second half of the fiscal year is typically higher than our revenue in the first half of the fiscal year due to seasonality in our wireless communications target market 
this target market historically tended to experience seasonality due to the calendar year end holiday selling seasons and related oem product launches 
however  oem product launches and transitions in the wireless communications target market are becoming increasingly unpredictable in both timing and magnitude 
in addition  these seasonal effects can also be overshadowed by other factors such as macroeconomic effects

table of contents risk factors our business  operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties  including those described below  that could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows  and the trading price of our ordinary shares 
the following important factors  among others  could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements made by us or on our behalf in filings with the sec  press releases  communications with investors and oral statements 
risks related to our business adverse global economic conditions could have a negative effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition and liquidity 
adverse global economic conditions have from time to time caused or exacerbated significant slowdowns in the semiconductor industry generally  as well as in our target markets 
the global recession in and caused us and foreign businesses to slow spending on our products and caused consumers to reduce spending on many products our customers make  such as personal computers  mobile phone and flat screen televisions 
recently  market and business conditions in general have been adversely affected by investor and customer concerns about the global economic outlook  including concerns about the economic recovery in the united states and the ongoing sovereign debt crisis in europe 
us and global economic conditions could be exacerbated by the negative effects on economic growth resulting from the combination of federal income tax increases and government spending restrictions potentially occurring at the end of calendar year in the united states commonly referred to as the fiscal cliff 
a slowdown in the economic recovery or worsening global economic conditions as a result of these or other factors will likely cause our customers and consumers to reduce or delay spending  and could lead to the insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays and customers  all of which could negatively affect our business  financial condition and result of operations 
we operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry  which is subject to significant downturns 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change and price erosion  evolving technical standards  frequent new product introductions  short product life cycles for semiconductors and for the end user products in which they are used and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
from time to time  these and other factors  together with changes in general economic conditions  cause significant upturns and downturns in the industry in general and in our business in particular 
periods of industry downturns have been characterized by diminished demand for end user products  high inventory levels and periods of inventory adjustment  under utilization of manufacturing capacity  changes in revenue mix and accelerated erosion of average selling prices  resulting in an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we expect our business to continue to be subject to cyclical downturns even when overall economic conditions are relatively stable 
in addition  in any future economic downturn we may be unable to grow our revenues or reduce our costs quickly enough to maintain our operating profitability 
our operating results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations 
our revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future 
these fluctuations may occur on a quarterly and annual basis and are due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include  among others changes in end user demand for the products manufactured and sold by our customers  the timing of receipt  reduction or cancellation of significant orders by customers  fluctuations in the levels of component inventories held by our customers  customer concentration and the gain or loss of significant customers  market acceptance of our products and our customers products  changes in our product mix or customer mix and their effect on our gross margin  our ability to develop  introduce and market new products and technologies on a timely basis  the timing and extent of our non product revenue  such as product development revenues and royalty and other payments from intellectual property sales and licensing arrangements  new product announcements and introductions by us or our competitors  the timing of the launch by our customers of new products  such as cell phones  in which our products are included  
table of contents timing and amount of research and development and related new product expenditures  and the timing of receipt of any research and development grant monies  seasonality or cyclical fluctuations in our markets  currency fluctuations  utilization of our internal manufacturing facilities  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  significant warranty claims  including those not covered by our suppliers or our insurers  availability and cost of raw materials from our suppliers  intellectual property disputes and associated litigation expenses  loss of key personnel or the shortage of available skilled workers  the effects of competitive pricing pressures  including decreases in average selling prices of our products  and changes in our tax incentive arrangements or structure  which may adversely affect our net tax expense in any quarter in which such an event occurs 
the foregoing factors are difficult to forecast  and these  as well as other factors  could materially adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results 
in addition  a significant amount of our operating expenses are relatively fixed in nature due to our significant sales  research and development and internal manufacturing overhead costs 
any failure to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for a revenue shortfall could magnify the adverse impact of such revenue shortfall on our results of operations 
as a result  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful or a reliable indicator of our future performance 
if our operating results in one or more future quarters fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of our ordinary shares may occur 
the demands or loss of one or more of our significant customers may adversely affect our business 
some of our customers are material to our business and results of operations 
during fiscal year  foxconn technology group companies together accounted for of our net revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and our top customers  which included three distributors  collectively accounted for of our net revenue 
during fiscal year  no direct customer accounted for or more of our net revenue  but our top customers  which included three distributors  collectively accounted for of our net revenue 
we also believe that aggregate sales of our products to certain of our customers exceeds the amount of our direct sales to them 
for example  we believe our aggregate sales to two oems  when direct sales are combined with indirect sales to them through the respective contract manufacturers that they utilize  each accounted for more than of our net revenues  respectively  for fiscal year this customer concentration increases the risk of quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and operating results 
in addition  our top customers purchasing power has  in some cases  given them the ability to make greater demands on us with regard to pricing and contractual terms in general 
we expect this trend to continue  which may adversely affect our gross margins on certain products 
in addition  we expect this will result in our results of operations becoming increasingly sensitive to deterioration in the financial condition of  or other adverse developments related to  one or more of our significant customers 
although we believe that our relationships with our major customers are good  we generally do not have long term contracts with any of them  which is typical of our industry 
as a result  although our customers provide indications of their product needs and purchases on an annual basis  they generally purchase our products on a weekly or daily basis and the relationship  as well as particular orders  can be terminated at any time 
in order to ensure availability of our products for some of our largest customers  we start the manufacturing of our products in advance of receiving purchase orders  based on forecasts provided by these customers 
however  these forecasts are not binding purchase commitments and as a result  we incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales 
since actual demand for our products may not match these forecasts  manufacturing based on such forecasts subjects us to increased risks of high inventory carrying costs  increased obsolescence and increased operating costs 
in addition  the loss of any of our major customers  or any substantial reduction in sales to any of these customers  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are increasingly dependent on the mobile handset market  which is volatile and is characterized by short product life cycles  fluctuations in demand  seasonality and increasingly high customer concentration any of which could negatively impact our business or results of operations 
a substantial and increasing portion of our revenue is generated from sales of products for use in mobile handsets 
the mobile handset market is characterized by intense competition among an increasingly concentrated group of oems  rapidly 
table of contents evolving technology  and changing consumer preferences 
these factors result in the frequent introduction of new products  aggressive price competition  short product life cycles  and continually evolving mobile handset specifications 
if we  our customers or mobile handset oems are unable to manage product transitions  our business and results of operations could be negatively affected 
our business is also dependent on the broad commercial acceptance of the mobile handsets into which our products are incorporated 
if the mobile handsets into which our products are designed do not achieve significant customer acceptance  our revenue will be adversely affected 
similarly  even though we may achieve design wins for a particular handset  we may not be designed into the next generation of a particular handset or new model of handset  which could result in a sharp decrease in our revenues 
in the mobile handset market  demand is typically stronger in the second half of the year than the first half of the year 
however  if mobile handset oems inaccurately forecast consumer demand  this may lead to significant changes in orders to their component suppliers 
we have experienced both increases and decreases in orders within the same quarter and with limited advance notice  and we expect such increases and decreases to occur in the future 
in addition  although the worldwide wireless handset market is large  growth trends and other variables are often uncertain and difficult to predict 
since the wireless handset market is a consumer driven market  changes in the economy that affect consumer demand can adversely affect our business and operating results 
winning business is subject to lengthy  competitive selection processes that require us to incur significant expense 
even if we begin a product design  a customer may decide to cancel or change its product plans  which could cause us to generate no revenues from a product and adversely affect our results of operations 
we are focused on winning competitive bid selection processes  known as design wins  to develop semiconductors for use in our customers products 
these selection processes are typically lengthy and can require us to incur significant design and development expenditures and dedicate scarce engineering resources in pursuit of a single customer opportunity 
we may not win the competitive selection process and may never generate any revenue despite incurring significant design and development expenditures 
these risks are exacerbated by the fact that many of our products and the end products into which our products are incorporated often have very short life cycles 
for example  cell phone manufacturers regularly introduce new or upgraded handsets  often every to months and sometimes more frequently  and will bid out the components for each new model  and often every upgrade of a particular model 
failure to obtain a design win sometimes prevents us from offering an entire generation of a product 
this can result in lost revenues and could weaken our position in future competitive selection processes 
winning a product design does not guarantee sales to a customer 
we may experience delays in generating revenue from our products as a result of the lengthy development cycle typically required  or may not realize as much revenue as we had anticipated 
in addition  a delay or cancellation of a customer s plans could materially and adversely affect our financial results  as we may have incurred significant expense in the design process and generated little or no revenue 
customers could choose at any time to stop using our products or may fail to successfully market and sell their products  which could reduce demand for our products and materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
finally  the timing of design wins is unpredictable and implementing production for a major design win or multiple design wins occurring at or around the same time may strain our resources and those of our contract manufacturers 
in such event we may be forced to dedicate significant additional resources and incur additional  unanticipated costs and expenses to fulfill such design wins  which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
competition in our industry could prevent us from growing our revenue and from raising prices to offset increases in costs 
the global semiconductor market is highly competitive 
we compete in different target markets to various degrees on the basis of  among other things  quality  technical performance  price  product features  product system compatibility  system level design capability  engineering expertise  responsiveness to customers  new product innovation  product availability  delivery timing and reliability  and customer sales and technical support 
current and prospective customers for our products evaluate our capabilities against the merits of our direct competitors 
some of our competitors are well established  have a more extensive product portfolio  have substantially greater market share and manufacturing  financial  research and development and marketing resources to pursue development  engineering  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of their products 
in addition  many of our competitors have longer independent operating histories  greater presence in key markets  more comprehensive patent protection and greater name recognition 
we compete with integrated device manufacturers  or idms  and fabless semiconductor companies as well as the internal resources of large  integrated oems 
our competitors range from large  international companies offering a wide range of semiconductor products to smaller companies specializing in narrow markets 
we expect competition in the markets in which we participate to continue to increase as existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings 
in addition  companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future 
because our products are often building block semiconductors providing functions that in some cases can be integrated into more complex integrated circuits  or ics  we also face competition from manufacturers of ics  as well as customers that develop their own ic products 

table of contents our ability to compete successfully depends on elements both within and outside of our control  including industry and general economic trends 
during past periods of downturns in our industry  competition in the markets in which we operate intensified as manufacturers of semiconductors reduced prices in order to combat production overcapacity and high inventory levels 
the actions of our competitors  particularly in the area of pricing  can have a substantial adverse impact on our revenues  and potentially on revenues in specific industry end markets 
in periods where the semiconductor industry experiences significant declines  manufacturers in financial difficulties or in bankruptcy may implement pricing structures designed to ensure short term market share and near term survival  rather than securing long term viability 
in addition  many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than us with which to withstand adverse economic or market conditions and any associated pricing actions of other market participants in the future 
dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation 
we operate a primarily outsourced manufacturing business model that principally utilizes third party foundry and module assembly and test capabilities 
as a result  we are highly reliant on third party foundry wafer fabrication capacity  including sole or single sourcing for many components or products 
for certain of our product families  substantially all of our revenue from those products is derived from semiconductors fabricated by external foundries such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd 
and win semiconductor corp 
most of our products are designed to be manufactured in a specific process  typically at one particular foundry with a particular contract manufacturer 
we also use third party contract manufacturers for a significant majority of our assembly and test operations  including amertron incorporated  ase korea inc  and hana 
the ability and willingness of our contract manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control 
if one or more of our contract manufacturers or other outsourced providers fails to perform its obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels  our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer 
suppliers may  for example  extend lead times  limit supplies  increase prices or discontinue parts due to capacity constraints or other factors 
in addition  some parts are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work 
if one of our suppliers  particularly a sole or single source supplier  ceases to  or is unable to  manufacture such a component or supply is otherwise constrained  for example as a result of a natural disaster  it may be difficult for us to transition the manufacture of that product to another foundry or contract manufacturer or source alternative parts  we may be forced to re engineer a product and we may fail to timely meet customer demand 
this could result in the payment of significant damages by us to our customers  and our net revenue could decline 
in such events  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 
furthermore  our agreements with these manufacturers typically require us to forecast product needs and our forecasts may not be accurate  which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we review our supply chain on an ongoing basis and may seek to qualify second source manufacturers and suppliers for some components and products 
qualifying such second sources may be a lengthy and potentially costly process 
to the extent we rely on third party manufacturing relationships  we face the following risks inability of our manufacturers to develop manufacturing methods appropriate for our products  and manufacturers lack of sufficient capacity  or their unwillingness to devote adequate capacity  to produce our products  product and manufacturing costs that are higher than anticipated  reduced control over product reliability and delivery schedules  more complicated supply chains  and time  expense and uncertainty in identifying and qualifying additional or replacement manufacturers 
much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries  and as a result may additionally be subject to geopolitical uncertainty 
see our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the political and economic conditions of the countries in which we conduct business and other factors related to our international operations 
a prolonged disruption of our manufacturing facilities or other significant operations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
although we operate using a primarily outsourced manufacturing business model  we also rely on the manufacturing facilities we own  in particular our fabrication facilities in fort collins  colorado and singapore 
we maintain our internal fabrication facilities for products utilizing our innovative materials and processes  to protect our intellectual property  to develop the technology for manufacturing and to ensure supply of certain components 
we are currently expanding our fort collins facility to support anticipated growth in sales of our proprietary products  particularly for our wireless target market  and to leverage our fixed costs 
unanticipated delays in the construction of this expansion  or the failure of suppliers to timely deliver tools and other equipment needed to commence manufacturing in the expanded facility  could result in significant additional costs  and could result in us being unable to timely satisfy customer demand for the products we plan to 
table of contents manufacture at the expanded facility  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  a prolonged disruption or material malfunction of  interruption in  or the loss of operations at  one or more of our production facilities  especially our fort collins and singapore facilities  or the failure to maintain our labor force at one or more of these facilities  would limit our capacity to meet customer demands and delay new product development until a replacement facility and equipment  if necessary  were found 
the replacement of any of our manufacturing facilities could take an extended amount of time and significant expenditures on our part before manufacturing operations could restart 
the potential delays and significant costs resulting from such steps could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are also dependent on various information technology systems  including  but not limited to  networks  applications  and outsourced services 
we continually enhance and implement new systems and processes throughout our global operations 
failure of these systems to operate effectively  could disrupt our operations and materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations by harming our ability to accurately forecast sales demand  manage our supply chain and production facilities  fulfill customer orders  and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis 
if we or our contract manufacturers suffer loss or significant damage to our factories  facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe  our operations could be seriously harmed 
our factories  facilities and distribution system  and those of our contract manufacturers  are subject to risk of catastrophic loss due to fire  flood  earthquake or other natural or man made disasters 
the majority of our facilities and those of our contract manufacturers are located in the pacific rim region  a region with above average seismic and severe weather activity 
in addition  our research and development personnel are concentrated in a few locations  primarily malaysia  singapore  south korea  fort collins  colorado and san jose  california  with the expertise of the personnel at each such location tending to be focused on one or two specific areas 
any catastrophic natural disaster in those regions or catastrophic loss or significant damage to any of our facilities or those of our contract manufacturers in those regions would likely disrupt our operations  delay production  shipments and revenue 
such events could also result in significant expenses to repair or replace our affected facilities  and in some instances could significantly curtail our research and development efforts in a particular product area or target market 
any catastrophic loss at our fort collins  colorado  san jose  california  or singapore facilities would materially and adversely affect our business 
we generally do not have any long term supply contracts with our contract manufacturers or materials suppliers and may not be able to obtain the products or raw materials required for our business  which could have a material adverse affect on our business 
we either obtain the products we need for our business from third party contract manufacturers or we obtain the materials we need for our products from suppliers  some of which are our single source suppliers for these materials 
we purchase a significant portion of our semiconductor materials and finished goods from a few suppliers and contract manufacturers 
for fiscal year  we purchased of the materials for our manufacturing processes from six suppliers 
for fiscal year  we purchased of the materials for our manufacturing processes from seven suppliers 
substantially all of our purchases are on a purchase order basis  and we have not generally entered into long term contracts with our contract manufacturers or suppliers 
in the event that these purchase orders or relationships with suppliers are terminated  we cannot obtain sufficient quantities of raw materials at reasonable prices  the quality of the material deteriorates  we fail to satisfy our customers requirements or we are not able to pass on higher materials or energy costs to our customers  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted 
our manufacturing processes rely on many materials  including silicon and gaas wafers  copper lead frames  precious metals  mold compound  ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases 
from time to time  suppliers may extend lead times  limit supplies or increase prices due to commodity price increases  capacity constraints or other factors 
although we believe that our current supplies of materials are adequate  shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry 

table of contents failure to adjust our supply chain volume due to changing market or other conditions or failure to accurately estimate our customers demand could adversely affect our results of operations 
we make significant decisions  including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept  production schedules  levels of reliance on contract manufacturing and outsourcing  personnel needs and other resource requirements  based on our estimates of customer requirements 
the short term nature of commitments by many of our customers and the possibility of rapid changes in demand for their products reduces our ability to accurately estimate future customer requirements 
our results of operations could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our supply chain volume to address market fluctuations  including those caused by the seasonal or cyclical nature of the markets in which we operate  or by other unanticipated events such as natural disasters 
in addition  the sale of our products is dependent  to a large degree  on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal or cyclical trends in the demand for their products 
for example  the consumer electronics market is particularly volatile and is subject to seasonality related to the holiday selling season  making demand difficult to anticipate 
severe supply chain disruptions  such as those caused by large scale natural disasters  can adversely affect our  and our customers  ability to source materials and components needed to manufacture products 
in such event  even if we are able to promptly resume production of our affected products  if our customers cannot timely resume their own manufacturing following such an event  they may cancel or scale back their orders from us and this may in turn adversely affect our results of operations 
on occasion  customers may require rapid increases in production  which can challenge our resources and reduce margins 
we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components or secure sufficient contract manufacturing capacity  to meet such increases in product demand 
this could harm our reputation  prevent us from taking advantage of opportunities  reduce revenue growth and subject us to additional liabilities if we are not able to timely satisfy customer orders 
in order to secure components for the production of our products  we may enter into non cancelable purchase commitments with vendors or make advance payments to suppliers  which could reduce our ability to adjust our inventory or expense levels to declining market demands 
prior commitments of this type have resulted in an excess of parts when demand for our products has decreased 
downturns in the semiconductor industry have in the past caused  and may in the future cause  our customers to reduce significantly the amount of products ordered from us 
if demand for our products is less than we expect  we may experience excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges 
conversely  if oems order more of our products in any particular quarter than are ultimately required to satisfy end customer demand  inventories at these oems may grow in such quarter  which could adversely affect our product revenues in a subsequent quarter as such oems would likely reduce future orders until their inventory levels realign with end customer demand 
in addition  because certain of our sales  research and development and internal manufacturing overhead expenses are relatively fixed  a reduction in customer demand may decrease our gross margins and operating income 
our operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline 
visibility into our markets is limited and any decline in our customers markets would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products 
in such an environment  pricing pressures could intensify and  if we were unable to respond quickly  could significantly reduce our gross margins 
to the extent we cannot offset recessionary periods or periods of reduced growth that may occur in these markets through increased market share or otherwise  our net revenue may decline and our business  financial condition and results of operations may suffer 
for example  we experienced continued  and worse than expected  supply chain corrections and weakness in industrial spending  in china in particular  in fiscal year  which adversely affected our revenues and gross margin 
pricing pressures and competition are especially intense in semiconductor related industries  which could prevent achievement of our long term financial goals and could require us to implement additional cost cutting measures 
furthermore  industry growth rates may not be as forecasted  which could result in us spending on process and product development well ahead of market requirements  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we rely on third parties to provide corporate infrastructure services necessary for the operation of our business 
any failure of one or more of our vendors to provide these services could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we rely on third party vendors to provide critical corporate infrastructure services  including  among other things  certain services related to accounting  billing  human resources  information technology  or it  network development and network monitoring 
we depend on these vendors to ensure that our corporate infrastructure will consistently meet our business requirements 
the ability of these third party vendors to successfully provide reliable  high quality services is subject to technical and operational uncertainties that are beyond our control 
while we may be entitled to damages if our vendors fail to perform under their agreements with us  our agreements with these vendors limit the amount of damages we may receive 
in addition  we do not know whether we will be able to collect on any award of damages or that any such damages would be sufficient to cover the actual costs we would incur as a result of any vendor s failure to perform under its agreement with us 
any failure of our corporate infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and 
table of contents results of operations 
upon expiration or termination of any of our agreements with third party vendors  we may not be able to replace the services provided to us in a timely manner or on terms and conditions  including service levels and cost  that are favorable to us and a transition from one vendor to another vendor could subject us to operational delays and inefficiencies until the transition is complete 
our gross margin is dependent on a number of factors  including our product mix  customer mix  commodity prices and level of capacity utilization 
our gross margin is highly dependent on product mix  with proprietary products and products sold into our industrial and automotive target market typically providing higher gross margin than other products 
a shift in sales mix away from our higher margin products could adversely affect our future gross margin percentages 
in addition  oems are becoming increasingly price conscious when they design semiconductors from third party suppliers into their products 
this sensitivity  combined with large oems purchasing power  can lead to intense price competition among competing suppliers  which may require us to decrease our prices in order to win a design with an oem customer 
this can  in turn  adversely affect our gross margin 
our margin may also be affected by fluctuations in commodity prices  either directly in the price of the raw materials we buy  or as a result of prices increases passed on to us by our suppliers 
many commodities prices  including those of gold and fuel  have risen significantly in recent months 
we do not hedge our exposure to commodity prices and continued increases in commodities prices may adversely affect our gross margin 
our gross margin is also affected by the timing and amount of our non product revenue  including non refundable payments from customers for research and development projects during product development and intellectual property related revenue such as licensing royalty payments and revenues from sales of intellectual property 
our non product revenue is generally high margin  but fluctuates significantly from quarter to quarter 
in addition  semiconductor manufacturing requires significant capital investment  leading to high fixed costs  including depreciation expense 
although we outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing activities  we do retain some semiconductor fabrication facilities 
we are making substantial capital investments in our fort collins  colorado manufacturing facility and we may not realize the benefit we anticipate from these investments 
if we are unable to utilize our owned fabrication facilities at a high level  the fixed costs associated with these facilities  such as depreciation expense  will not be fully absorbed  resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross margins 
in the past  we have experienced periods where our gross margins declined due to  among other things  reduced factory utilization resulting from reduced customer demand  reduced selling prices and a change in product mix towards lower margin devices 
increased competition and the existence of product alternatives  more complex engineering requirements  lower demand and other factors may lead to further price erosion  lower revenues and lower margins for us in the future 
if the tax incentive or tax holiday arrangements we have negotiated in singapore and other jurisdictions change or cease to be in effect or applicable  in part or in whole  for any reason  or if our assumptions and interpretations regarding tax laws and incentive or holiday arrangements prove to be incorrect  the amount of corporate income taxes we have to pay could significantly increase 
we have structured our operations to maximize the benefit from various tax incentives and tax holidays extended to us in various jurisdictions to encourage investment or employment 
for example  we have obtained several tax incentives from the singapore economic development board  an agency of the government of singapore  which provide that certain classes of income we earn in singapore are subject to tax holidays or reduced rates of singapore income tax 
each such tax incentive is separate and distinct from the others  and may be granted  withheld  extended  modified  truncated  complied with or terminated independently without any effect on the other incentives 
in order to retain these tax benefits in singapore  we must meet certain operating conditions specific to each incentive relating to  among other things  maintenance of a treasury function  a corporate headquarters function  specified intellectual property activities and specified manufacturing activities in singapore 
some of these operating conditions are subject to phase in periods through the singapore tax incentives are presently scheduled to expire at various dates generally between and absent such tax incentives  the corporate income tax rate in singapore that would otherwise apply to us would be 
for the fiscal years ended october   and october   the effect of all these tax incentives  in the aggregate  was to reduce the overall provision for income taxes from what it otherwise would have been in such year by approximately million and million  respectively 
the tax incentives that we have negotiated in malaysia are also subject to our compliance with various operating and other conditions 
if we cannot or elect not to comply with the operating conditions included in any particular tax incentive  we will lose the related tax benefits 
in such event  we could be required to refund material tax benefits previously realized by us with respect to that incentive and  depending on the incentive at issue  could likely be required to modify our operational structure and tax strategy 
any such modified structure or strategy may not be as beneficial to us from an income tax expense or operational perspective as the benefits provided under the present tax concession arrangements 
our interpretations and conclusions regarding the tax incentives are not binding on any taxing authority  and if our assumptions about tax and other laws are incorrect or if these tax incentives are substantially modified or rescinded we could 
table of contents suffer material adverse tax and other financial consequences  which would increase our expenses  reduce our profitability and adversely affect our cash flows 
in addition  taxable income in any jurisdiction is dependent upon acceptance of our operational practices and intercompany transfer pricing by local tax authorities as being on an arm s length basis 
due to inconsistencies in application of the arm s length standard among taxing authorities  as well as lack of adequate treaty based protection  transfer pricing challenges by tax authorities could  if successful  substantially increase our income tax expense 
we are subject to  and are under  audit in various jurisdictions  and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax against us 
although we believe our tax positions are reasonable  the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from our recorded income tax provisions and accruals 
the ultimate results of an audit could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 
we may be subject to claims of infringement of third party intellectual property rights or demands that we license third party technology  which could result in significant expense and loss of our intellectual property rights 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by companies holding large numbers of patents  copyrights  trademarks and trade secrets and by the vigorous pursuit  protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights  including actions by patent holding companies that do not make or sell products 
from time to time  third parties assert against us and our customers and distributors their patent  copyright  trademark  trade secret and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business 
litigation or settlement of claims that our products or processes infringe or misappropriate these rights  regardless of their merit  are frequently costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel 
in addition  many of our customer agreements  and in some cases our asset sale agreements  require us to indemnify our customers or purchasers for third party intellectual property infringement claims  which have required and may in the future require that we defend those claims  and might require that we pay damages in the case of adverse rulings 
claims of this sort could also harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us 
we do not know whether we will prevail in such proceedings given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation 
if any pending or future proceedings result in an adverse outcome  we could be required to cease the manufacture  use or sale of the infringing products  processes or technology  pay substantial damages for past  present and future use of the infringing technology  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  license technology from the third party claiming infringement  which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  enter into cross licenses with our competitors  which could weaken our overall intellectual property portfolio and our ability to compete in particular product categories  indemnify customers or distributors  pay substantial damages to our customers or end users to discontinue use or replace infringing technology with non infringing technology  or relinquish intellectual property rights associated with one or more of our patent claims  if such claims are held invalid or otherwise unenforceable 
any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we utilize a significant amount of intellectual property in our business 
if we are unable or fail to protect our intellectual property  our business could be adversely affected 
our success depends in part upon protecting our intellectual property 
to accomplish this  we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights  including patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets and similar intellectual property  as well as customary contractual protections with our customers  suppliers  employees and consultants 
we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights  and even with significant expenditures we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights valuable to our business 
we are unable to predict that intellectual property rights that we presently employ in our business will not lapse or be invalidated  circumvented  challenged  or  in the case of third party intellectual property rights  licensed or sub licensed to us  be licensed to others  our intellectual property rights will provide competitive advantages to us  
table of contents rights previously granted by third parties to intellectual property rights licensed or assigned to us  including portfolio cross licenses  will not hamper our ability to assert our intellectual property rights against potential competitors or hinder the settlement of currently pending or future disputes  any of our pending or future patent  trademark or copyright applications will be issued or have the coverage originally sought  or our intellectual property rights will be enforced in certain jurisdictions where competition may be intense or where legal protection may be weak 
in addition  our competitors or others may develop products or technologies that are similar or superior to our products or technologies  duplicate our products or technologies or design around our protected technologies 
effective patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or more limited in one or more relevant jurisdictions  relative to those protections available in the united states  may not be applied for or may be abandoned in one or more relevant jurisdictions 
we may elect to abandon or divest patents or otherwise not pursue prosecution of certain pending patent applications due to strategic concerns or other factors 
in addition  when patents expire  we lose the protection and competitive advantages they provided to us 
from time to time we pursue litigation to assert our intellectual property rights  including  in some cases  against third parties with whom we have ongoing relationships  such as customers and suppliers  and third parties may pursue litigation against us 
an adverse decision in such types of legal action could limit our ability to assert our intellectual property rights and limit the value of our technology  including the loss of opportunities to sell or license our technology to others or to collect royalty payments based upon successful protection and assertion of our intellectual property against others 
in addition  such legal actions or adverse decisions could otherwise negatively impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
from time to time we may need to obtain additional intellectual property licenses or renew existing license agreements 
we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms or at all 
we are subject to risks associated with our distributors product inventories and product sell through 
we sell many of our products to customers through distributors who maintain their own inventory of our products for sale to dealers and end users 
we limit distributor return rights and we allow limited price adjustments on sales to distributors 
price adjustments may be effected by way of credits for future product or by cash payments to the distributor either in arrears or in advance based on estimates 
we record reserves for distributor rights related to these limited stock returns and price adjustments 
we recognize revenues for sales to distributors upon delivery to the distributors  net of estimated provisions for these stock return and price adjustment programs 
we have recently extended these programs with certain distributors in china and intend to extend them on a selective basis to some of our other distributors in other geographies 
the reserves recorded for these programs are based on significant judgments and estimates  using historical experience rates  inventory levels in distribution  current trends and other factors  and there could be significant differences between actual amounts and our estimates 
in addition  the timing and mix of payments and credits associated with such price adjustments could change over time  which could adversely affect our cash flows 
sales to distributors accounted for and of our net revenue for fiscal year and fiscal year  respectively 
if our distributors are unable to sell an adequate amount of their inventory of our products in a given quarter to dealers and end users or if they decide to decrease their inventories for any reason  such as due to adverse global economic conditions or due to any downturn in technology spending  our sales to these distributors and our revenues may decline 
we also face the risk that our distributors may purchase  or for other reasons accumulate  inventory levels of our products in any particular quarter in excess of future anticipated sales to end customers 
if such sales do not occur in the time frame anticipated by these distributors for any reason  these distributors may substantially decrease the amount of product they order from us in subsequent periods until their inventory levels realign with end customer demand  which would harm our business and could adversely affect our product revenues in such subsequent periods 
our reserve estimates associated with products stocked by our distributors are based largely on reports that our distributors provide to us on a monthly basis 
to date  we believe this data has been generally accurate 
to the extent that this resale and channel inventory data is inaccurate or not received in a timely manner  we may not be able to make reserve estimates for future periods accurately or at all 
unless we and our suppliers continuously improve manufacturing efficiency and quality  our financial performance could be adversely affected 
manufacturing semiconductors involves highly complex processes that require advanced equipment 
we and our suppliers  as well as our competitors  continuously modify these processes in an effort to improve yields and product performance 
defects or other difficulties in the manufacturing process can reduce yields and increase costs 
our manufacturing efficiency will be an important factor in our future financial performance  and we may be unable to maintain or increase our manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors 
for products that we outsource manufacturing  our product yields and performance will be subject to the manufacturing efficiencies of our third party suppliers 

table of contents from time to time  we and our suppliers have experienced difficulty in beginning production at new facilities  transferring production to other facilities  achieving and maintaining a high level of process quality and effecting transitions to new manufacturing processes  all of which have caused us to suffer delays in product deliveries or reduced yields 
we and our suppliers may experience manufacturing problems in achieving acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays in the future as a result of  among other things  capacity constraints  construction delays  transferring production to other facilities  upgrading or expanding existing facilities  including our fort collins facility  or changing our process technologies  any of which could result in a loss of future revenues 
our results of operations could be adversely affected by any increase in costs related to increases in production capacity if revenues do not increase proportionately 
the enactment of legislation implementing changes in us taxation of international business activities or the adoption of other tax reform policies could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
tax bills are introduced from time to time to reform us taxation of international business activities 
depending on the final form of legislation enacted  if any  these consequences may be significant for us due to the large scale of our international business activities 
if any of these proposals are enacted into legislation  they could have material adverse consequences on the amount of tax we pay and thereby on our financial position and results of operations 
we make substantial investments in research and development to improve existing and develop new technologies to remain competitive in our business and unsuccessful investments could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the semiconductor industry requires substantial investment in research and development in order to develop and bring to market new and enhanced technologies and products 
in order to remain competitive  we have made significant investments in research and development and anticipate that we will need to maintain or increase our levels of research and development expenditures 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future  due to the increasing complexity and number of products we plan to develop 
the technologies where we have focused or may focus our research and development expenditures may not become commercially successful 
significant investments in unsuccessful research and development efforts could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  increased investments in research and development could cause our cost structure to fall out of alignment with demand for our products  which would have a negative impact on our financial results 
our business would be adversely affected by the departure of existing members of our senior management team or if our senior management team is unable to effectively implement our strategy 
our success depends  in large part  on the continued contributions of our senior management team  in particular  the services of mr 
hock e 
tan  our president and chief executive officer 
none of our senior management is bound by written employment contracts to remain with us for a specified period 
in addition  we do not currently maintain key person life insurance covering our senior management 
the loss of any of our senior management could harm our ability to implement our business strategy and respond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which we operate 
if we are unable to attract  train and retain qualified personnel  especially our design and technical personnel  we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively 
our future success depends on our ability to retain  attract and motivate qualified personnel  including our management  sales and marketing  legal and finance  and especially our design and technical personnel 
we do not know whether we will be able to retain all of these employees as we continue to pursue our business strategy 
we have historically encountered difficulties in hiring and retaining qualified engineers because there is a limited pool of engineers with expertise in analog and optoelectronic semiconductor design 
competition for such personnel is intense in the semiconductor industry  particularly in southeast asia where qualified engineers are currently in high demand 
as the source of our technological and product innovations  our design and technical personnel represent a significant asset 
the loss of the services of key employees  especially our key design and technical personnel  or our inability to retain  attract and motivate qualified design and technical personnel  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to warranty claims  product recalls and product liability 
we are currently  and from time to time may be  subject to warranty or product liability claims that have lead  and may in the future lead  to significant expenses as we compensate affected customers for costs incurred related to product quality issues 
although we maintain reserves for reasonably estimable liabilities and purchase product liability insurance  our reserves may be inadequate to cover the uninsured portion of such claims 
conversely  in some cases  amounts we reserve may ultimately exceed our actual liability for particular claims and may need to be reversed 
for example  in the second quarter of fiscal year we identified a product quality issue with a particular component that we took steps to correct  including notifying our customers  offering to replace such components and provide customers with appropriate financial 
table of contents compensation 
through fiscal year  we had recorded an aggregate of million in charges including reversals of warranty accrual of million and million in the years ended october  and october   respectively associated with this issue 
although we maintain product liability insurance  such insurance is subject to significant deductibles and there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims  or we may elect to self insure with respect to certain matters 
we may incur costs and expenses in the event of any recall of a customer s product containing one of our devices 
the process of identifying a recalled product in devices that have been widely distributed may be lengthy and require significant resources  and we may incur significant replacement costs  contract damage claims from our customers and reputational harm 
our customer contracts typically contain warranty and indemnification provisions  and in certain cases may also contain liquidated damages provisions  relating to product quality issues 
the potential liabilities associated with such provisions are significant  and in some cases  including in agreements with some of our largest customers  are potentially unlimited 
any such liabilities may greatly exceed any revenues we receive from the relevant products 
costs  payments or damages incurred or paid by us in connection with warranty and product liability claims and product recalls could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
the complexity of our products could result in unforeseen delays or expenses or undetected defects or bugs  which could adversely affect the market acceptance of new products  damage our reputation with current or prospective customers  and materially and adversely affect our operating costs 
highly complex products such as the products that we offer  may contain defects and bugs when they are first introduced or as new versions are released  or their release may be delayed due to unforeseen difficulties during product development 
we have in the past experienced  and may in the future experience  these defects  bugs and delays 
if any of our products contain defects or bugs  or have reliability  quality or compatibility problems  we may not be able to successfully design workarounds 
consequently  our reputation may be damaged and customers may be reluctant to buy our products  which could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers  attract new customers  and our financial results 
in addition  these defects or bugs could interrupt or delay sales to our customers 
to resolve these problems  we may have to invest significant capital and other resources 
although our products are tested by our suppliers  our customers and ourselves  it is possible that our new products will contain defects or bugs 
if any of these problems are not found until after we have commenced commercial production of a new product  we may be required to incur additional development costs and product recall  repair or replacement costs 
these problems may also result in claims against us by our customers or others 
for example  if a delay in the manufacture and delivery of our products causes the delay of a customer s product delivery  we may be required  under the terms of our agreement with that customer  to compensate the customer for the adverse effects of such delays 
in addition  these problems may divert our technical and other resources from other development efforts  and we would likely lose  or experience a delay in  market acceptance of the affected product or products  and we could lose credibility with our current and prospective customers 
as a result  our financial results could be materially and adversely affected 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the political and economic conditions of the countries in which we conduct business and other factors related to our international operations 
we sell our products throughout the world 
in addition  as at october   approximately of our employees are located outside of the united states 
multiple factors relating to our international operations and to particular countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
these factors include changes in political  regulatory  legal or economic conditions  restrictive governmental actions  such as restrictions on the transfer or repatriation of funds and foreign investments and trade protection measures  including export duties and quotas and customs duties and tariffs  disruptions of capital and trading markets  changes in import or export licensing requirements  transportation delays  civil disturbances or political instability  geopolitical turmoil  including terrorism  war or political or military coups  changes in labor standards  limitations on our ability under local laws to protect our intellectual property  nationalization of businesses and expropriation of assets  
table of contents changes in tax laws  currency fluctuations  which may result in our products becoming too expensive for foreign customers or foreign sourced materials and services becoming more expensive for us  and difficulty in obtaining distribution and support 
a significant legal risk associated with conducting business internationally is compliance with various and differing anti corruption and anti bribery laws and regulations of the countries in which we do business  including the us foreign corrupt practices act  the uk bribery act and similar laws in china 
in addition  the anti corruption laws in various countries are constantly evolving and may  in some cases  conflict with each other 
our code of ethics and business conduct and other policies prohibit us and our employees from offering or giving anything of value to a government official for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and from engaging in unethical business practices  including kick backs to or from purely private parties 
however  there can be no assurance that all of our employees or agents will refrain from acting in violation of this and our related anti corruption policies and procedures 
any such violation could have a material adverse effect on our business 
a majority of our products are produced and sourced in asia  including in china  malaysia  the philippines  singapore  south korea  taiwan and thailand 
any conflict or uncertainty in these countries  including due to political or civil unrest  public health or safety concerns or natural disasters  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  if the government of any country in which our products are manufactured or sold sets technical standards for products manufactured in or imported into their country that are not widely shared  it may lead certain of our customers to suspend imports of their products into that country  require manufacturers in that country to manufacture products with different technical standards and disrupt cross border manufacturing relationships which  in each case  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  our subsidiaries may require future equity related financing  and any capital contributions to certain of our subsidiaries may require the approval of the relevant authorities in the jurisdiction in which the subsidiary is incorporated 
the approvals are required from the investment commissions or similar agency of the particular jurisdiction and relate to any initial or additional equity investment by foreign entities in local corporations 
our failure to obtain the required approvals and our resulting inability to provide such equity related financing or capital contributions could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not realize the full benefits of our research and development grants 
we have accepted research and development grants  the receipt and amount of which are subject to our satisfaction of certain terms and conditions 
during fiscal year  we recorded an aggregate of million in credits to research and development expense and million as a deferred credit for capital expenditures pursuant to these grants 
during fiscal year  we recorded an aggregate of million in credits to research and development expense and million as a deferred credit for capital expenditures pursuant to these grants 
if we cannot or elect not to satisfy the terms and conditions of any of these grants  expenses incurred in respect of the relevant research and development projects will not be approved for reimbursement  we may be required to return amounts previously paid to us under the grants and further grants may not be available to us in the future 
we may pursue acquisitions  dispositions  investments and joint ventures  which could affect our results of operations 
we may make acquisitions of  and investments in  businesses that offer complementary products  services and technologies  augment our market coverage  or enhance our technological capabilities 
we may also enter into strategic alliances or joint ventures to achieve these goals 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition  investment  alliance  or joint venture opportunities or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions or relationships on terms and conditions acceptable to us  or that such transactions or relationships will be successful 
these transactions or any other acquisitions or dispositions involve risks and uncertainties 
for example  the integration of acquired businesses may not be successful and could result in disruption to other parts of our business 
in addition  the integration may require that we incur significant restructuring charges  including as a result of streamlining  or divesting non core portions of  acquired businesses 
to integrate acquired businesses  we must implement our management information systems  operating systems and internal controls  and assimilate and manage the personnel of the acquired operations 
the difficulties of these integrations may be further complicated by such factors as the size of the business or entity acquired  geographic distances  lack of experience operating in the geographic market or industry sector of the acquired business  delays and challenges associated with integrating the business with our existing businesses  diversion of management s attention from daily operations of the business  potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business  the potential for deficiencies in internal controls at the acquired or combined business  performance problems with the acquired business technology  difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience  exposure to unanticipated liabilities of the acquired business  insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with the acquisition  and our 
table of contents potential inability to achieve the growth prospects and synergies expected from any such acquisition 
even when an acquired business has already developed and marketed products  there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that all pre acquisition due diligence will have identified all material issues that might arise with respect to such acquired business 
any acquisition may also cause us to assume liabilities and ongoing lawsuits  acquire goodwill and non amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing and potential impairment charges  incur amortization expense related to certain intangible assets  increase our expenses and working capital requirements  and subject us to litigation  which would reduce our return on invested capital 
in addition  if the businesses or products lines that we acquire have a different pricing or cost structure than we do  such acquisitions may adversely affect our profitability and reduce our overall margin 
failure to manage and successfully integrate the acquisitions we make or to improve margins of the acquired businesses and products could materially harm our business  operating results and margins 
any future acquisitions may require significant additional debt or equity financing  which  in the case of debt financing  would increase our leverage and potentially affect our credit ratings  and in the case of equity financing  would be dilutive to our existing shareholders 
any downgrades in our credit ratings associated with an acquisition could adversely affect our ability to borrow by resulting in more restrictive borrowing terms 
as a result of the foregoing  we also may not be able to complete acquisitions or other strategic transactions in the future to the same extent as in the past  or at all 
these and other factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability at acquired operations or realize other anticipated benefits of an acquisition  and could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business is subject to various governmental regulations  and compliance with these regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses 
if we fail to maintain compliance with applicable regulations  we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution  and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 
our business is subject to various significant international and us laws and other legal requirements  including packaging  product content  labor and import export regulations 
these regulations are complex  change frequently and have generally become more stringent over time 
we may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations 
any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could result in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations  product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to conduct our operations 
in addition  because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries  we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products 
our products and operations are also subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies  like the international standards organization  as well as regulation by other agencies  such as the us federal communications commission 
if we fail to adequately address any of these rules or regulations  our business could be harmed 
we must conform the manufacture and distribution of our semiconductors to various laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements change 
if we fail to comply with these requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products  we could be required to pay civil penalties  face criminal prosecution and  in some cases  be prohibited from distributing our products commercially until the products or component substances are brought into compliance 
we are subject to environmental  health and safety laws  which could increase our costs  restrict our operations and require expenditures that could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we are subject to a variety of international and us laws and other legal requirements relating to the use  disposal  clean up of and human exposure to  hazardous materials 
any failure by us to comply with environmental  health and safety requirements could result in the limitation or suspension of production or subject us to future liabilities in excess of our reserves 
in addition  compliance with environmental  health and safety requirements could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or require us to acquire costly pollution control equipment  incur other significant expenses or modify our manufacturing processes 
in the event of the discovery of new contamination  additional requirements with respect to existing contamination  or the imposition of other cleanup obligations for which we are responsible  we may be required to take remedial or other measures which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we also face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new requirements relating to the materials composition of our products  including the restrictions on lead and certain other substances in electronics that apply to specified electronics products sold in the european union as of july  under the restriction of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment directive 
other countries  such as the united states  china and japan  have enacted or may enact laws or regulations similar to the eu legislation 
other environmental regulations may require us to re engineer our products to utilize components that are more environmentally compatible 
such re engineering and component substitution may result in excess inventory or other additional costs and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

table of contents in addition to the costs of complying with environmental  health and safety requirements  we may in the future incur costs defending against environmental litigation brought by government agencies and private parties 
we may be defendants in lawsuits brought by parties in the future alleging environmental damage  personal injury or property damage 
a significant judgment against us could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in the last few years  there has been increased media scrutiny and associated reports focusing on a potential link between working in semiconductor manufacturing clean room environments and certain illnesses  primarily different types of cancers 
regulatory agencies and industry associations have begun to study the issue to see if any actual correlation exists 
because we utilize clean rooms  we may become subject to liability claims 
in addition  these reports may also affect our ability to recruit and retain employees 
we cannot predict changes in environmental or health and safety laws or regulations  the manner in which environmental or health and safety laws or regulations will be enforced  administered or interpreted  our ability to enforce and collect under indemnity agreements and insurance policies relating to environmental liabilities  or the cost of compliance with future environmental or health and safety laws or regulations or the costs associated with any future environmental claims  including the cost of clean up of currently unknown environmental conditions 
new regulations related to conflict minerals may force us to incur additional expenses  may make our supply chain more complex and may result in damage to our reputation with customers 
pursuant to the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of  or the dodd frank act  the sec has adopted new requirements for companies that use certain minerals and metals  known as conflict minerals  in their products  whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties 
these requirements will require companies to diligence  disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries 
the implementation of these new requirements could adversely affect the sourcing  availability and pricing of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices  including our products 
in addition  we will incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements  including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals and metals used in our products 
since our supply chain is complex  we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins for these minerals and metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement  which may harm our reputation 
in such event  we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who require that all of the components of our products are certified as conflict mineral free 
we rely on third party distributors and manufacturers representatives  as well as our employee sales representatives  and the failure of these distributors or representatives to perform as expected could reduce our future sales 
in addition to selling products through our employee sales representatives  we also rely on distributors and manufacturers representatives to sell our products to our customers 
this is particularly the case in markets where we do not have a significant physical presence and new markets that we are seeking to enter 
we are unable to predict the extent to which our distributors and manufacturers representatives will be successful in marketing and selling our products 
moreover  many of our distributors and manufacturers representatives also market and sell competing products 
our relationships with our representatives and distributors may be terminated by either party at any time 
our future performance will depend  in part  on our ability to attract additional distributors or manufacturers representatives that will be able to market and support our products effectively  especially in markets where we have not previously distributed our products  and on our ability to effectively manage distribution efforts by our remaining global  full line distributors 
if we cannot retain our current distributors or manufacturers representatives  recruit additional or replacement distributors or manufacturers representatives  or effectively manage changes to our sales and distributions strategies  our sales and operating results will be harmed 
the average selling prices of products in our markets have historically decreased rapidly and will likely do so in the future  which could harm our revenues and gross profits 
the products we develop and sell are used for high volume applications 
as a result  the prices of those products have historically decreased rapidly 
gross profits on our products may be negatively affected by  among other things  pricing pressures from our customers  and the proportion of sales of our wireless and other products into consumer application markets  which are highly competitive and cost sensitive 
in the past  we have reduced the average selling prices of our products in anticipation of future competitive pricing pressures  new product introductions by us or our competitors and other factors 
in addition  some of our customer agreements provide for volume based pricing and product pricing roadmaps  which can also reduce the average selling prices of our products over time 
our gross profits and financial results will suffer if we are 
table of contents unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes  reducing manufacturing costs  or developing new and higher value added products on a timely basis 
we are required to assess our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis and any adverse findings from such assessment could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports  significant expenses to remediate any internal control deficiencies and ultimately have an adverse effect on our share price 
we are required to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually  as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act 
even though  as at october   we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective  we need to maintain our processes and systems and adapt them as our business grows and changes 
this continuous process of maintaining and adapting our internal controls and complying with section is expensive  time consuming and requires significant management attention 
we cannot be certain that our internal control measures will continue to provide adequate control over our financial processes and reporting and ensure compliance with section furthermore  as we grow our business or acquire other businesses  our internal controls may become more complex and we may require significantly more resources to ensure they remain effective 
failure to implement required new or improved controls  or difficulties encountered in their implementation  either in our existing business or in businesses that we may acquire  could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations 
if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify material weaknesses in our internal controls  the disclosure of that fact  even if quickly remedied  may cause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements and the trading price of our ordinary shares may decline 
remediation of a material weakness could require us to incur significant expense and if we fail to remedy any material weakness  our financial statements may be inaccurate  our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected  our access to the capital markets may be restricted  the trading price of our ordinary shares may decline  and we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities  including the sec or the nasdaq global select market 
we may also be required to restate our financial statements from prior periods 
a breach of our security systems may have a material adverse effect on our business 
our security systems are designed to maintain the physical security of our facilities and protect our customers  suppliers and employees confidential information 
however  we are also dependent on a number of third party cloud based service providers of critical corporate infrastructure services relating to  among other things  human resources  electronic communication services and certain finance functions  and we are  of necessity  dependent on the security systems of these providers 
accidental or willful security breaches or other unauthorized access by third parties to our facilities  our information systems or the systems of our cloud based service providers or the existence of computer viruses in our or their data or software could expose us to a risk of information loss and misappropriation of proprietary and confidential information 
any theft or misuse of such information could result in  among other things  unfavorable publicity  damage to our reputation  difficulty in marketing our products  allegations by our customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations  litigation by affected parties and possible financial obligations for liabilities and damages related to the theft or misuse of such information  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  profitability and financial condition 
since the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and are often not recognized until launched against a target  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures 
risks relating to investments in singapore companies it may be difficult to enforce a judgment of us courts for civil liabilities under us federal securities laws against us  our directors or officers in singapore 
we are incorporated under the laws of the republic of singapore  and certain of our officers and directors are resident outside the united states 
moreover  a majority of our consolidated assets are located outside the united states 
although we are incorporated outside the united states  we have agreed to accept service of process in the united states through our agent designated for that purpose 
nevertheless  since a majority of the consolidated assets owned by us are located outside the united states  any judgment obtained in the united states against us may not be collectible within the united states 
there is no treaty between the united states and singapore providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters and a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the united states based on civil liability  whether or not predicated solely upon the federal securities laws  would  therefore  not be automatically enforceable in singapore 
there is doubt whether a singapore court may impose civil liability on us or our directors and officers who reside in singapore in a suit brought in the singapore courts against us or such persons with respect to a violation solely of the federal securities laws of the united states  unless the facts surrounding such a violation would constitute or give rise to a cause of action under singapore law 
consequently  it may be difficult for investors to enforce 
table of contents against us  our directors or our officers in singapore judgments obtained in the united states  which are predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the united states 
we are incorporated in singapore and our shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interest than they would as shareholders of a corporation incorporated in the united states  and we may have more difficulty attracting and retaining qualified board members and executives 
our corporate affairs are governed by our memorandum and articles of association and by the laws governing corporations incorporated in singapore 
the rights of our shareholders and the responsibilities of the members of our board of directors under singapore law are different from those applicable to a corporation incorporated in the united states 
therefore  our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interest in connection with actions taken by our management or members of our board of directors than they would as shareholders of a corporation incorporated in the united states 
in addition  being a public company incorporated in singapore may make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
these factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors  particularly to serve on committees of our board  and qualified executive officers 
for a limited period of time  our directors have general authority to allot and issue new ordinary shares on terms and conditions as may be determined by our board of directors in its sole discretion 
under singapore law  we may only allot and issue new ordinary shares with the prior approval of our shareholders in a general meeting 
at our agm  our shareholders provided our directors with the general authority to allot and issue any number of new ordinary shares until the earlier of i the conclusion of our agm  ii the expiration of the period within which the next annual general meeting is required to be held ie  within months from the conclusion of the last general meeting or iii the subsequent revocation or modification of such general authority by our shareholders acting at a duly noticed and convened meeting 
subject to the general authority to allot and issue new ordinary shares provided by our shareholders  the provisions of the singapore companies act and our memorandum and articles of association  our board of directors may allot and issue new ordinary shares on terms and conditions as they may think fit to impose 
any additional issuances of new ordinary shares by our directors may adversely impact the market price of our ordinary shares 
risks relating to owning our ordinary shares at times  our share price has been volatile and it may fluctuate substantially in the future  which could result in substantial losses for our investors 
the trading price of our ordinary shares has  at times  fluctuated significantly 
the trading price of our ordinary shares could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many risk factors listed in this risk factors section  and others  many of which are beyond our control  including actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results  issuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts  fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us  announcement of  or expectation of additional financing efforts  sales of our ordinary shares by us or our shareholders  share price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares  and changes in our dividend policy 
these fluctuations are often unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance 
these broad market and industry fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions such as recessions  interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations  may negatively impact the market price of our ordinary shares 
you may not realize any return on your investment in us and may lose some or all of your investment 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation 
we may be the target of this type of litigation in the future 
securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention from other business concerns  which could seriously harm our business 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase shares 
our board adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which the company will pay quarterly dividends on our ordinary shares and our board has also re approved a program authorizing management to repurchase up to million of the company s ordinary shares  in their discretion  which authorization will expire at our agm 
the declaration and payment of any 
table of contents future dividend is subject to the approval of our board and our dividend policy could change at any time 
similarly  our share repurchase program may be suspended from time to time or terminated at any time prior to its expiration at the agm 
there can be no assurance that we will declare cash dividends or repurchase shares in the future in any particular amounts  or at all 
furthermore  we may declare dividends as interim dividends  which are wholly provisional under singapore law and may be revoked by our board at any time prior to the payment thereof 
the payment of cash dividends is restricted by applicable law and our corporate structure 
pursuant to singapore law and our articles of association  no dividends may be paid except out of our profits 
also  because we are a holding company  our ability to pay cash dividends on our ordinary shares and to repurchase our shares may be limited by restrictions on our ability to obtain sufficient funds through dividends from subsidiaries  including restrictions under the terms of our credit agreement 
future dividends and share repurchases  if any  their timing and amount  as well as the relative allocation of cash between dividends and share repurchases  may be affected by  among other factors our views on potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions  including acquisitions  earnings levels  contractual restrictions  cash position and overall financial condition  and changes to our business model 
in addition  the amount we spend and the number of shares we are able to repurchase under our share repurchase program may further be affected by a number of other factors  including the share price and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares 
a reduction in  or elimination of  our dividend payments and or share repurchases could have a negative effect on our share price 
singapore corporate law may impede a takeover of our company by a third party  which could adversely affect the value of our ordinary shares 
the singapore code on take overs and mergers contains provisions that may delay  deter or prevent a future takeover or change in control of our company for so long as we remain a public company with more than shareholders and net tangible assets of s million or more 
any person acquiring an interest  whether by a series of transactions over a period of time or not  either on their own or together with parties acting in concert with such person  in or more of our voting shares  or  if such person holds  either on their own or together with parties acting in concert with such person  between and both inclusive of our voting shares  and such person or parties acting in concert with such person acquires additional voting shares representing more than of our voting shares in any six month period  must  except with the consent of the securities industry council in singapore  extend a mandatory takeover offer for the remaining voting shares in accordance with the provisions of the singapore code on take overs and mergers 
while the singapore code on take overs and mergers seeks to ensure equality of treatment among shareholders  its provisions may discourage or prevent certain types of transactions involving an actual or threatened change of control of our company 
these legal requirements may impede or delay a takeover of our company by a third party  which could adversely affect the value of our ordinary shares 
our actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance 
from time to time  we release guidance regarding our future performance that represents our management s estimates as of the date of release 
this guidance  which consists of forward looking statements  is prepared by our management and is qualified by  and subject to  the assumptions and the other information contained or referred to in the release 
our guidance is not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the american institute of certified public accountants  and neither our independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles or examines the guidance and  accordingly  no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto 
guidance is based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that  while presented with numerical specificity  is inherently subject to significant business  economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies  many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions  some of which will change 
we generally state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed but are not intended to represent that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges 
the principal reason that we release this data is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors 
we do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such persons 
guidance is necessarily speculative in nature  and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions of the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results 
accordingly  our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release 
actual results will vary from the guidance and the variations may be material 
investors should also recognize that the reliability of any forecasted financial data diminishes the farther in the future that the data is forecast 
in light of the foregoing  investors are urged to put the guidance in context and not to place undue reliance on it 
any failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the events or circumstances set forth in this annual report on form k could result in the actual operating results being different than the guidance  and such differences may be adverse and material

these claims generally involve the demand by a third party that we cease the manufacture  use or sale of the allegedly infringing products  processes or technologies and or pay substantial damages or royalties for past  present and future use of the allegedly infringing intellectual property 
claims that our products or processes infringe or misappropriate any third party intellectual property rights including claims arising through our contractual indemnification of our customers often involve highly complex  technical issues  the outcome of which is inherently uncertain 
moreover  from time to time we pursue litigation to assert our intellectual property rights 
regardless of the merit or resolution of any such litigation  complex intellectual property litigation is generally costly and diverts the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel

the increase from fiscal year is primarily attributable to an increase in worldwide income and a change in the jurisdictional mix of income and expense 
provision for income taxes for fiscal year included a million tax benefit from the write up of deferred tax assets from us legislation retroactively reinstating the research and development tax credit and a million tax benefit from a change in estimate related to research and development tax credits 
in fiscal year  we recorded an income tax benefit totaling million 
the income tax benefit is associated with the release of million of deferred tax asset valuation allowances  mainly associated with the company irrevocably calling our senior subordinated notes for redemption in october  partially offset by the write off of million of deferred tax assets resulting from the grant of malaysia tax incentive status  and an increase in overall tax provision due to an increase in worldwide taxable income

overview we are a leading designer  developer and global supplier of a broad range of analog semiconductor devices with a focus on iii v based products 
iii v semiconductor materials have higher electrical conductivity and thus tend to have better performance characteristics in radio frequency  or rf  and optoelectronic applications than silicon 
we differentiate ourselves through our high performance design and integration capabilities 
we serve three primary target markets  with our wireless communications  wired infrastructure and industrial and automotive electronics target markets accounting for the substantial majority of our revenues 
our product portfolio is extensive and includes thousands of products 
applications for our products in these target markets include cellular phones  consumer appliances  data networking and telecommunications equipment  enterprise storage and servers  factory automation and displays 
until recently  we also sold products into the consumer and computing peripherals target market  which has historically represented a small portion of our total net revenue 
however  as this became a mature and non strategic market for us  during fiscal year we transitioned from developing  manufacturing and selling products into this target market to selling or licensing our intellectual property relevant to this target market  thereby generating royalty revenue instead of product sales revenue 
we completed this transition in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended october  or fiscal year we have a year history of innovation  dating back to our origins within hewlett packard company 
over the years  we have assembled a large team of analog design engineers  and we maintain design and product development engineering resources around the world 
our locations include two design centers in the united states  five in asia and four in europe 
we have developed an extensive portfolio of intellectual property that currently includes over  us and foreign patents and patent applications 
our history and market position enable us to strategically focus our research and development resources to address attractive target markets 
we leverage our significant intellectual property portfolio to integrate multiple technologies and create component solutions that target growth opportunities 
we design products that deliver high performance and provide mission critical functionality 
in particular  we were among the first to deliver commercial film bulk acoustic resonator  or fbar  filters which offer technological advantages over competing filters for smartphones to function more efficiently in today s congested rf spectrum 
fbar technology has historically maintained a significant market share within code division multiple access  or cdma  and g w cdma markets 
as cellular carriers move to the g long term evolution  or lte standard worldwide  we believe these advantages will continue to facilitate rapid adoption of fbar technology throughout the mobile phone ecosystems 
in optical solutions  we were a pioneer in commercializing vertical cavity surface emitting laser  or vcsel 
our fiber optic products and our vcsel based products  including high bandwidth parallel optic transceivers and modules  have been widely adopted throughout the wired infrastructure and computing industries 
in optoelectronics  we are a market leader in submarkets such as optocouplers and optical encoders 
we have a diversified and well established customer base of over  end customers  located throughout the world  which we serve through our multi channel sales and fulfillment system 
however  original equipment manufacturers  or oems  and distributors typically account for the substantial majority of our sales 
we have established strong relationships with leading oem customers across multiple target markets 
many of our major customer relationships have been in place multiple years and we have supplied multiple products during that time period 
our close customer relationships have often been built as a result of years of collaborative product development which has enabled us to build our intellectual property portfolio and develop critical expertise regarding our customer s requirements  including substantial system level knowledge 
this collaboration has provided us with key insights into our customers and has enabled us to be more efficient and productive and to better serve our target markets and customers 
we distribute most of our products through our broad distribution network  and a significant portion of our sales are to two of the largest global electronic components distributors  avnet  inc and arrow electronics  inc we also have a direct sales force focused on supporting large oems 
we focus on maintaining an efficient global supply chain and a variable  low cost operating model 
accordingly  we have outsourced a majority of our manufacturing operations utilizing third party foundry and assembly and test capabilities  as well as most of our corporate infrastructure functions 
we aim to minimize capital expenditures by focusing our internal manufacturing capacity on products utilizing our innovative materials and processes to protect our intellectual property and to develop the technology for manufacturing  while outsourcing standard complementary metal oxide semiconductor  or cmos  processes 
we also have over years of operating history in asia  where approximately of our employees are located and 
table of contents where we produce and source the majority of our products 
our presence in asia places us in close proximity to many of our customers manufacturing facilities and at the center of worldwide electronics manufacturing 
our business is impacted by general conditions of the semiconductor industry and seasonal demand patterns in our target markets 
we believe that our focus on multiple target markets and geographies helps mitigate our exposure to volatility in any single target market 
erosion of average selling prices of established products is typical of the semiconductor industry 
consistent with trends in the industry  we anticipate that average selling prices will continue to decline in the future 
however  as part of our normal course of business  we plan to offset declining average selling prices with efforts to reduce manufacturing costs of existing products and the introduction of new and higher value added products 
historically  a relatively small number of customers have accounted for a significant portion of our net revenue 
sales to distributors accounted for and of our net revenue for the years ended october  and october   respectively 
during the fiscal year ended october   foxconn technology group accounted for of our net revenue  and our top customers  which included three distributors  collectively accounted for of our net revenue 
during the fiscal year ended october   our top customers  which included three distributors  collectively accounted for of our net revenue 
no customer accounted for or more of our net revenue during the fiscal year ended october  we expect to continue to experience significant customer concentration in future periods 
the loss of  or significant decrease in demand from  any of our top ten customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operation and financial condition 
the demand for our products has been affected in the past  and is likely to continue to be affected in the future  by various factors  including the following general economic and market conditions in the semiconductor industry and in our target markets  our ability to specify  develop or acquire  complete  introduce and market new products and technologies in a cost effective and timely manner  the timing  rescheduling or cancellation of expected customer orders and our ability to manage inventory  the rate at which our present and future customers and end users adopt our products and technologies in our target markets  and the qualification  availability and pricing of competing products and technologies and the resulting effects on sales and pricing of our products 
current uncertainty in global economic conditions  including the ongoing sovereign debt crisis in europe and the potential fiscal cliff in the united states  still poses significant risks to our business 
for example  customers may defer purchases in response to tighter credit and negative financial news  which would in turn negatively affect product demand and our results of operations 
net revenue substantially all of our net revenue is derived from sales of semiconductor devices which our customers incorporate into electronic products 
we serve three primary target markets 
our wireless communications  wired infrastructure and industrial and automotive electronics account for the substantial majority of our revenues 
applications for our products in these target markets include cellular phones  consumer appliances  data networking and telecommunications equipment  enterprise storage and servers  factory automation and displays 
we sell our products primarily through our direct sales force  although we also use manufacturers representatives in particular geographic areas and may use them for new customers 
we also use distributors for a portion of our business and recognize revenue upon delivery of product to the distributors 
such revenue is reduced for estimated returns and distributor allowances 
our legacy consumer and computing peripherals target market historically represented a small portion of our total net revenue 
as this became a mature and non strategic market for us  during the fiscal year ended october  or fiscal year  we transitioned from manufacturing and selling products to selling and licensing intellectual property relevant to this market  which was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year as a result of this transition  we now generate royalty revenue instead of product sales from this target market  and due to the structure of these licensing arrangements royalty revenue may fluctuate from period to period 
beginning with the fiscal year ending november   or fiscal year  we will cease to separately present or discuss revenues from the consumer and computing peripherals target market 
instead  they will be combined with revenues from our industrial and automotive electronics target market  which will be referred to as our industrial and other target market 
costs and expenses total cost of products sold 
cost of products sold consists primarily of the cost of semiconductor wafers and other materials  and the cost of assembly and test 
cost of products sold also includes personnel costs and overhead related to our 
table of contents manufacturing operations  including share based compensation  and related occupancy  computer services and equipment costs  manufacturing quality  order fulfillment  warranty and inventory adjustments  including write downs for inventory obsolescence  energy costs and other manufacturing expenses 
total cost of products sold also includes amortization of intangible assets and restructuring charges 
although we outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing activities  we do retain some semiconductor fabrication and assembly and test facilities 
if we are unable to utilize our owned fabrication and assembly and test facilities at a desired level  the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed  resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross margins 
research and development 
research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs for our engineers engaged in the design and development of our products and technologies  including share based compensation expense 
these expenses also include project material costs  third party fees paid to consultants  prototype development expenses  allocated facilities costs and other corporate expenses and computer services costs related to supporting computer tools used in the engineering and design process 
selling  general and administrative 
selling expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for sales and marketing personnel  including share based compensation expense  sales commissions paid to our independent sales representatives  costs of advertising  trade shows  corporate marketing  promotion  travel related to our sales and marketing operations  related occupancy and equipment costs and other marketing costs 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for executive management  finance  human resources and other administrative personnel  outside professional fees  allocated facilities costs and other corporate expenses 
amortization of intangible assets 
in connection with acquisitions  we recorded intangible assets that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of six months to years 
in connection with these acquisitions  we also recorded goodwill which is not being amortized 
interest expense 
substantially all of our historical interest expense was associated with our borrowings incurred in connection with the spg acquisition 
this debt had been eliminated as at december   principally through cash flows from operations and net proceeds from our initial public offering  or ipo 
on march   we terminated our senior secured revolving credit facility  and avago technologies finance pte 
ltd  or avago finance  and certain other subsidiaries of the company entered into a new credit agreement which initially provided for a million unsecured revolving credit facility 
on august   avago finance exercised the accordion feature under this credit agreement to increase the aggregate commitments for its unsecured revolving credit facility from million to million 
interest expense in fiscal year included commitment fees under our current revolving credit facility and amortization of debt issuance costs associated with this credit facility 
loss on extinguishment of debt 
in connection with the repurchase or redemption of our outstanding indebtedness  we incurred a loss on the extinguishment of debt 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net includes interest income  currency gains losses on balance sheet remeasurement and other miscellaneous items 
provision for benefit from income taxes 
we have structured our operations to maximize the benefit from various tax incentives and tax holidays extended to us in various jurisdictions to encourage investment or employment 
for example  we have obtained several tax incentives from the singapore economic development board  an agency of the government of singapore  which provide that certain classes of income we earn in singapore are subject to tax holidays or reduced rates of singapore income tax 
each such tax incentive is separate and distinct from the others  and may be granted  withheld  extended  modified  truncated  complied with or terminated independently without any effect on the other incentives 
in order to retain these tax benefits in singapore  we must meet certain operating conditions specific to each incentive relating to  among other things  maintenance of a treasury function  a corporate headquarters function  specified intellectual property activities and specified manufacturing activities in singapore 
some of these operating conditions are subject to phase in periods through the singapore tax incentives are presently scheduled to expire at various dates generally between and  subject in certain cases to potential extensions 
absent such tax incentives  the corporate income tax rate in singapore that would otherwise apply to us would be 
for the fiscal years ended october   october   and october   the effect of all these tax incentives  in the aggregate  was to reduce the overall provision for benefit from income taxes from what it otherwise would have been in such year by approximately million  million and million  respectively 
in february  the malaysian government granted us a tax holiday on our qualifying malaysian income  which is effective for years beginning with our fiscal year the tax incentives that we have negotiated in malaysia and other jurisdictions are also subject to our compliance with various operating and other conditions 
if we cannot  or elect not to  comply with the operating conditions included in any particular tax incentive  we will lose the related tax benefits and could be required to refund material tax benefits previously realized by us with respect to that incentive and  depending on the incentive at issue  could likely be required to modify our operational structure and tax strategy 
any such modified structure may not be as 
table of contents beneficial to us from an income tax expense or operational perspective as the benefits provided under the present tax concession arrangements 
as a result of the tax incentives and tax holidays  if we continue to comply with the operating conditions  we expect the income from our operations to be subject to relatively lower income taxes than would otherwise be the case under ordinary income tax rules 
our interpretations and conclusions regarding the tax incentives are not binding on any taxing authority  and if our assumptions about tax and other laws are incorrect or if these tax incentives are substantially modified or rescinded we could suffer material adverse tax and other financial consequences  which would increase our expenses  reduce our profitability and adversely affect our cash flows 
in addition  taxable income in any jurisdiction is dependent upon acceptance of our operational practices and intercompany transfer pricing by local tax authorities as being on an arm s length basis 
due to inconsistencies in application of the arm s length standard among taxing authorities  as well as lack of adequate treaty based protection  transfer pricing challenges by tax authorities could  if successful  substantially increase our income tax expense 
going forward  our effective tax rate will vary based on a variety of factors  including overall profitability  the geographical mix of income before income taxes and the related tax rates in the jurisdictions where we operate  as well as discrete events  such as settlements of future audits 
in particular  we may owe significant taxes in jurisdictions outside singapore during periods when we are profitable in those jurisdictions even though we may be experiencing low operating profit or operating losses on a consolidated basis  potentially resulting in significant tax liabilities on a consolidated basis during those periods 
our historical provision for benefit from income taxes are not necessarily reflective of our future results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or gaap  requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts  historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from our estimates 
our critical accounting policies are those that affect our historical financial statements materially and involve difficult  subjective or complex judgments by management 
those policies include revenue recognition  valuation of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill  inventory valuation and warranty reserves  accounting for income taxes  retirement and post retirement benefit plan assumptions  and share based compensation 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue related to sales of our products  net of sales returns and allowances  provided that i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the price is fixed or determinable and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer 
we consider the price to be fixed or determinable when the price is not subject to refund or adjustments or when any such adjustments can be estimated 
we evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers to determine that appropriate credit limits are established prior to the acceptance of an order 
revenue  including sales to resellers and distributors  is reduced for estimated returns and distributor allowances 
we recognize revenue from sales of our products to distributors upon delivery of product to the distributors 
an allowance for distributor credits covering price adjustments and scrap allowances is made based on our estimate of historical experience rates as well as considering economic conditions and contractual terms 
to date  actual distributor claims activity has been materially consistent with the provisions we have made based on our historical estimates 
however  because of the inherent nature of estimates  there is always a risk that there could be significant differences between actual amounts and our estimates 
different judgments or estimates could result in variances that might be significant to reported operating results 
we enter into development agreements with some of our customers and recognize revenue from these agreements upon completion and acceptance by the customer of contract deliverables or milestones or as services are provided  depending on the terms of the arrangement 
revenue is deferred for any amounts billed or received prior to completion of milestones or delivery of services 
as we retain the intellectual property generated from these development agreements  costs related to these arrangements are included in research and development expense 
we recognize revenue from the licensing of our intellectual property when the following fundamental criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the sales price is fixed or determinable  and iv collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured 
revenue from upfront payments for the licensing of our patents is recognized when the arrangement is mutually signed  if there is no future delivery or future performance obligation and all other criteria are met 
revenue from guaranteed royalty streams are recognized when paid  or collection is reasonably assured and all other criteria are met 
when patent licensing arrangements include royalties for future sales of the licensees products 
table of contents using our licensed patented technology  revenue is recognized when the royalty report is received from the licensee  at which time the sales price is fixed and determinable  provided that all other criteria have been met 
valuation of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important  and which could trigger an impairment review of our long lived and intangible assets  include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
an impairment loss must be measured if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and before interest from the use of the asset is less than the net book value of the asset 
the amount of the impairment loss will generally be measured as the difference between the net book value of the asset or asset group and its their estimated fair value 
we perform an annual impairment review of our goodwill during the fourth fiscal quarter of each year  and more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist  and we follow the two step approach in performing the impairment test in accordance with the accounting guidance on goodwill and other intangible assets 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit with the related carrying amount 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  the reporting unit s goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value  the second step of the test must be performed to measure the amount of the goodwill impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination  with the carrying amount of such goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment 
we have one reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing purposes which is based on the manner in which we operate our business and the nature of those operations  including consideration of how the chief operating decision maker  as defined in the accounting guidance on segment reporting  manages the business as a whole 
we operate as one semiconductor company with sales of semiconductors representing the only material source of revenue 
substantially all products offered incorporate analog functionality and are manufactured under similar manufacturing processes 
for fiscal year  we used the quoted market price of our ordinary shares to determine the fair value of our reporting unit  which is the company as a whole 
no impairment of goodwill was identified based on the annual impairment review during the fourth quarter of fiscal year a decline in the quoted market prices of our ordinary shares would not impact the result of our goodwill impairment assessment 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of long lived assets under the accounting guidance on property  plant and equipment such as our property  plant and equipment and other intangible assets is also highly subjective and requires significant judgment 
in order to estimate the fair value of long lived assets  we typically make various assumptions about the future prospects about our business or the part of our business that the long lived asset relates to  consider market factors specific to the business and estimate future cash flows to be generated by the business  which requires significant judgment as it is based on assumptions about market demand for our products over a number of future years 
based on these assumptions and estimates  we determine whether we need to take an impairment charge to reduce the value of the long lived asset stated on our balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as the real estate market  industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  changes in assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results 
inventory valuation and warranty reserves 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost of the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory  with cost being determined under the first in  first out method 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our forecast of product demand and production requirements 
demand for our products can fluctuate significantly from period to period 
a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product development and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  which may cause us to understate or overstate both the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory and cost of products sold 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our results of operations 
we establish reserves for estimated product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized 
although we engage in extensive product quality control programs and processes  our warranty obligation has been and may in the future be affected by product failure rates  product recalls  repair or field replacement costs and additional development costs incurred in correcting any product failure  as well as possible claims 
table of contents for consequential costs 
should actual product failure rates  use of materials or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  additional warranty reserves could be required 
in that event  our gross margins would be reduced 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with the accounting guidance on income taxes 
the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities  and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 
significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowances 
if we determine  in the future  a valuation allowance is required  such adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase tax expense in the period in which such determination is made 
conversely  if we determine  in the future  a valuation allowance exceeds our requirement  such adjustment to the deferred tax assets would decrease tax expense in the period in which such determination is made 
in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions  we accrue an income tax liability when such positions do not meet the more likely than not threshold for recognition 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions 
we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in singapore and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes and interest will be due 
if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the actual amount ultimately assessed  a further charge to expense would be required 
if the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities no longer exist 
the gross unrecognized tax benefit decreased by million during fiscal year to million as of october  from million as of october  the gross unrecognized tax benefit as of october  was million 
we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for benefit from income taxes line in the consolidated statement of operations 
accrued interest and penalties are included within the other long term liabilities line in the consolidated balance sheet 
as of october   october   and october   the combined amount of cumulative accrued interest and penalties was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
retirement and post retirement benefit plan assumptions 
retirement and post retirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business 
they represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation 
pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future retirement and post retirement benefit plan costs over the employees average expected future service to the company  based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions 
to estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations  we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of gaap 
one critical assumption is the discount rate used to calculate the estimated costs 
other important assumptions include the expected long term return on plan assets  the health care cost trend rate  expected future salary increases  expected future increases to benefit payments  expected retirement dates  employee turnover  retiree mortality rates  and portfolio composition 
we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 
the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the relevant measurement dates october  and october   for both us and us plans  in fiscal years and  respectively 
for fiscal years and  the us discount rates were based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a published pension discount curve 
the discount rate for non us plans was generally based on published rates for high quality corporate bonds 
lower discount rates increase present values of pension liability and subsequent year pension expense  higher discount rates decrease present values of pension liability and subsequent year pension expense 
the expected long term return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns 
plan assets are valued at fair value 
a one percent change in the estimated long term return on plan assets for assumptions set in would result in a million impact on non us pension expense for fiscal year we have no plan assets under our us plans 
the net periodic retirement and post retirement benefit costs recorded in consolidated statement of operations excluding curtailments and settlements were million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year 
table of contents share based compensation expense 
share based compensation expense consists of expense for stock options and restricted share units  or rsus  granted to both employees and non employees as well as expense associated with avago technologies limited employee share purchase plan  or espp  which was implemented in september for stock options granted after november   we recognize compensation expense based on the estimated grant date fair value method required under the authoritative guidance using black scholes valuation model with a straight line amortization method 
since the authoritative guidance requires that share based compensation expense be based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest  estimated share based compensation expense for such awards has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
changes in the estimated forfeiture rates can have a significant effect on share based compensation expense since the effect of adjusting the rate is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 
the weighted average assumptions utilized for our black scholes valuation model for options and employee share purchase rights granted during the fiscal years ended october   october  and october  are as follows options espp year ended year ended october  october  october  october  october  october  risk free interest rate dividend yield volatility expected term in years the dividend yields for the years ended october  and october  are based on the historical and expected dividend payouts as of the respective option grant dates 
for the year ended october   the dividend yield of zero is based on the fact that we did not intend to declare any cash dividends as of the respective option grant dates during that period 
expected volatility is based on the combination of historical volatility of guideline publicly traded companies over the period commensurate with the expected term of the options and the implied volatility of guideline publicly traded companies from traded options with a term of days or greater measured over the last three months 
the risk free interest rate is derived from the average us treasury strips rate during the period  which approximates the rate in effect at the time of grant 
our computation of expected term was based on other data  such as the data of peer companies and company specific attributes that we believe could affect employees exercise behavior 
in fiscal year  we began to grant rsus  which are equity awards that are granted with an exercise price equal to zero and represent the right to receive one of our ordinary shares per rsu immediately upon vesting 
we recognize compensation expense for rsus using the straight line amortization method based on the fair value of rsus on the date of grant 
the fair value of rsus is the closing market price of our ordinary shares on the date of grant  which is equal to their intrinsic value on the date of grant 
we also record share based compensation expense based on an estimate of the fair value of rights to purchase ordinary shares under the espp and recognize this share based compensation expense using the straight line amortization method 
employee bonus programs 
our employee bonus programs  which are overseen by our compensation committee  provide for variable compensation based on the attainment of overall corporate annual targets and functional performance metrics 
in the first fiscal quarter of the year  if management determines that it is probable that the targets and metrics will be achieved  the amounts can be reasonably estimated  a variable  proportional compensation accrual is recorded based on an assumed percent achievement of the targets and metrics 
the bonus payout levels can be greater if attainment of metrics and targets is greater than and a portion of the payouts may not occur if a minimum floor of performance is not achieved 
in subsequent quarters  we monitor and accrue for variable compensation expense based on our actual progress toward the achievement of the annual targets and metrics 
the actual achievement of target metrics at the end of the fiscal year  which is subject to approval by our compensation committee  may result in the actual variable compensation amounts being significantly higher or lower than the relevant estimated amounts accrued in earlier quarters  which would result in a corresponding adjustment in the fourth fiscal quarter 
fiscal year presentation we operate on a or week fiscal year which ends on the sunday closest to october each of fiscal years  and consisted of weeks

net revenue was  million for fiscal year  compared to  million for fiscal year  an increase of million or 
the slight increase in net revenue was primarily due to strength in our wireless communications target market  largely offset by weakness in our industrial target market 
net revenue from our consumer and computing peripherals target market remained relatively flat compared to fiscal year  benefiting from the last time purchases of product due to our transition from manufacturing and sales of products to an intellectual property licensing and royalty business model in this target market 
this transition was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year our three largest target markets  by revenue  are wireless communications  wired infrastructure and industrial and automotive electronics 
our legacy consumer and computing peripherals target market has typically represented a much smaller percentage of our overall net revenue 
the percentage of total net revenue generated by sales in each of our target markets varies from quarter to quarter  due largely to fluctuations in end market demand  including the effects of seasonality 
the first fiscal quarter is typically our lowest revenue and cash generating quarter due  in part  to holiday shutdowns at many oem customers and distributors  and the first half of the fiscal year tends to generate lower revenue than the second half 
however  typical seasonality and industry cyclicality may be overshadowed by other factors such as wider macroeconomic effects  timing of significant product transitions and launches by large oems and new product launches by our competitors 
in fiscal year  strength in the smartphone market and strong product ramps at certain of our oems in this market more than offset weakness in our net revenue from industrial target market caused by continued supply chain contraction 
weakness in industrial spending  in china in particular  also adversely impacted revenue from our industrial target market in fiscal year 
table of contents historically  a relatively small number of customers have accounted for a significant portion of our net revenue 
during the fiscal year ended october   foxconn technology group companies accounted for of our net revenue 
our top customers for fiscal year ended october   which included three distributors each  collectively accounted for of our net revenue 
however  we believe that aggregate sales of our products to certain of our customers exceeds the amount of our direct sales to them 
for example  we believe our aggregate sales to two oems  when direct sales are combined with indirect sales to them through the respective contract manufacturers that they utilize  each accounted for more than of our net revenues  for the fiscal year ended october  we expect to continue to experience significant customer concentration in future periods 
the loss of  or significant decrease in demand from  any of our top ten customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operation and financial condition

we experienced higher demand for our multi mode  multi band power amplifiers  in particular  as well as for our fbar duplexers in fiscal year demand for fbar duplexers in fiscal year also benefited from transitions by various cellular carriers to the g lte standard 
net revenue from our wired infrastructure target market remained relatively flat in fiscal year  compared with fiscal year during fiscal year  we saw strong growth from sales of our asics used in data center applications compared to fiscal year revenues from this target market for fiscal year also reflect an increase in development agreement and intellectual property licensing revenue of million 
however for fiscal year  these effects were substantially offset by a decrease in high performance computing hardware sales  as well as a pullback in sales of proprietary parallel optics at several of our large communications oem customers due to weak core routing spending with service providers 
net revenue from our industrial and automotive electronics target market decreased in fiscal year compared with fiscal year this decrease was due primarily to continued  and worse than expected  supply chain corrections and weakness in industrial spending  in china in particular  in fiscal year compared with fiscal year these effects were partially offset by increases in revenue from development agreements and the sale of certain of our intellectual property of approximately million  for fiscal year net revenue from our legacy consumer and computing peripherals target market increase slightly in fiscal year compared with fiscal year this was largely due to the last time purchases of product in the third quarter of fiscal year  resulting from our transition from manufacturing and sales of products to an intellectual property licensing and royalty business model in this target market 
the transition to the intellectual property licensing royalty model was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year during the fiscal year  we generated approximately million in intellectual property 
table of contents related revenue from this target market 
due to the structure of these licensing arrangements  royalty revenue may fluctuate from period to period 
gross margin 
gross margin was  million for fiscal year compared to  million for fiscal year  a decrease of million 
as a percentage of net revenue  gross margin decreased slightly to for fiscal year  compared to fiscal year the slight decrease in gross margin in fiscal year was driven by product mix  with a higher proportion of sales into our wireless communication target market compared to sales into our higher margin industrial and automotive electronics target market 
this mix effect was substantially offset by i an increase in revenue from development agreements and sales and licensing of intellectual property of million in fiscal year ii a million decrease in cost of products sold due to a revision in wafer cost allocation methodology during fiscal year  and iii a million decrease in depreciation expense during the fiscal year  resulting from a change in the duration of the useful lives of certain of our manufacturing equipment which occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal year during the fiscal quarter ended january   we revised our cost allocation methodology to fully burden with overhead costs the expense for wafers used in research and development projects that are processed through our internal fabrication facilities  or r d wafer cost allocation methodology 
research and development 
research and development expense was million for fiscal year  compared to million for fiscal year  an increase of million or 
as a percentage of net revenue  research and development expenses remained flat at for fiscal year  compared to fiscal year the majority of this increase  in absolute dollars  resulted from investments in our wired infrastructure and wireless communications solutions 
part of the increase was attributable to a million increase in research and development project consumables and services  million of which was due to the change in r d wafer cost allocation methodology  as discussed above under gross margin  which increased gross margin by a corresponding amount 
the overall dollar increase in research and development expense was also attributable to an million increase in depreciation expense related to capital expenditures supporting research and development efforts  a million increase in salaries and employee benefits expense  and a million increase in share based compensation expense attributable to grants of share based awards at higher fair market values and to our espp 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in accrued incentive compensation expense related to our employee bonus program  which is a variable expense related to our achievement of program performance metrics  and a million decrease in computer software expenses in fiscal year  compared to the fiscal year the overall dollar increase in research and development expense is also net of million in accrued reimbursements pursuant to research and development grants 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future  due to the increasing complexity and number of products we plan to develop 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense was million for the year ended october  compared to million for the year ended october   a decrease of million or 
as a percentage of net revenue  selling  general and administrative expense decreased slightly to for the year ended october  compared to for the year ended october  changes in components of selling  general and administrative expense for the fiscal year  compared to the fiscal year  consisted of a million decrease in legal expenses related to offensive litigation matters  a million decrease in accrued incentive compensation expense related to our performance based employee bonus program  a million decrease in external services related to consulting and it  a million decrease in depreciation expense  and a million decrease in salaries and wages expense  partially offset by a million increase in share based compensation expense attributable to grants of share based awards at higher fair market values and to our espp 
amortization of intangible assets 
total amortization of intangible assets incurred was million and million  respectively  for fiscal years and restructuring charges 
we incurred total restructuring charges of million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year  both predominantly representing employee termination costs 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for fiscal year  compared to million for fiscal year  which represents a decrease of million 
the decrease is primarily due to the redemption of the remaining million aggregate principal amount of our senior subordinated rate notes on december  loss on extinguishment of debt 
during fiscal year  we redeemed million aggregate principal amount of our senior subordinated notes 
the redemption of the senior subordinated notes resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of million 
during fiscal year  we also terminated our senior secured revolving credit facility 
there were no outstanding loan borrowings under this facility at the time of termination

net revenue was  million for fiscal year  compared to  million for fiscal year  an increase of million or 
net revenue increased during fiscal year primarily due to strength in our wired infrastructure target market  as well as strength in our wireless communications and industrial and automotive electronics target markets 
the year over year increase in net revenue was partially due to improved general economic conditions during the year  compared to fiscal year and also due to our introduction of a number of new  proprietary products  which helped us to grow net revenues substantially over the period

the launch of next generation smartphones at leading new and existing oem customers  which incorporate many of our proprietary products such as g and g radio frequency filters and power amplifiers drove revenue growth during fiscal year net revenue from our industrial and automotive electronics products increased in absolute dollars in fiscal year  compared with fiscal year  while remaining flat as a percentage of net revenue 
the increase in the fiscal year was due to particular strength in sales of optocouplers  industrial fiber optic transceivers and industrial motion encoders 
we continued to benefit from strong demand in renewable energy  smart power grid installations and transportation applications  in both developed economies and emerging economies such as china 
demand in our industrial market slowed towards the end of fiscal year as a result of slower economic growth in china and a slow down in the renewable energy sector 
we believe this has caused some ongoing inventory corrections in the supply chain in this target market 
the effects of this were particularly noticeable in demand for servo drives and inverters for renewable energy applications in europe and asia pacific towards the end of fiscal year net revenue from our wired infrastructure target market increased substantially  in absolute dollars and also increased as a percentage of net revenue  in fiscal year  compared with fiscal year spending on enterprise networking data centers  storage systems and core routing grew during the year 
in addition  we introduced a number of new fiber optic transceivers and asics in fiscal year  compared with fiscal year  which contributed to the increase in revenue 
the strong growth in sales of our asic products compared to fiscal year was due primarily to strength in next generation data center switching 
increase in revenue recognized on development contracts for future asic products in fiscal year  compared with fiscal year  also contributed to the increase in revenue 
net revenue from our consumer and computing peripheral target market decreased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal year  compared with fiscal year this reflected a decline in sales of optical sensors used in optical mice and sales of motion encoders used in applications such as optical disc drives and printers in fiscal year net revenue from this target market during this period was also affected by ongoing softness in the personal computer and printer market 
gross margin 
gross margin was  million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year  an increase of million or 
as a percentage of net revenue  gross margin increased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year the increase in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to continuing improvements in product mix 
during fiscal year  compared fiscal year  a higher proportion of our net revenues were from products sold into the wired infrastructure target market and from sales of our proprietary products  which generally earn higher gross margins than our other products  partially offset by continued strong sales of our wireless products and changes in the mix of our wireless products

liquidity and capital resources the following section discusses our principal liquidity and capital resources as well as our principal liquidity requirements and sources and uses of cash 
our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of days or less at the time of purchase 
we believe our cash equivalents are liquid and accessible 
the majority of our cash and cash equivalents are held in financial institutions in singapore 

table of contents our primary sources of liquidity as at october  consisted of approximately  million in cash and cash equivalents  cash we expect to generate from operations and our million revolving credit facility  which is committed until march   all of which is available to be drawn 
our short term and long term liquidity requirements primarily arise from i working capital requirements  ii research and development and capital expenditure needs  including acquisitions from time to time and iii quarterly dividend payments if and when declared by our board and any share repurchases we may choose to make under our share repurchase program 
our ability to fund these requirements will depend on our future cash flows  which are determined by future operating performance and are  therefore  subject to prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
in june  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of the company s outstanding ordinary shares  not to exceed million  in the aggregate  referred to as the share repurchase program  in open market transactions prior to our annual general meeting of the company  which was held on april  during the year ended october   we repurchased an aggregate of million shares for an aggregate purchase price of million  under the share repurchase program 
on april   our board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to million of its ordinary shares  referred to as the share repurchase program 
for the fiscal year ended october   the company repurchased million shares for an aggregate of purchase price of million in cash under the share repurchase program 
share repurchases under our share repurchase programs are made in the open market at such times and in such amounts as the company deems appropriate 
the timing and actual number of shares repurchased depend on a variety of factors including price  market conditions and applicable legal requirements 
the share repurchase program does not obligate the company to repurchase any specific number of shares and may be suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice 
the share repurchase program will expire at the company s agm  unless earlier terminated 
our cash and cash equivalents increased by million to  million at october  from million at october  primarily as a result of million in cash provided by operating activities and million in cash received from the issuance of ordinary shares pursuant to the exercise of options under our employee share option plans and purchase rights under our employee share purchase plan 
partially offsetting this increase were million cash paid for capital expenditures  million of cash paid to repurchase million of our ordinary shares  and million in dividends paid to our shareholders 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand  and cash flows from operations  combined with availability under our revolving credit facility  will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our current obligations  projected working capital requirements  capital spending  quarterly dividends if and when declared by our board and any share repurchases we may choose to make under our share repurchase program for at least the next months 
we anticipate that our capital expenditures for fiscal year may be incrementally higher than for fiscal year  due primarily to increased spending on capacity expansion in our fort collins internal fabrication facility  as well as spending on equipment to support various research and development projects 
if we do not have sufficient cash to fund our operations or finance growth opportunities  including acquisitions  or unanticipated capital expenditures  our business and financial condition could suffer 
we could also reduce certain expenditures such as repurchases of our ordinary shares and payment of our quarterly dividend 
in such circumstances we may seek to obtain debt or equity financing in the future 
however  we cannot assure that such additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
our ability to service any indebtedness we may incur  including under our revolving credit facility  will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
in addition  even though we may not need additional funds  we may still elect to sell additional debt or equity securities or increase our current credit facility for other reasons 
the following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated in millions year ended october  october  october  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net increase in cash and cash equivalents cash flows for the years ended october  and october  operating activities net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended october  was million 
the net cash provided by operating activities was principally due to net income of million and non cash charges of million  offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of million 

table of contents accounts receivable increased to million at the end of fiscal year from million at the end of fiscal year accounts receivable days sales outstanding increased to days at october  from days at october  primarily due to linearity of shipments in the last three months of fiscal year as compared to the last three months of fiscal year we use the current quarter revenue in our calculation of number of days sales outstanding 
inventory was million at both october  and october  inventory days on hand remained flat at days as of both october  and october  we use the current quarter cost of products sold in our calculation of days on hand of inventory 
other current assets increased to million at october  from million at the end of fiscal year primarily due to a million increase in cash advances made to certain of our existing distributors for anticipated distributor price adjustments  a million increase in receivables from our contract manufacturers for materials purchased by us on their behalf to secure pricing  a million increase in receivables from intellectual property related revenue  a million increase in receivables from government grants  a million increase in assets related to the employee deferred compensation plan and a million increase in deposits paid for fixed assets  partially offset by a million decrease in current deferred taxes  net of valuation allowances 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  we entered into agreements with certain distributors whereby we agreed to advance cash to them to fund estimated price adjustments 
these advances are estimated based on an agreed percentage of the rolling previous three months average ending inventory  as reported by the distributor  multiplied by the rolling previous three months price adjustment credits as a percentage of the distributor s reported rolling previous three months resales 
the terms of these advances are set forth in binding legal agreements and are unsecured  bear no interest on unsettled balances  and are due upon demand 
the agreements governing these advances can be cancelled by us at any time 
such advances have no impact on revenue recognition or our consolidated statements of operations and are recorded in other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
current liabilities decreased to million at the end of fiscal year from million at the end of fiscal year mainly due to a decrease in employee compensation and benefits accruals and other current liabilities  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable 
employee compensation and benefits decreased to million at the end of fiscal year from million at the end of fiscal year mainly due to performance levels under our employee bonus program related to our overall profitability and other performance metrics 
other current liabilities decreased to million at the end of fiscal year from million at the end of fiscal year primarily due to a million release from and million utilization of warranty accruals  a million decrease in supplier inventory liabilities and million recognition of previously deferred revenue  offset by a million increase in income tax and sales and use tax payables 
accounts payable increased to million as at october  from million at the end of fiscal year due to timing of disbursements and a higher volume of purchases to support the increase in revenue over the year 
other long term assets increased to million at the end of fiscal year from million at the end of fiscal year mainly due to the increase in long term deferred tax assets 
other long term liabilities increased to million at the end of fiscal year from million at the end of fiscal year mainly due to the change in actuarial assumptions used in the valuation of our post retirement benefit and defined benefit pension plans liabilities and the net periodic pension expenses recorded during the year for our post retirement benefit and defined benefit pension plans 
net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended october  was million 
the net cash provided by operating activities was principally due to net income of million and non cash charges of million  offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of million 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities for the year ended october  was million 
the net cash used in investing activities principally related to purchases of property  plant and equipment of million  in connection with the expansion of our internal manufacturing facilities in fort collins  colorado and million related to immaterial business acquisitions completed in fiscal year net cash used in investing activities for the year ended october  was million 
the net cash used in investing activities principally related to purchases of property  plant and equipment of million and million related to a business acquisition completed in fiscal year financing activities net cash used in financing activities for the year ended october  was million 
the net cash used in financing activities was principally due to an aggregate of million in payments of cash dividends to shareholders and the payment of an aggregate of million to repurchase and cancel million shares of our ordinary shares under our share repurchase program

indebtedness as of october   we had million of capital lease obligations 
at such date  we also had million of borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility 
revolving credit facility our current credit agreement provides for a million senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a term of four years  ending on march  the revolving credit facility is available for cash borrowings and for the issuance of letters of credit up to a sub limit of million 
the credit agreement contains financial covenants requiring avago finance to maintain a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio and customary restrictive covenants  including certain restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries including avago finance to pay dividends  and customary events of default 
in addition  the credit agreement permits avago finance to increase the aggregate commitments under the credit agreement from million to million  at any time  subject to certain conditions and the receipt of sufficient commitments for such increase from the lenders 
compliance with financial covenants is required for the term of the credit agreement irrespective of the amount of borrowing outstanding 
on august   avago finance exercised the accordion feature under its credit agreement to increase the aggregate commitments for its unsecured revolving credit facility from million to million 
this increase in the revolving credit facility commitment result in a corresponding increase in commitment fees payable under the credit agreement 
certain subsidiaries of the company guarantee the revolving credit facility 
borrowings under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility are subject to floating rates of interest and will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to base rate advances the highest of x citibank s publicly announced base rate from time to time  y the us federal funds rate plus and z the british bankers association interest settlement rate  or bba libor rate applicable to dollars for a period of one month plus  or eurocurrency advances the rate per annum obtained by dividing x the bba libor rate for deposits in dollars for the applicable interest period by y a percentage equal to minus the eurocurrency liabilities reserve percentage specified by the us federal reserve system for such interest period  plus  in each case  a margin based on the credit rating of avago finance s long term unsecured debt or avago finance s corporate credit rating  as applicable  or the avago public debt rating

as of october   we had no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility and were in compliance with the financial covenants under our credit agreement 
we did not draw on our revolving credit facility during fiscal year contractual commitments our cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors  including fluctuations in our operating results  accounts receivable collections  inventory management  and timing of payments 
as a result  the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors 

table of contents the following table sets forth our contractual obligations and commitments as of october  for the fiscal periods noted in millions total to to thereafter operating leases capital leases purchase commitments revolving credit facility commitments other contractual commitments includes operating lease commitments for facilities and equipment that we have entered into with third parties 
includes capital lease commitments for equipment that we have entered into with third parties 
we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products 
during the normal course of business  we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates 
however  our agreements with these suppliers usually allow us the option to cancel  reschedule  and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed 
typically purchase orders outstanding with delivery dates within days are non cancelable 
we also make purchases from a variety of vendors in connection with the expansion of our fort collins internal fabrication facility 
these purchases are typically conducted on a purchase order basis and the amount shown in the table includes million in cancelable and non cancelable outstanding purchase obligations under such purchase orders as of october  in addition to the above non cancelable purchase commitments  we record a liability for firm  non cancelable  and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts in conjunction with our write down of inventory 
as of october   the liability for our firm  non cancelable and unconditional purchase commitments related to inventory suppliers was million 
this amount is included in other current liabilities in our balance sheets at october   and are excluded from the preceding table 
represents commitment fees and letter of credit fees 
represents amounts payable pursuant to agreements related to outsourced it  human resources  financial infrastructure outsourcing services and other services agreements 
due to the inherent uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash outflows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at october   we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority 
therefore  million of unrecognized tax benefits classified as long term income tax payable in the consolidated balance sheet as of october  have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
off balance sheet arrangements we had no material off balance sheet arrangements at october  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
indemnifications to hewlett packard and agilent agilent technologies  inc has given multiple indemnities to hewlett packard company in connection with its activities prior to its spin off from hewlett packard company in june for the businesses that constituted agilent prior to the spin off 
as the successor to the spg business of agilent  we may acquire responsibility for indemnifications related to assigned intellectual property agreements 
additionally  when we completed the spg acquisition in december  we provided indemnities to agilent with regard to agilent s conduct of the spg business prior to the spg acquisition 
in our opinion  the fair value of these indemnifications is not material and no amount has been accrued in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to these indemnification obligations 
other indemnifications as is customary in our industry and as provided for in local law in the united states and other jurisdictions  many of our standard contracts provide remedies to our customers and others with whom we enter into contracts  such as defense  settlement  or payment of judgment for intellectual property claims related to the use of our products 
from time to time  we indemnify customers  as well as our suppliers  contractors  lessors  lessees  companies that purchase our businesses or assets 
table of contents and others with whom we enter into contracts  against combinations of loss  expense  or liability arising from various triggering events related to the sale and the use of our products  the use of their goods and services  the use of facilities and state of our owned facilities  the state of the assets and businesses that we sell and other matters covered by such contracts  usually up to a specified maximum amount 
in addition  from time to time we also provide protection to these parties against claims related to undiscovered liabilities  additional product liability or environmental obligations 
in our experience  claims made under such indemnifications are rare and the associated estimated fair value of the liability is not material

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency derivative instruments although a majority of our revenue and operating expenses is denominated in us dollars  and we prepare our financial statements in us dollars in accordance with gaap  a portion of our revenue and operating expenses is in foreign currencies 
our revenues  costs and expenses and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities 
to mitigate the exposures resulting from the changes in the exchange rates of these currencies  we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge a portion of these exposures 
contracts that meet accounting criteria are designated at inception as hedges of the related foreign currency exposures  which include committed and anticipated transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
the criteria for designating a derivative as a hedge include the assessment of the instrument s effectiveness in risk reduction  matching of the derivative instrument to its underlying transaction  and the assessment of the probability that the underlying transaction will occur 
our foreign exchange forward contracts generally mature within three to six months 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
as of october   there were no foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding 
losses from foreign currency transactions  as well as derivative instruments  are included in our consolidated statements of operations in the amounts of million  million and million for the years ended october   october  and october  interest rate risk borrowings under our revolving credit facility are subject to floating rates of interest 
any significant changes in interest rates would increase our borrowing costs under our credit facility 
however  a hypothetical increase of basis points in short term interest rates would not have a material impact on our revolving credit facility 
we did not have any borrowings outstanding under this facility during fiscal year or as at october  european debt exposures we actively monitor our exposure to the european financial markets  including the impact of sovereign debt issues 
we also mitigate our risk by investing in fixed deposits with various financial institutions and we limit the amount we hold with any one institution 
we do not have any direct investments in the sovereign debt of european countries 
from time to time  we may have deposits with major european financial institutions 
we also mitigate collection risks from our customers by performing regular credit evaluations of our customers financial conditions and require collateral  such as letters of credit and bank guarantees  in certain circumstances 
as of october   we do not believe that we have any material direct or indirect exposure to the european financial markets
