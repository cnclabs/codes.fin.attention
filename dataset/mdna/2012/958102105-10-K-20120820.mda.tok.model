thailand flooding we suspended production in all of our thailand manufacturing facilities during the week of october  due to severe flooding in thailand  where flood waters inundated our facilities and submerged certain equipment located there 
the flooded facilities in thailand included our magnetic head slider fabrication facilities  which supplied a substantial majority of our magnetic head requirements prior to the flooding 
the flooded facilities in thailand also included our hard drive  head gimbal assembly hga and head stack assembly hsa facilities 
in the march quarter of  we restarted hard drive production and recommenced slider production in thailand 
we also extended slider production capacity into malaysia and began shipping hard drives with sliders produced in malaysia in the june quarter 
we believe we now have the capability to adequately meet anticipated customer demand 
in  we recorded million of charges related to the flooding 
total charges included million of fixed asset impairments  million of recovery charges  million of write downs of damaged inventory and million in wage continuation during the shutdown period of our facilities  offset by million of insurance recoveries and other cost reimbursements

fiscal year compared to fiscal year net revenue 
net revenue was billion for  an increase of from operations from hgst contributed billion in net revenue 
total hard drive shipments in decreased to million units as compared to million units for the prior year 
the increase in net revenue resulted primarily from a increase in asp from to  partially offset by lower shipments 
these changes were as a result of the severe supply constraints across the hard drive industry brought about by the thailand floods 

table of contents changes in revenue by geography and channel generally reflect normal fluctuations in market demand and competitive dynamics 
however  during  changes in revenue by geography and channel reflected our efforts to allocate products to our customers as a result of the flooding in thailand by balancing their immediate needs with their prevailing inventory positions in order to maximize the availability of hard drive products to the end customer within the shortest time horizon 
in addition  as a result of our acquisition of hgst  our revenue by channel mix has become more heavily weighted toward oem 
in accordance with standard industry practice  we have sales incentive and marketing programs that provide customers with price protection and other incentives or reimbursements that are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue 
for  these programs represented of gross revenues compared to in this decrease was mainly driven by the severe supply constraints brought about by the thailand floods 
these amounts generally vary according to several factors including industry conditions  seasonal demand  competitor actions  channel mix and overall availability of product

in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded million of asset impairment charges  million of contract termination and other exit costs and million of employee termination benefits 
other income expense 
other expense  net was million in compared to million in interest expense increased from million in to million in  primarily due to interest on a higher debt balance and a million increase in debt commitment fees incurred prior to the closing of the acquisition  offset by million of gains on sales of our investments 
interest income increased from million in to million in due to higher average daily invested cash balances 
income tax provision 
income tax expense was million in as compared to million in tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes was in compared to for the differences between the effective tax rate and the us federal statutory rate are primarily due to tax holidays in malaysia  the philippines  singapore and thailand that expire at various dates through and the current year generation of income tax credits 
as of june   we had a recorded liability for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately million  which includes million assumed in the acquisition 
aside from the increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to liabilities assumed in the acquisition  we recognized a net decrease of million in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits during interest and penalties recognized on such amounts were not material 

table of contents the internal revenue service irs has completed its field examination of the federal income tax returns for fiscal years and for us and calendar years and for komag  incorporated komag  which was acquired by us on september  in september  we received a final revenue agent report rar and closing agreement with respect to the years under examination for komag 
this agreement resulted in an immaterial benefit to our income tax provision 
we have also received rars from the irs that seek adjustments to income before income taxes of approximately million in connection with unresolved issues related primarily to transfer pricing and certain other intercompany transactions 
we disagree with the proposed adjustments 
in may  we filed a protest with the irs appeals office regarding the proposed adjustments 
meetings with the appeals office began in february in january  the irs commenced an examination of our fiscal years and and komag s period ended september  we believe that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations 
however  the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty 
if any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management s expectations  we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs 
as of june   it is not possible to estimate the amount of change  if any  in the unrecognized tax benefits that is reasonably possible within the next twelve months 
any significant change in the amount of our unrecognized tax benefits would most likely result from additional information or settlements relating to the examination of our tax returns
