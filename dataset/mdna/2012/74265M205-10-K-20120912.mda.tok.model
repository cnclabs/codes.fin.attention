item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the company s results of operations and financial condition for the years ended june  and unless otherwise indicated  this discussion excludes the results of our fractional horsepower motor product line  operating under the name pro dex astromec  which we sold in february and which has been classified as a discontinued operation 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
this report contains certain forward looking statements and information 
the cautionary statements included below and elsewhere in this report should be read as being applicable to all related forward looking statements wherever they may appear 
our actual future results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
critical accounting estimates and judgments our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition revenue on product sales is recognized upon shipment to the customer when risk of loss and title transfer to the customer and all other conditions required by gaap  as promulgated by the financial accounting standards board fasb in accounting standards codification asc section formerly staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  have been satisfied 
returns of our product for credit are minimal  accordingly  we do not establish a reserve for product returns at the time of sale 
warranties certain of our products are sold with a warranty that provides for repairs or replacement of any defective parts for a period  generally one year  after the sale 
at the time of the sale  we accrue an estimate of the cost of providing the warranty based on prior experience with such factors as return rates and repair costs  which factors are reviewed quarterly 
warranty expenses  including changes of estimates  are included in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market value 
reductions to estimated market value are recorded  and charged to cost of sales  when indicated based on a formula that compares on hand quantities to estimated demand over the ensuing months from the measurement date 
accounts receivable trade receivables are stated at their original invoice amounts  less an allowance for doubtful portions of such accounts 
management determines the allowance for doubtful accounts based on facts and circumstances related to specific accounts  and on historical experience related to the age of accounts 
trade receivables are written off when deemed uncollectible 
recoveries of trade receivables previously reserved are offset against the allowance when received 
long lived assets and real estate held for sale we review the recoverability of long lived assets  consisting of equipment and leasehold improvements  and of real estate held for sale  when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate carrying values may not be recoverable 
stock based compensation we recognize compensation expense for all share based awards made to employees and directors 
the fair value of share based awards is estimated at the grant date using the black scholes option pricing model 
the portion that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as compensation cost over the requisite service period using the straight line single option method 

table of contents the determination of fair value using the black scholes model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables  including expected stock price volatility  risk free interest rate  expected dividends and projected employee stock option exercise behavior 
we estimate stock price volatility based on two factors a the measurement date typically the grant date and b the expected life of the option  which we calculate using the staff accounting bulletin no 
simplified method 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities along with net operating loss and tax credit carryovers 
deferred tax assets at june  and consisted primarily of basis differences related to research and development tax credit utilization  net operating loss carryovers  intangible assets  accrued expenses and inventories 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and the recoverability of our deferred tax assets 
such determination is based on our historical taxable income  with consideration given to our estimates of future taxable income and the periods over which deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to reduce the net carrying value to an amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
when we establish or reduce the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets  the provision for income taxes will increase or decrease  respectively  in the period such determination is made 
at june  and  we maintained a valuation allowance against the entire balance of our deferred tax assets  net of deferred tax liabilities 
results of operations results of operations for the fiscal year ended june   compared to the fiscal year ended june  the following table sets forth financial data and the percentage of net sales regarding our financial position and operating results fiscal year ended june  dollars in thousands net sales cost of sales gross profit selling expenses general and administrative expenses research and development costs income loss from continuing operations before items below interest expense provision benefit for income taxes income loss from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations net income loss net sales in decreased  or million  to million from million in  due primarily to a reduction of million in sales of our medical device products to our largest customer 

table of contents although selective price increases and decreases were implemented in response to market conditions  the majority of the sales growth and declines for each product line is due primarily to changes in sales volume  not the effect of price changes 
at june   we had a backlog of million compared with a backlog of million at june  the decrease in orders from our largest customer contributed to the backlog decrease  and million of the backlog decrease was due to a delay in the timing of orders from our second largest customer  which orders were placed with us in july gross profit in decreased million  or  to million from million in  resulting primarily from a million attributable to the sales volume decreases discussed above  b  related to product mix changes and c  attributable to manufacturing inefficiencies caused by the lower sales volume

our effective combined federal and state tax benefit rate in was  as compared to a tax provision rate in the benefit generated in is attributable to the net operating losses incurred 
the effective tax rates in both and were lower than the federal statutory rate primarily due to changes in net deferred tax credits not resulting in a deferred tax provision in  such changes being fully offset by corresponding changes in the valuation allowance against such net deferred tax debits see note of notes to consolidated financial statements

see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
our bank credit facility agreements contain various covenants  including certain covenants measured annually based on fiscal year results  concerning our financial performance 
at june   we were in violation of profitability based covenants  for which the bank had the right to declare us in default of the bank credit facility agreements and the entire amount owing under the facility  consisting of a term loan  to become immediately due and payable 
we have historically not made any borrowings against our bank lines of credit  and believe that existing cash balances and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund operations for the next twelve months and to fully repay the term loan 
accordingly  on august   we notified the bank of our intent to terminate the credit facility agreements and repay the term loan in full on or before september  by letter to us dated september   the bank waived  through october   the rights it otherwise would have had pursuant to the covenant violations described above 
accordingly  we have classified all amounts owing under the term loan as current liabilities as of june  in the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
reduction in large customer orders in december our largest customer informed us that it was in the process of developing  and planned to eventually manufacture  its own surgical devices which were functionally comparable to the products the company provided to the customer at that time 
pro dex had been the exclusive manufacturer of these products since they were developed 
the resulting reduction in orders from our largest customer and its expected future impact on our business is more fully described in description of business under item 
table of contents changes in bank debt and credit facilities union bank credit facility as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  during the fiscal year ended june   we effected the following changes in our bank debt and credit facility arrangements on february   we entered into a credit facility agreement with union bank that provides for a a revolving credit line of up to million  b a non revolving credit line of up to  for the purchase of equipment  and c a term loan of million 
the proceeds of the term loan were used to pay off in full the wells fargo term loan previously outstanding 
on september   we paid the remaining million balance due on a mortgage previously outstanding with union bank  fully retiring such indebtedness 
as discussed above in liquidity and capital resources under this item  on august  we informed the bank of our intent to repay the term loan in full and terminate the credit facility agreements 
by letter to us dated september   the bank waived  through october   the rights it otherwise would have had pursuant to the covenant violations described above 
impact of inflation and changing prices the industries in which we compete are labor intensive  often involving personnel with high level technical or sales skills 
wages and other expenses increase during periods of inflation and when shortages in the marketplace occur 
in addition  suppliers pass along rising costs to us in the form of higher prices 
we have been able to partially offset increases in operating costs by increasing charges  expanding services and implementing cost control measures 
however  our ability to increase prices is limited by competitive market conditions  including international competition in many of our markets 
recent accounting pronouncements we evaluate authoritative accounting pronouncements upon their issuance and estimate the effect  if any  of such pronouncements on our financial statements 
in our evaluation  we have concluded that there are no such pronouncements that have been issued with effective dates subsequent to june  that would have an effect on our financial statements or accounting policies had such pronouncements been currently in effect
