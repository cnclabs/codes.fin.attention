item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data  risk factors  forward looking statements and our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes and other data  all of which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
certain prior year information has been reclassified to conform to the current year s presentation 
overview we are a diversified leader in healthcare staffing services offering an extensive suite of staffing and outsourcing services to the healthcare market 
we report our financial results according to four business segments nurse and allied staffing  physician staffing  clinical trial services and other human capital management services 
we believe we are one of the top two providers of nurse and allied staffing services  one of the top four providers of temporary physician staffing locum tenens services  as well as a leading provider of clinical trial staffing services  retained physician search services and educational seminars specifically for the healthcare marketplace 
we have a diversified revenue mix across business sectors and healthcare customers 
for the year ended december   our nurse and allied staffing business segment represented approximately of our revenue and is comprised of travel nurse and per diem nurse staffing  and allied health staffing 
travel nurse staffing represented approximately of our total revenue and of our nurse and allied staffing business segment revenue 
other nurse and allied staffing services include the placement of per diem nurses and allied healthcare professionals  such as radiology technicians  rehabilitation therapists  nurse practitioners and respiratory therapists 
our physician staffing business segment represented approximately of revenue and consists of temporary physician staffing services locum tenens 
our clinical trial services business segment represented approximately of our revenue and consists of service offerings that include traditional contract staffing and functional outsourcing  as well as drug safety monitoring and regulatory services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers 
our other human capital management services business segment represented approximately of our revenue and consists of education and training and retained search services 
the long term macro drivers of our business are demographic in nature and consist of a growing and aging us population demanding more healthcare services and an aging workforce of healthcare professionals 
additionally  there are projected shortages of healthcare professionals including registered nurses rns and physicians 
we believe demand for our nurse  allied and physician services is primarily influenced by two factors national labor market dynamics that affect the number of hours worked by healthcare professionals and the strength or weakness in acute care hospital admissions relative to expectations and the volume of patients at medical facilities and physician offices 
demand for our clinical trial staffing services is primarily influenced by the level of research and development r d activities by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
during  demand improved for both our nurse and allied staffing services and our clinical trial services  and became more stable for our physician staffing services 
however  overall demand for our healthcare staffing services remains substantially reduced from levels prior to the economic downturn that began in the fall of the supply of healthcare professionals in the marketplace is dependent upon the number of rns and physicians entering their respective professions versus retiring from the workforce 
the supply of rns available for our staffing services is variable and influenced by current labor market dynamics  as well as dependent upon the desire of rns to work temporary assignments versus being directly employed by hospitals as staff nurses or working in non hospital settings such as insurance companies  health clinics and doctor offices 
the supply of physicians available for our physician staffing services is variable and is influenced by several factors  including the desire of physicians to work temporary assignments versus being in private practice or directly employed at healthcare facilities  the desire of older physicians to work fewer hours  work lifestyle balance among younger physicians  and the trend toward more female physicians in the workforce working fewer hours than male counter parts 
the supply of clinical trial personnel in the marketplace is relatively stable and comprised primarily of individuals with an educational background and experience in life sciences  as well as healthcare professionals who have left a care giving role to pursue clinical research opportunities 
the supply of qualified candidates available for our clinical trial services is dependent on the number of clinical trial professionals not currently employed in ongoing trials  as well as new qualified candidates entering the industry 
during  applicant activity in our nurse and allied staffing business increased significantly  while the number of physicians added to our physician staffing database and the number of new staffing candidates in our clinical trial services databases also increased from the prior year 
for the year ended december   our revenue was million  and we generated net income of million  or per diluted share 
during  we generated million in cash flow from operations and reduced our total debt by million 
we ended the year with total debt of million and million of cash  resulting in a ratio of debt  net of cash  to total capitalization of in general  we evaluate the company s financial condition and operating results by revenue  contribution income see segment information  and net income loss 
we also use measurement of our cash flow generation and operating and leverage ratios to help us assess our financial condition 
in addition  we monitor several key volume and profitability indicators such as number of orders  contract bookings  number of ftes  days filled and price 
nurse and allied staffing our nurse and allied staffing services business segment is headquartered in boca raton  florida 
our travel staffing business is operated from a relatively centralized business model servicing all of the assignment needs of our field employees and client facilities through operation centers located in boca raton  florida  malden  massachusetts  newtown square  pennsylvania  tampa  florida  and norcross  georgia 
our per diem staffing operations are provided through a network of branch offices serving major metropolitan markets predominantly located on the east and west coasts of the us our nurse and allied staffing revenue and earnings are impacted by the relative supply of nurses and demand for our staffing services at healthcare facilities 
demand for our healthcare staffing services is primarily influenced by the strength or weakness of national acute care hospital admissions relative to expectations and the volume of patients at other medical facilities  as well as labor market dynamics that influence the number of hours worked by healthcare professionals 
we believe demand for travel nurse staffing services will be favorably impacted in the long term by an aging population and an increasing shortage of nurses 
we rely significantly on our ability to recruit and retain nurses and other healthcare professionals who possess the skills  experience and  as required  licensure necessary to meet the specified requirements of our clients 
shortages of qualified nurses and other healthcare professionals could limit our ability to fill open orders and grow our revenue and net income 
in general  we believe nurses are more willing to seek travel assignments during relatively high levels of demand for contract employment  and conversely  are more reluctant to seek travel assignments during and immediately following periods of weak demand for contract employment 
we market our nurse and allied staffing services primarily to acute care hospitals and health systems and provide our clients with staffing solutions through our cross country staffing ccs  medstaff medstaff local and medstaff healthcare solutions and allied health group brands 
our professionals staff a broad range of clinical settings in the for profit and not for profit sectors throughout the us  including acute care hospitals  physician practice groups  skilled nursing facilities  nursing homes and sports medicine clinics  and  to a lesser degree  non clinical settings  such as schools 
ccs is our largest brand 
the vast majority of ccs revenue is derived from helping to meet the ongoing temporary nurse and allied health staffing needs of a diverse customer base 
additionally  as a part of its business strategy  ccs provides comprehensive managed service provider msp solutions to large hospitals and healthcare systems throughout the us to manage and outsource clinical staffing  vendor resources and a full supplemental workforce that are specifically tailored to each hospital or health system based on their workforce goals and financial targets 
our msp engagements typically incorporate one or more of our contract nurse  contract allied and or per diem staffing solutions 
typically  such arrangements require ccs to negotiate contracts with subcontractors in order to help meet the client s fill rate expectations  verify that all nurses provided both by ccs and subcontractors meet ccs credential requirements and other standards and testing requirements established by the client  verify insurance coverage of the subcontractors and their candidates  manage orders for open positions from the client and distribute those needs to subcontractors as required  interview candidates presented to ensure they meet the client s specifications  consolidate and reconcile the timecard approval and invoicing process for services provided by ccs and all subcontractors  distribute payments to subcontractors for services provided to the client  and capture and analyze data for the benefit of the client 
these services are particularly beneficial to larger facilities and systems that require many healthcare professionals across a broad spectrum of medical disciplines and specialties 
during  approximately of the staffing volume in our nurse and allied staffing segment was at msp client facilities 
in addition to directly supplying the vast majority of client needs under these msp programs  ccs has relationships with hundreds of subcontractors throughout the us to ensure that clients have access to a large pool of candidates to meet their staffing needs 
another growing component of our business is contract staffing for hospitals and health systems undergoing electronic medical record emr technology implementations pursuant to grants available to healthcare facilities under the federal health information technology for economic and clinical act hitech act 
we supply temporary healthcare professionals to provide patient care while hospital staff nurses are away in classroom settings undergoing training and to provide support to the staff rns in utilizing the emr technology upon their return to bedside care 
we expect that staffing related to emr technology implementations will be one of the growth drivers of our nurse and allied staffing segment in during  while hospital admission trends continued to remain relatively flat and the us economy struggled to improve and national unemployment remained high  we experienced a significant broad based increase in demand 
this included an increase in demand from hospital customers that had largely been dormant over the past few years  increased staffing associated with hospital electronic health record implementations and ongoing staffing activity at msp accounts 
we also experienced improved supply of qualified rns and other healthcare professionals seeking temporary assignment with us 
we believe this improvement in demand is due  in part  to several factors the non sustainability of additional hours worked by full and part time staff rns working directly for hospital employers over the past few years due to economic and labor market dynamics that negatively impacted their family 
historically  high national unemployment typically results in rns increasingly seeking employment as hospital staff nurses and those already employed as staff nurses become more willing to work more hours at prevailing wages  which combine to reduce the need for our outsourced staffing services 
the reverse begins to occur as the economy and more specifically the labor markets improve  although there is a lag between the improvement in demand for our nurse and allied staffing services and the improvement in supply of rns and other healthcare professionals 
the recovery of the stock market allowing the return to retirement of many of the more than  older rns that previously returned to the nursing workforce due to the significant decline in their savings and investments when the recent economic downturn began 
an acceleration of hospitals undergoing emr implementations pursuant to the hitech act 
the improvement in demand for our nurse and allied staffing services resulted in higher relative booking activity for future assignments that translated into an revenue gain in from the prior year reflecting a increase in staffing volume and a increase in the average revenue per fte per day 
demand was increasingly driven by staffing for emr implementations 
typically  as admissions increase for our hospital customers  temporary employees are often added before full time employees are hired 
as admissions decline  clients tend to reduce their use of temporary employees before undertaking layoffs of their staff employees 
in general  we evaluate the nurse and allied staffing business segment s financial condition and operating results by revenue and contribution income see segment information 
in addition  we monitor several key volume and profitability indicators such as number of open orders  contract bookings  number of ftes and bill rate per hour of service provided 
physician staffing we added the physician staffing business segment in with the acquisition of mda holdings  inc and its subsidiaries collectively  mda as described in the acquisitions section which follows 
mda is headquartered in norcross  georgia and offers multi specialty locum tenens temporary physician staffing services to the healthcare industry in all states 
our physician staffing business revenue and earnings are impacted by the demand for temporary physician staffing services and the supply of qualified physicians 
when there are not enough physicians to fill the number of vacancies at hospitals  practice groups or other healthcare facilities  demand increases for our services 
in general  we believe that in periods when physicians are looking for more flexibility  have concerns with cost and availability of malpractice insurance  or want to avoid managing a practice  supply increases 
in periods where the physicians are looking for more stability  supply decreases 
demand and supply constraints may vary based on the specialty of the physician 
we monitor several key volume and profitability indicators for each specialty area of this business  such as physician staffing day filled and revenue per days filled 
in addition  we monitor this segment s revenue  contribution income and contribution income as a percentage of revenue 
during  the overall economic conditions and continuing concerns with impending health care reform changes proved challenging for overall growth in the physician staffing sector 
unemployment and higher under employment were also problematic for clients relative to outsourcing their staffing needs 
given these ongoing uncertainties  physicians have increasingly opted to become employees of hospitals and health care systems 
we expect this trend to continue for the short term 
despite the current negative economic metrics  we still believe that the future outlook for the physician staffing industry is positive 
longer term trends coupled with healthcare reform are favorable with demand for physicians projected to increase significantly over the next years 
the needs will be particularly strong in the primary care specialties due to recent decreases in medical school graduates entering the primary care field 
locum tenens should benefit from these shortage trends and demands particularly with an ever increasing aging population 
mda is well positioned to respond to the current and future needs of its healthcare partners 
we also continue to believe the long term demographic drivers of this business are favorable 
these drivers include an aging population demanding more health care  an aging physician population from the baby boom generation nearing retirement age  and more females entering the profession  who historically have provided relatively less hours of service on average than males 
clinical trial services our clinical trial services business segment is headquartered at the research triangle park rtp in durham  north carolina 
we primarily provide traditional contract staffing and outsourcing services  as well as drug safety monitoring and regulatory consulting to pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device companies  as well as contract research organization cro customers 
we market these services through multiple brand offerings that have allowed us to establish a significant geographic footprint in the us along with an important presence in the european market 
our clinical trial services revenue and earnings are impacted by the number of trials being planned and conducted by pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device companies 
as a result  we are impacted by our customer s ability to obtain financing for research and development efforts 
we believe that pharmaceutical and biotech companies will continue to need to enhance their product pipelines and conduct human clinical trials to evaluate efficacy and safety 
we can provide our customers with a broad range of services  from pre clinical through post marketing 
we rely on our ability to recruit and maintain professionals who possess the skills  experience  and  as required  licensure necessary to meet the specified requirements of our clients 
the supply of clinical trials personnel in the marketplace is relatively stable and comprised primarily of healthcare professionals who have left basic care to pursue clinical research opportunities and individuals with the education and experience in life sciences 
the supply of people available for our clinical trial services is dependent on the number of clinical trial professionals not currently employed in ongoing trials  as well as new people entering the industry  net of retirements 
the r d activity by pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device companies improved somewhat during following the prior two year period in which economic factors and financial market conditions led to numerous mergers  acquisitions and business closures  along with a reduction in r d activities 
we believe this improvement resulted as some of the post acquisition transition and integration plans became clearer and these companies began to bring forward some of the projects that were previously put on hold 
in addition  many large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies started to re focus their efforts on later stage r d activities to combat the prospect of numerous patent expirations of blockbuster drugs in the coming years 
in  the staffing component of our clinical trial services business  which represented of segment revenue  experienced a modest up tick in demand represented by improved client requests for proposals  bid defenses and contract awards  as well as an increased need for permanent placement positions by our client base 
however  we experienced a shift in mix toward staffing lower bill rate professionals than we have historically 
our drug safety monitoring and regulatory compliance advisory businesses continued to remain weak in  reflecting the industry downturn in demand for earlier stage clinical services  as well as some clients taking their pharmacovigilance activities in house following mergers with larger entities 
despite the weak trends in the pharmaceutical and biotech industry over the past two years  demographic factors and advances in biotechnology and genomics should drive long term growth for this business segment 
other human capital management services education and training services our cross country education cce subsidiary  headquartered in brentwood  tennessee  provides regulatory and clinical skill based continuing education development for healthcare professionals 
cce is an approved provider of continuing education with more than professional healthcare associations  and also works with national and state boards and associations 
cce coordinates with various independent contractors in order to offer one day seminars  conferences and elearning to healthcare professionals on topics pertaining to healthcare 
since  cce has trained over  licensed professionals in the fields of physical and occupational therapy  behavioral health  nursing  long term care  coding and billing  regulatory compliance  dentistry  health information and healthcare administration 
in  cce held approximately  seminars and conferences that were attended by nearly  registrants in cities in the us and canada 
we extend these educational services to our field employees on favorable terms as a recruitment and retention tool 
in  cce s live seminar attendance decreased approximately due to what we believe are several factors 
first  significant budget cuts to both non medicaid and medicaid based mental health services negatively impacted employment for public mental health programs  which reduced demand for these programs and resulted in these professionals utilizing to a greater degree continuing education credits via e learning offerings 
second  the education industry is increasingly offering live webcasting and rebroadcasting of seminars 
to address this shift  cce has significantly expanded its offerings in this area while continuing to provide thousands of live seminars each year 
retained search our cejka search subsidiary is headquartered in creve coeur  missouri  a business district centered within the st 
louis metropolitan area 
cejka search has been a leading physician  allied health and healthcare executive search firm for years  recruiting top healthcare talent for organizations nationwide through a team of experienced professionals  award winning recruitment technology and commitment to service excellence 
serving clients nationwide  cejka search annually completes hundreds of search assignments for organizations spanning the continuum of healthcare  including physician group practices  hospitals and health systems  academic medical centers  managed care and other healthcare organizations 
in  ongoing uncertainty about health care reform  medicare reimbursement rules and the pace of economic recovery continued to limit or delay implementation of the industry s medical staff and administrative leadership recruitment plans  which consequently negatively impacted demand for retained search services 
despite these market conditions  cejka search experienced modest year over year growth in revenue and contribution income due to strategic changes made to its business model in the prior year to be more competitive  expand market reach  and improve operating efficiency 
we believe cejka search is well positioned to benefit from further economic recovery  the intensifying shortage of physicians and midlevel providers  and the critical need for effective healthcare executive leadership  in particular physician executive leaders

comparison of results for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue from services revenue from services increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to higher revenue from our nurse and allied staffing segment  and secondarily to higher revenue from our clinical trial services staffing business segment  partially offset by decreases in revenue from our physician staffing and other human capital management services business segments 
nurse and allied staffing revenue from our nurse and allied staffing business segment increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   primarily due to higher volume 
the higher staffing volume in reflects significant improvement in demand  as measured by the number of open orders  throughout  aided by an increase in applicants applying for assignments with us 
the average number of nurse and allied staffing ftes on contract during the year ended december   increased from the year ended december  average nurse and allied staffing revenue per fte increased approximately in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   reflecting an increase in our average hourly bill rate and an increase in hours provided by our healthcare professionals

direct operating expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for year ended december  as a percentage of total revenue  direct operating expenses represented of revenue for the year ended december   and for the year ended december  this increase was due to a combination of factors including a shift in our business mix towards the nurse and allied staffing segment  higher physician expenses as a percent of revenue  lower professional liability expenses and lower permanent placement revenue in our physician staffing segment  along with a contraction in our bill pay spread and higher housing costs in our nurse and allied staffing segment 
these factors were partially offset by lower workers compensation expenses in our nurse and allied staffing business segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses in the year ended december  included million resulting from an increase in our accrual for sales and other state non income taxes  as a result of a determination made in the fourth quarter of that it was probable we would be assessed in certain states for tax years see note commitments and contingencies for more information

contribution income contribution income from our nurse and allied staffing segment for the year ended december   increased million or  to million from million in year ended december  as a percentage of nurse and allied staffing revenue  segment contribution income was for the year ended december   and for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to a contraction in our bill pay spread and higher housing costs partially offset by lower workers compensation expenses 
contribution income from our physician staffing segment for the year ended december   decreased million or to million compared to million in the year ended december  as a percentage of physician staffing revenue  contribution income was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a change in specialty mix resulting in higher physician expense as a percentage of revenue  an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses related to a portion of the aforementioned increase in our accrual for sales and other state non income taxes  and lower permanent placement revenue 
partially offsetting these decreases were lower professional liability expenses as a percentage of revenue in this segment in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   based on better than expected loss development 
contribution income from clinical trial services for the year ended december   increased million  or  to million  compared to million in the year ended december  as a percentage of clinical trial services revenue  segment contribution income was in the year ended december   compared to in the year ended december  contribution income from other human capital management services for the year ended december   decreased by million  or  to million  from million in the year ended december  due to a decrease in contribution income from the education and training business  partially offset by an increase in contribution income from our retained search businesses

thus  our calculation of estimated fair value using the projected revenue stream indicated the carrying amount of the trademarks acquired with the mda acquisition in september might not have been fully recoverable 
based on these circumstances  we recorded a pre tax non cash impairment charge  of which million related to our physician staffing segment and million related to our nurse and allied staffing segment 
see critical accounting principles and estimates and our consolidated financial statements note goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets  for more information 
foreign exchange gain loss foreign exchange gains of million were realized in the period ended december   compared to million of losses realized in the year ended december  foreign currency gains and losses are realized upon the settlement of cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies 
interest expense interest expense totaled million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  lower interest expense was due to a lower effective interest rate on our borrowings and lower average borrowings in the year ended december  the effective interest rate on our borrowings for the year ended december   was compared to a rate of for the year ended december  the decrease in the effective interest rate on our borrowings was primarily a result of the expiration of interest rate swaps in the fourth quarter of interest expense in the year ended december  included an estimate of million ineffectiveness on our interest rate swaps caused by significant prepayments on our term loan borrowings 
see note interest rate swap agreements in our notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our interest rate swap agreements 
other income  net other income  net includes interest income on our cash and cash equivalents and short and long term cash investments  and other income and expense 
during the year ended december  and  other income  net is primarily interest income  and was million and million  respectively 
income tax expense benefit income tax expense totaled million for the year ended december   as compared to an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  the effective tax rate was in the year ended december   compared to in the year ended december  the higher effective tax rate in the year ended december  was partly due to an adjustment of million to income tax expense in the fourth quarter of related to an overstatement of deferred tax assets in prior periods 
excluding this adjustment  the effective tax rate was in the year ended december  the lower effective tax rate in the year ended december  resulted from the impact of the deferred tax benefit on impairment charges of million 
excluding the impairment charges and related deferred tax benefit  the adjusted effective tax rate would have been comparison of results for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue from services revenue from services decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was due to lower revenue from our nurse and allied staffing  physician staffing and clinical trial services business segments  partially offset by an increase in revenue from our other human capital management services business segment 
the decreases in revenue reflected the challenging operating environment that all of our business segments experienced resulting from decreased demand from our customers 
nurse and allied staffing revenue from our nurse and allied staffing business segment decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   primarily due to lower volume  but also due to lower average bill rates 
the lower staffing volume in reflected the continued impact of a weak national labor market since the fall of the average number of nurse and allied staffing ftes on contract during the year ended december   decreased from the year ended december  average nurse and allied staffing revenue per fte decreased approximately in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  physician staffing revenue from our physician staffing business decreased million  or to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the revenue decline reflected decreased demand for our temporary physician staffing services  in a number of specialties  particularly our anesthesiology specialty 
physician staffing days filled was  in the year ended december  and revenue per day filled for the year ended december  was  beginning in the first quarter of  the company refined its statistical methodology related to its physician staffing days filled metrics 
accordingly  historical data for these metrics have been revised to conform to the current year s presentation 
historical data for the year ended december  has not been reclassified due to excessive cost of applying the methodology  which  the company believes outweighs the benefit of the additional information 
clinical trial services revenue from clinical trial services decreased million  or  to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  this decline was primarily due to several clinical research projects that ended in the third quarter of  a decrease in revenue from a specific drug safety contract and a decrease in contract staffing volume 
other human capital management services revenue from other human capital management services for the year ended december   increased million  or  to million from million in the year ended december   entirely due to an increase in revenue from our education and training business  primarily as a result of higher average seminar attendance 
revenue from our retained search business was down slightly compared to direct operating expenses direct operating expenses are comprised primarily of field employee and independent contractor compensation expenses  housing expenses  travel expenses and field insurance expenses 
direct operating expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for year ended december  as a percentage of total revenue  direct operating expenses represented of revenue for the year ended december   and for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to a change in the mix of our business segments  a widening of our bill pay spread and lower housing costs in our travel staffing operations  and lower professional liability expenses as a percentage of revenue in our physician staffing business 
lower professional liability expenses in our physician staffing business segment reflected better than expected loss development  and to a lesser extent a change in the mix of business to lower risk specialties 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses were primarily due to our efforts to reduce overhead expenses 
included in selling  general and administrative expenses is unallocated corporate overhead of million for year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  included in unallocated corporate overhead are million and million of share based compensation expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as a percentage of consolidated revenue  unallocated corporate overhead was for the year ended december   and for the year ended december  as a percentage of total revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses were and  respectively  for the year ended december  and  respectively 
this increase is primarily due to negative operating leverage and a change in mix of our business segments 
bad debt expense bad debt expense as a percentage of total revenue was  or million for the year ended december  no bad debt expense was recognized for the year ended december   due to improved collections 
the company s calculation and methodology remain consistent 
contribution income contribution income from our nurse and allied staffing segment for the year ended december   decreased million or  to million from million in year ended december  as a percentage of nurse and allied staffing revenue  segment contribution income was for the year ended december   and for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to negative operating leverage and higher field insurance expenses as a percentage of revenue  partially offset by a widening of our bill pay spread and a decline in housing costs 
contribution income from our physician staffing segment for the year ended december   decreased million or to million compared to million in the year ended december  as a percentage of physician staffing revenue  contribution income was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the improvement in contribution income as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to lower professional liability expense in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   reflecting better than expected loss development as well as a change in mix to lower risk specialties 
contribution income from clinical trial services for the year ended december   decreased million  or  to million  compared to million in the year ended december  as a percentage of clinical trial services revenue  segment contribution income was in the year ended december   compared to in the year ended december   primarily due to efforts to reduce overhead expenses 
contribution income from other human capital management services for the year ended december   increased by million  or  to million  from million in the year ended december  due to increases in contribution income from both the education and training and retained search businesses 
contribution income as a percentage of other human capital management services revenue was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december   primarily reflecting improved leverage in our education and training business and lower selling  general and administrative expenses in our retained search businesses 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense in the year ended december   totaled million as compared to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  depreciation and amortization expense was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  impairment charges impairment charges of million in the year ended december  resulted from the impact lower locum tenens usage has had on our long term revenue forecast 
thus  our calculation of estimated fair value using the projected revenue stream indicated the carrying amount of the trademarks acquired with the mda acquisition in september might not have been fully recoverable 
based on these circumstances  we recorded a pre tax non cash impairment charge  of which million related to our physician staffing segment and million related to our nurse and allied staffing segment 
impairment charges of million in the year ended december  resulted from the consolidation of our non staffing brands within our clinical trial services business segment to gain operating efficiencies 
as a result of this consolidation  we determined that one of the trademarks and database will no longer be used and  accordingly  we recorded a million non cash impairment charge 
see critical accounting principles and estimates and our consolidated financial statements note goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets  for more information 
foreign exchange gain loss foreign exchange losses of million were realized in the period ended december  and foreign currency gains and losses are realized upon the settlement of cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies 
interest expense interest expense totaled million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  lower interest expense was due to lower average borrowings in the year ended december   partially offset by a higher effective interest rate on our borrowings 
higher borrowings in the year ended december   were primarily due to the financing of the mda acquisition 
the effective interest rate on our borrowings for the year ended december   was compared to a rate of for the year ended december  interest expense in the year ended december  included an estimate of million ineffectiveness on our interest rate swaps caused by significant prepayments on our term loan borrowings 
the estimate was trued up in the year ended december   coinciding with the interest rate swap payments 
see note interest rate swap agreements in our notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our interest rate swap agreements which expired in the fourth quarter of other income  net other income  net includes interest income on our cash and cash equivalents and short and long term cash investments  and other income and expense 
during the year ended december  other income  net of million is primarily interest income 
during the year ended december   other income  net was million and included million of a gain on the sale of marketable securities 
income tax benefit expense income tax benefit totaled million for the year ended december   as compared to income tax expense of million for the year ended december  the effective tax rate was in the year ended december   compared to in the year ended december  the lower effective tax rate in the year ended december  resulted from the impact of the deferred tax benefit on impairment charges of million 
excluding the impairment charges and related deferred tax benefit  the adjusted effective tax rate would have been 
the effective tax rate excluding the impairment legal settlement charges would have been 
this increase in the effective rate was due to the relatively greater impact of the non deductibility of certain per diem payments on pretax income excluding impairment charges compared to its impact on pretax income excluding impairment charges and legal settlement charges 
transactions with related parties we provide services to hospitals which are affiliated with certain board of director members 
revenue related to these transactions amounted to approximately million  million and million in aggregate for the years ended december    and  respectively 
accounts receivable due from these hospitals at december  and were approximately million and million  respectively 
pricing for our services is consistent with our other hospital customers 
in the year ended december   we entered into an msp arrangement with one of the hospital systems 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had a current ratio  defined as the amount of current assets divided by current liabilities  of to working capital decreased by million to million as of december   compared to million as of december  days sales outstanding increased day and was days at december  and days at december   consistent with historical ranges 
our operating cash flows constitute our primary source of liquidity  and historically  have been sufficient to fund our working capital  capital expenditures  internal business expansion and debt service including our commitments as described in the commitments table which follows 
we believe that our capital resources are sufficient to meet our working capital needs for the next twelve months 
we expect to meet our future needs for working capital  capital expenditures  internal business expansion and debt service from a combination of operating cash flows and funds available through the revolving loan portion of our current credit agreement 
we continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities that may require additional funding 
in addition to those amounts available under our existing credit agreement  we may incur up to an additional million in indebtedness as defined by the credit agreement 
stock repurchase programs in february  our board of directors authorized our most recent stock repurchase program whereby we may purchase up to million shares of our common stock  subject to the terms of our credit agreement 
the shares may be repurchased from time to time in the open market and the repurchase program may be discontinued at any time at our discretion 
during the year ended december   we repurchased under this program   shares of our common stock at an average price of per share 
the cost of such purchases was approximately million 
all of the common stock was retired 
during year ended december  and  we did not repurchase shares 
at december   we had  shares of common stock left remaining to repurchase under our february authorization  subject to the limitations of our credit agreement 
see credit agreement section below and consolidated financial statements note long term debt 
credit agreement we have a credit agreement which includes a term loan  a revolving loan facility and swingline loans as defined in the credit agreement 
on may   we entered into a first amendment to our credit agreement with the lenders party thereto and wells fargo bank  national association successor by merger to wachovia bank  national association as administrative agent 
the credit agreement amendment  among other things  extends the maturity date of the revolving credit facility from november to september to be coterminous with the term loan facility  and reduces our existing revolving credit facility to million from million  and our sublimit for letters of credit to million from million 
our sublimit for the issuance of swingline loans remained at million 
the revolving loan facility and term loan bear interest at a rate of  at our option  either i london interbank offered rate libor plus a leverage based margin or ii base rate as defined in the credit agreement plus a leverage based margin 
we paid million of financing fees related to this amendment that have been capitalized as debt issuance costs 
debt issuance costs related to this amendment are being amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining term of the credit agreement 
in addition  we wrote off an immaterial amount of debt issuance costs related to the reduction of the size of the revolving credit facility 
as of december   interest on our revolving credit facility was based on libor plus a margin of or base rate as defined by the credit agreement plus a margin of 
the interest rate spreads on our term loan as of december  were based on libor plus a margin of or base rate plus a margin of 
the company is required to pay a quarterly commitment fee on the average daily unused portion of the revolving loan facility  which  as of december  was 
as a result of our reduced leverage as of december   our applicable margins were reduced by basis points in march the revolving loan facility is being used for general corporate purposes including working capital  capital expenditures and permitted acquisitions and investments  as well as to pay fees and expenses related to the credit facility 
swingline loans and letters of credit issued under this facility reduce the revolving loan facility on a dollar for dollar basis 
as of december   we did not have any borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility  but had million of standby letters of credit outstanding under this facility  leaving million available for borrowing under our revolving loan facility 
the credit agreement includes customary covenants and events of default 
as of december   we were in compliance with the financial covenants and other covenants contained in the credit agreement 
specifically  the table below summarizes what we believe are the key financial covenants  as defined by the credit agreement  and our corresponding actual performance as of december  requirement actual maximum permitted leverage ratio a to to minimum fixed charge coverage ratio b to to maximum capital expenditures for c million million a the company s leverage ratio must not be greater than to for the duration of the credit agreement ending september b the company s fixed charge coverage ratio as defined by the credit agreement must not be less than to for the fiscal year  to for the fiscal year and to thereafter 
c the capital expenditures limit as defined by the credit agreement may be increased in any fiscal year by the amount of capital expenditures that were permitted but not made in the immediately preceding fiscal year 
the aggregate capital expenditures limit for the fiscal years following as defined by the credit agreement are million in the fiscal year  million in the fiscal year  and million in the fiscal year the limit in the preceding table reflects an increase of million representing the fiscal year excess that was permitted but not made 
the terms of the credit agreement include customary covenants and events of default for similarly leveraged deals 
the credit agreement includes a mandatory prepayment provision  which requires us to make mandatory prepayments subsequent to receiving net proceeds from the sale of assets  insurance recoveries  or the issuance of our debt or equity 
in addition  when our consolidated total leverage ratio as of the end of a fiscal year is greater than or equal to to  we are required to make principal prepayments of at least of excess cash flow  both  as defined by the agreement 
no additional principal prepayments are expected relating to excess cash flow for the dividends and distribution covenant limits our ability to repurchase our common stock and declare and pay cash dividends on our common stock 
the credit agreement  as amended  provides for an amount allowed for stock repurchases dividends subsequent to may   that is the lesser of million and of cumulative consolidated net income as defined by the credit agreement for each fiscal quarter after march  where financial statements have been delivered  provided  that our debt ebitda ratio as defined by the credit agreement  after giving effect to the transaction  is less than to and there is million in cash or available cash under its revolving loan facility 
however  if our debt ebitda ratio  after giving effect to the transaction is less than to but equal to or greater than to  and there are no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility other than letters of credit  the allowable amount for repurchases dividends is million 
under these limitations  during the year ended december   we repurchased a total of  shares for approximately million 
our requirement to obtain lender consent for acquisitions was also adjusted 
effective with the may amendment  we are required to obtain the consent of our lenders to complete any acquisition which exceeds million or would cause us to exceed million in aggregate cash and non cash consideration for permitted acquisitions as defined by the credit agreement during the term of the credit agreement excluding the mda acquisition 
the commitments under the credit agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of our company 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december  was million compared to million during the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to an increase in our accounts receivable in the year ended december  compared to a decrease in accounts receivable in the year ended december  the increase in accounts receivable in the year ended december  is reflective of the increase in revenue we have experienced in during the year ended december  we experienced sequential declines in revenue with relatively similar days sales outstanding 
investing activities used million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  during the year ended december   we used million to pay an earnout related to the mda acquisition 
the earnout payment was based on mda s performance 
we used million and million  respectively for capital expenditures during the years ended december  and in addition  other investing activities used million and million  respectively  during the years ended december  and other investing activities reflect our investments in short and long term cash investments that are highly liquid with underlying maturities greater than days 
net cash used in financing activities during the year ended december   was million  compared to million during the year ended december  we repaid total debt  net of borrowings  in the amounts of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively  primarily using cash flow from operations 
during the year ended december   we also paid debt issuance costs of million related to our credit agreement amendment previously described

year ended december  compared to year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december  was million compared to million during the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to lower collections of accounts receivable in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   primarily due to declining revenue since december investing activities used million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  during the year ended december   we used million to pay an earnout related to the mda acquisition 
the earnout payment was based on mda s performance 
we used million during the year ended december  to pay the earnout related to mda s performance 
in addition  in  we used million to pay a earnout related to our akos acquisition 
we used million and million  respectively for capital expenditures during the years ended december  and in addition  other investing activities used million and million  respectively  during the years ended december  and other investing activities reflect our investments in short and long term cash investments that are highly liquid with underlying maturities greater than days 
net cash used in financing activities during the year ended december   was million  compared to million during the year ended december  we repaid total debt  net of borrowings  in both years  in the amounts of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively  primarily using cash flow from operations 
during the year ended december   we also paid debt issuance costs of million related to our credit agreement amendment previously described 
we used million and million to repurchase shares of common stock to cover withholding liabilities related to the vesting of restricted stock 
during the year ended december   additional cash was provided by million of restricted cash that was released and million of proceeds and tax benefits from the exercise of stock options 
commitments and off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
the following table reflects our contractual obligations and other commitments as of december  commitments total thereafter unaudited  amounts in thousands senior secured credit facility a capital lease obligations operating leases obligations b purchase obligations c a under our credit facility  we are required to comply with certain financial covenants 
our inability to comply with the required covenants or other provisions could result in default under our credit facility

b represents future minimum lease payments associated with operating lease agreements with original terms of more than one year 
c other contractual obligations include contracts for information systems consulting services 
in addition to the above disclosed contractual obligations  the company has accrued uncertain tax positions  pursuant to the income taxes topic of the fasb asc of million at december  based on the uncertainties associated with the settlement of these items  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of potential settlements  if any  with the taxing authorities 
critical accounting principles and estimates we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  including those related to asset impairment  accruals for self insurance  allowance for doubtful accounts  taxes and other contingencies and litigation 
we state our accounting policies in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   contained herein 
these estimates are based on information that is currently available to us and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we have recorded goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions through december  in accordance with the intangibles goodwill and other topic of the fasb asc  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
pursuant to the annual testing of goodwill  in the fourth quarters of  and we evaluated five reporting units nurse and allied staffing  physician staffing  clinical trial services  retained search and education and training 
upon completion of the first step in our annual impairment assessment as of december  and  we determined that no impairment was indicated 
for the december  impairment test  we estimated the fair value of each our reporting units based on a weighting of both the income approach and the market approach blended fair value 
the discounted cash flows for each reporting unit that served as the primary basis for the income approach were based on discrete financial forecasts developed by management for planning purposes and consistent with those distributed within the company and externally 
a number of significant assumptions and estimates were involved in the application of the income methodology including forecasted revenue  margins  operating cash flows  discount rate  and working capital changes 
cash flows beyond the discrete forecast period of ten years were estimated using a terminal value calculation 
a terminal value growth rate of was used for each reporting unit 
the income approach valuations included reporting unit cash flow discount rates  representing each reporting unit s weighted average cost of capital wacc  ranging from to 
the market approach applied pricing multiples derived from publicly traded guideline companies that are comparable to the respective reporting unit  to determine its value 
we utilized total enterprise value revenue multiples ranging from to and total enterprise value ebitda multiples ranging from to the reporting unit s market value was determined assuming a weighting to revenue multiples and a weighting to ebitda multiples for our nurse and allied  physician staffing and clinical trial services reporting units  a weighting to ebitda multiples for our education and training reporting unit  and a weighting to revenue multiples for our retained search reporting unit 
the total fair value of the reporting units was reconciled to our december  market capitalization 
the reasonableness of the resulting control premium was assessed based on a review of comparative market transactions and other qualitative factors that might have influenced our share price 
the fair value under the blended fair value approach implied a control premium of  which is an amount we estimate a buyer would be willing to pay in excess of the december  market price of in order to acquire a controlling interest 
our market capitalization was also considered in assessing the reasonableness of the cumulative fair values of the reporting units 
our market capitalization as of december  was approximately million 
in performing the reconciliation of our market capitalization to fair value  we considered both quantitative and qualitative factors which supported the implied control premium 
upon completion of the december  assessment  we determined that the estimated fair value of all of our reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values as follows nurse and allied staffing  physician staffing  clinical trial services  retained search and education and training 
the estimated fair value of our reporting units is highly sensitive to changes in projections and assumptions  therefore  in some instances minor changes in these assumptions could impact whether the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying value 
clinical trial services reporting unit our clinical trial services reporting unit was at risk of failing the step one impairment test 
this reporting unit grew its revenue and contribution income during  and  thus far in  its backlog of contracted business is up substantially from this recent performance has been relied upon  in part  in our determination that impairment did not exist at december  however  this reporting unit is at risk of a future impairment in the event of significant unfavorable changes in the forecasted cash flows or the key assumptions used in our analysis 
examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of our clinical trial services reporting unit may include such items as the following the assumed renewal of business or bringing in new business later in the year may not come to fruition 
the concentration of business we receive from several key customers  the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on the business 
cancellation or delay in a clinical trial  for which we are providing staffing or drug safety services could have a material adverse effect on the business 
consolidation of our customer base in the pharmaceutical biotech industry could result in delays or reductions in purchases of our services 
disruption in the capital markets  resulting in the inability of customers to access capital or in a higher discount rate to be used in our fair value analysis 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future 
although management believes the assumptions and estimates made are reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially impact the reported financial results 
an increase of basis points in the assumed weighted average cost of capital  a decrease in the assumed terminal value growth rate of basis points  or a decrease in the projected cash flows could cause the fair value of our clinical trial services reporting unit to be below its carrying value 
goodwill for this reporting unit is million as of december   or of our total assets 
during  we will monitor this unit s performance and determine whether a reassessment is necessary regarding potential impairment of goodwill 
the table below provides a sensitivity analysis related to the impact of changes in certain key assumptions  on a standalone basis  on the percentage variance between fair value and carrying value for each of the reporting units sensitivity analysis fair value variance versus carrying value december  fair value variance versus carrying value basis point increase in wacc basis point decrease in terminal growth rate reduction in after tax cash flows nurse and allied staffing physician staffing clinical trial services education and training retained search in addition  the property  plant and equipment impairment of disposal of long lived assets topic of the fasb asc  requires us to test the recoverability of long lived assets  including identifiable intangible assets with definite lives  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in testing for potential impairment  if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the expected undiscounted cash flows  we must then determine the amount by which the fair value of those assets exceeds the carrying value and determine the amount of impairment  if any 
in the fourth quarter of  in conjunction with our annual testing of other indefinite lived intangible assets not subject to amortization  no impairments were identified 
the estimated fair value of our other indefinite lived intangible assets are highly sensitive to changes in projections and assumptions  therefore  in some instances minor changes in these assumptions could impact whether the fair value of the other indefinite lived intangible assets are greater than their carrying value 
an increase in the assumed weighted average cost of capital of basis points could cause the fair value of our physician staffing trademark to be below its carrying value  or a reduction of million 
as of december   other indefinite lived intangible assets not subject to amortization on our consolidated balance sheets totaled million 
in the fourth quarter of  in conjunction with our annual testing of indefinite lived intangible assets not subject to amortization  we recorded a pre tax non cash impairment charge of approximately million of which million related to the physician staffing segment and million related to the nurse and allied staffing segment 
the assessment was impacted by a then recent reduction in locum tenens usage and the overall physician staffing needs of our customers 
based on the impact those trends had on the long term revenue forecast  our calculation of estimated fair value using the projected revenue stream indicated the carrying amount of the trademark may not have been fully recoverable 
in the fourth quarter of  we streamlined our non staffing operations within the clinical trial services segment to gain efficiencies  including a change in our marketing strategy for the business 
based on these circumstances  and in conjunction with our annual testing of indefinite lived intangible assets  we recorded a pre tax non cash impairment charge which represented the entire carrying value of a trademark and database of approximately million 
these charges are included in impairment charges on the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  and the calculation of fair value used in these impairment assessments included a number of estimates and assumptions that required significant judgments  including projections of future income and cash flows  the identification of appropriate market multiples and the choice of an appropriate discount rate 
changes in these assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit 
specifically  further deterioration of demand for our services  further deterioration of labor market conditions  reduction of our stock price for an extended period  or other factors as described in item a risk factors  may affect our determination of fair value of each reporting unit 
this evaluation can also be triggered by various indicators of impairment which could cause the estimated discounted cash flows to be less than the carrying amount of net assets 
if we are required to record an impairment charge in the future  it could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
under the current credit agreement an impairment charge will not have an impact on our liquidity 
as of december   we had total goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization of million 
we maintain accruals for our health  workers compensation and professional liability insurance policies that are partially self insured and are classified as accrued compensation and benefits on our consolidated balance sheets 
we determine the adequacy of these accruals by periodically evaluating our historical experience and trends related to health  workers compensation and professional liability claims and payments  based on actuarial models  as well as industry experience and trends 
if such models indicate that our accruals are overstated or understated  we will reduce or provide for additional accruals as appropriate 
healthcare insurance accruals have fluctuated with increases or decreases in the average number of temporary healthcare professionals on assignment as well as actual company experience and increases in national healthcare costs 
as of december  and  we had million and million accrued  respectively  for incurred but not reported health insurance claims 
corporate and field employees are covered through a partially self insured health plan 
workers compensation insurance accruals can fluctuate over time due to the number of employees and inflation  as well as additional exposures arising from the current policy year 
as of december   we had million accrued for incurred but not reported workers compensation claims and retentions a decrease of million over the amount accrued at december  the accrual for workers compensation is based on an actuarial model which is prepared or reviewed by an independent actuary 
as of december   and  we had million and million accrued  respectively  for incurred but not reported professional liability claims and retentions 
the accrual for professional liability is based on an actuarial model which is prepared or reviewed by an independent actuary 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments  which results in a provision for bad debt expense 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by continually evaluating individual customer receivables  considering the customer s financial condition  credit history and current economic conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we write off specific accounts based on an ongoing review of collectibility as well as our past experience with the customer 
historically  losses on uncollectible accounts have not exceeded our allowances 
as of december   our allowance for doubtful accounts was million 
we are subject to various claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of our business 
some of these matters include professional liability and employee related matters 
our healthcare facility clients may also become subject to claims  governmental inquiries and investigations and legal actions to which we may become a party relating to services provided by our professionals 
from time to time  and depending upon the particular facts and circumstances  we may be subject to indemnification obligations under our contracts with our healthcare facility clients relating to these matters 
material pending legal proceedings brought against us  if any  other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business are described in legal proceedings 
we account for income taxes in accordance with the income taxes topic of the fasb asc 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and other loss carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
as of december   we have deferred tax assets related to certain federal  state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of million for which we have recorded a valuation allowance of million 
the state carryforwards will expire between and the federal carryforwards expire between and the majority of the foreign carryforwards are in a jurisdiction with no expiration 
in addition  the tax effect resulting from our goodwill impairment charge recorded in the year ended december   caused the net deferred tax liability position to change to a net deferred tax asset position at that time 
we have determined that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset related to the goodwill impairment charge of million will be realized in the future with the exception of a specific state portion of the net deferred tax asset for which a valuation allowance of million has been recorded 
in considering whether or not a valuation allowance is appropriate we consider several sources of taxable income  including  but not limited to the following items the reversal of taxable temporary differences to offset deductible temporary differences in the future 
carryback potential to support the utilization of the deferred tax asset 
projections of future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 
in our determination at december   we relied partially on projections of future taxable income  exclusive of reversing temporary differences  to reach our conclusion that no valuation allowance is necessary on the net deferred tax asset  except as otherwise discussed 
however  if the levels of future taxable income we have projected are not achieved  there is a risk that the company could not recover this entire net deferred tax asset 
we will continue  in the future  to evaluate whether or not the net deferred tax assets will be fully realized prior to expiration 
in calculating the provision for income taxes on an interim basis  we use an estimate of the annual effective tax rate based upon the facts and circumstances known at each interim period 
on a quarterly basis  the actual effective tax rate is adjusted as appropriate based upon the actual results as compared to those forecasted at the beginning of the fiscal year 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our consolidated provision for income taxes and recording the related deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
accruals for unrecognized tax benefits are provided for in accordance with the income taxes topic of the fasb asc 
an unrecognized tax benefit represents the difference between the recognition of benefits related to exposure items for income tax reporting purposes and financial reporting purposes 
the current portion of the unrecognized tax benefit is classified as a component of other current liabilities  and the non current portion is included within other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   total unrecognized tax benefits recorded was million 
we have a reserve for interest and penalties on exposure items  if applicable  which is recorded as a component of the overall income tax provision 
we are regularly under audit by tax authorities 
although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain  we believe that we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns and that our annual tax provision includes amounts sufficient to pay any assessments 
nonetheless  the amounts ultimately paid  if any  upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year 
our sales and other non income tax filings are subject to routine audits by authorities in the jurisdictions where we conduct business  which may result in assessments of additional taxes 
as a result of a state administrative ruling  we determined that additional sales and non income taxes were probable of being assessed for certain states 
the total amount accrued is based on our best estimate of our probable liability and is based on current available information and interpretation of relevant tax regulations 
in the fourth quarter of  we estimated an incremental sales and non income tax liability  included in selling  general and administrative expenses  of approximately million pretax 
approximately million of the estimated liability relates to tax years 
given the nature of the company s business  significant subjectivity exists as to both whether sales and other non income tax can be assessed on the activity and how the sales tax will ultimately be measured by the relevant jurisdictions 
the company makes a determination each reporting period whether the estimates for sales and other non income taxes in certain states should be revised

we expect to adopt this standard for our consolidated financial statements beginning in the first quarter of seasonality the number of healthcare professionals on assignment with us is subject to moderate seasonal fluctuations which may impact our quarterly revenue and earnings 
hospital patient census and staffing needs of our hospital and healthcare facilities fluctuate which impact our number of orders for a particular period 
many of our hospital and healthcare facility clients are located in areas that experience seasonal fluctuations in population during the winter and summer months 
these facilities adjust their staffing levels to accommodate the change in this seasonal demand and many of these facilities utilize temporary healthcare professionals to satisfy these seasonal staffing needs 
likewise  the number of nurse and allied professionals on assignment may fluctuate due to the seasonal preferences for destinations of our temporary nurse and allied professionals 
in addition  we expect our physician staffing business to experience higher demand in the summer months as physicians take vacations 
this historical seasonality of revenue and earnings may vary due to a variety of factors and the results of any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year 
in addition  typically  our first quarter results are negatively impacted by the reset of payroll taxes 
inflation during the last several years  the rate of inflation in healthcare related services has exceeded that of the economy as a whole 
our direct costs are affected by fluctuations in housing costs and healthcare and workers compensation insurance 
during  our direct costs increased as a result of rising housing costs 
depending on the demand environment  we may be able to recoup the negative impact of such fluctuations by increasing our billing rates 
we may not be able to continue increasing our billing rates and increases in our direct operating costs may adversely affect us in the future 
in addition  our clients are impacted by payments for healthcare reimbursements by federal and state governments as well as private insurers

changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact translations of foreign denominated assets and liabilities into us dollars and future earnings and cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies 
our international operations generated less than of our consolidated revenue during the years ending december   and  and were primarily from the united kingdom 
in addition  approximately of selling  general and administrative expenses are related to certain software development and information technology support provided by our employees in pune  india 
we have not entered into any foreign currency hedges 
our international operations transact business in their functional currency 
as a result  fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies against the us dollar have an impact on reported results 
revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars at monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
consequently  as the value of the us dollar changes relative to the currencies of our non us markets  our reported results vary 
fluctuations in exchange rates also impact the us dollar amount of stockholders equity 
the assets and liabilities of our non us subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the end of a reporting period 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders equity  as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss  included in other stockholders equity on our consolidated balance sheet
