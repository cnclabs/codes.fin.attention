overview innotrac  founded in and headquartered in atlanta  georgia  is a full service fulfillment and logistics provider serving enterprise clients and world class brands 
the company employs sophisticated order processing and warehouse management technology and operates seven fulfillment centers and one call center in seven cities spanning all time zones across the continental united states 
prior to  the company was primarily focused on the telecommunications industry  with over of its revenues being derived through this vertical 
today  the company primarily serves four lines of business  or industry verticals 
this is a result of a significant effort made by the company to diversify both its industry and client base over the past several years 
we classify those industry verticals as i ecommerce direct to consumer  ii direct marketing  iii business to business  and iv telecommunication products and modems 
despite unfavorable economic conditions  our business development efforts in the ecommerce fulfillment market during generated a significant number of opportunities for new business as retail store brands enter the ecommerce market and ecommerce companies look to change fulfillment service providers 
additionally  some of our larger clients experienced an increase in volume in compared to and have indicated an expectation of continued volume growth in our business has a long selling cycle 
discussions with several potential customers in and resulted in signed contracts at the end of  late in and the first quarter of as a result of this selling cycle  we increased our customer base during and we project to continue to increase our customer base during we experienced a growth of in service revenues in compared to and with the combined effect of new clients sold in with projected growth from our existing clients  we expect even stronger growth in compared to innotrac has more than twenty five years of experience as a provider of fulfillment services and recognizes the importance of maintaining sufficient capacity to support our clients seasonal needs as well as allow us to grow with new clients 
with no outstanding advances on our credit facility at december   we have the liquidity to increase our capacity as needed and to continue to invest in our business development activities in macro economic factors beginning at the end of  the united states economy and equity markets went into a negative cycle 
the downturn in the economy affected nearly all sectors of the economy and our existing client volumes 
we are optimistic that continued improvement in general economic conditions will lead to improved volumes for our existing clients during we are continuing to monitor the economic trends and business experience of our customers and closely manage our operating costs which vary with volume 
additionally  we believe our mix of multiple customer industries provides some protection from the impact of the downturn as the economy recovers 
however  as discussed in item a risk factors of this annual report on form k our results can be negatively affected depending on the severity or concentration by industry of a renewed downturn 
business mix the following table sets forth the percentage of revenues generated by the company s various business lines during and business line vertical ecommerce direct to consumer direct marketing modems telecommunications products bb the above table is compiled by presenting the total of any individual client in a single business line vertical consistently in the years and based on the predominant category of the client s revenues for the year ended ecommerce direct to consumer and direct marketing 
the company provides a variety of services for a significant number of ecommerce  retail  and direct marketing clients which include such companies as target 
com  a division of target corporation  ann taylor retail  inc  the north face  microsoft  inc  beachbody  llc and thane international 
our revenues are a result of the number of orders and customer service calls received 
our client contracts generally do not guarantee volumes 
the percentage of our revenues attributable to our ecommerce and retail clients increased during as compared to as a result of the growth in their reported revenue during the same period having increased greater than our other client categories 
we expect this trend to continue as we anticipate more opportunities for new business in this line and expect a higher level of organic growth than our other consumer categories 
telecommunications and modems 
the company has historically been a major provider of fulfillment and customer support services to the telecommunications industry 
the consolidation in that industry over the last several years has resulted in a heavy concentration of volume in a few companies  and accordingly  concentration of the service providers to the telecommunication industry 
we do not project this category to grow in unless an existing client increases its volume significantly enough to increase the category s percent of our total revenue mix 
business to business 
the company provides a variety of services for business to business bb clients including spanx  napa and the walt disney company 
although we continue to provide services to businesses in this vertical  we expect future revenues in this category to remain a smaller portion of our total business mix

the company s service revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the million increase in service revenues is primarily attributable to i a million increase in our ecommerce vertical primarily due to the addition of several new clients and increased volumes from existing clients  ii a million increase in revenues from our direct marketing vertical due to net increased volumes from existing clients and the addition of two new clients  and iii a  increase in revenues from our bb clients due to addition of a new client  offset by iv a million decrease in revenue from our telecommunications and modem clients due to a decrease in volumes  freight revenues 
the company s freight revenues decreased million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in freight revenues is primarily attributable to two of our direct marketing clients transitioning all or a portion of their freight usage from company owned freight accounts to their own freight accounts  offset by increased volumes from new direct marketing and ecommerce clients and other existing direct marketing and ecommerce clients 
changes between reporting periods in freight revenue do not have a material impact on our operating profitability due to pricing practices for direct freight costs

as discussed in the overview paragraph of this item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we experienced growth in service revenues in compared to and our forecast for includes continued growth in service revenues compared to this past and anticipated growth has required us to increase our fulfillment capacity in by adding an additional facility 
we expect to invest approximately million during in the partial build out of that facility 
additionally  we have several core technology systems which will be upgraded in resulting in  of technology system upgrades 
to maintain our available borrowing capacity under the credit facility for working capital needs  we have committed to a three year capital lease to fund the technology system upgrades and have committed to a million five year equipment term loan with the bank  which loan will be included under the million credit facility 
we project that a substantial portion of our capital expenditures in  including a significant amount of the million to build out the new fulfillment facility in ohio  will occur in the first four months of therefore although we had million of cash at december   we project to have amounts borrowed on our credit facility during the first half of  the amount of which will depend on our operating results  additional new business which would require additional investment and the timing of proceeds from the million equipment loan 
the company estimates that its cash and financing needs through will be met by its available cash at december   cash flows from operations  capital lease financing and availability from its credit facility

the terms of the credit facility provide that the amount borrowed and outstanding at any time combined with certain reserves for rental payments  letters of credit outstanding and general reserves be subtracted from the credit facility limit or the value of the total collateral to arrive at an amount of unused availability to borrow 
the amount available to borrow under the credit facility will increase and decrease mainly as a result of changes in the value of accounts receivable and inventory caused by variations in revenue or the timing of collection of accounts receivable 
our availability to borrow under the credit facility will change from quarter to quarter due to seasonality of our business and revenue fluctuations caused largely by our clients selling cycles which directly affect our accounts receivable and  therefore  our eligible collateral to be higher at the end of the calendar year than the other three calendar quarter periods 
we were in compliance with all financial covenants of the credit facility at december  and march  our seasonal volumes in the fourth quarter can vary widely from expectations and such variations can cause actual results to differ from our forecasts 
since we also project positive cash flow from operations in  we expect the company s existing cash on hand  projected cash flows from operations and availability under the credit facility will satisfy our cash and financing needs for at least the next twelve months 
contractual obligations 
the company s primary long term contractual commitments consist of operating leases 
as of december   the company did not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
in addition  as of december   the company did not participate in any guarantees of other entities obligations  structured finance arrangements  synthetic leases  repurchase obligations or similar commercial or financing commitments 
the following table sets forth the company s contractual commitments by period 
for additional information  see note to the financial statements in s 
payments due by period total less than year years years after years operating leases capital leases line of credit the provisions of the credit facility require that the company maintain a lockbox arrangement with the lender and allow the lender to declare any outstanding borrowing amounts to be immediately due and payable as a result of noncompliance with any of the covenants 
accordingly  in the event of noncompliance  these amounts could be accelerated 
for additional information  including information regarding the interest related to the revolving line of credit  see note critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of our financial position and results of operations and demand the most significant use of subjective estimates and management judgment 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
specific risks inherent in our application of these critical policies are described below 
for all of these policies  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
these policies often require difficult judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance 
additional information concerning our accounting policies can be found in note to our financial statements 
the policies that we believe are critical to an investor s understanding of our financial results and condition and require complex management judgment are discussed below revenue recognition 
innotrac derives its revenue primarily from two sources fulfillment operations and the delivery of business services 
innotrac s fulfillment services operations record revenue at the conclusion of the material selection  packaging and upon completion of the shipping process 
the shipping is considered complete after transfer to an independent freight carrier and receipt of a bill of lading or shipping manifest from that carrier 
innotrac s call center services business recognizes revenue according to written pricing agreements based on number of calls  minutes or hourly rate basis 
all other revenues are recognized as services are rendered 
as required by the consensus reached in asc topic no 
revenue recognition  revenues have been recorded net of the cost of the goods for all fee for service clients and the company records reimbursements received from customers for out of pocket expenses  primarily freight and postage fees  as revenue and the associated expense as cost of revenue 
for two clients we purchase their product from our client s vendor under agreements that require our clients to buy the product back from us at original cost when we ship the product to our client s end consumer or after a period of time if the product has not been shipped from our fulfillment centers 
the value of these products is repaid to us at the same amount as we paid for them and no service fees are generated on the products 
we net the value of the purchase against the reimbursement from our customer with a resulting zero value in our reported revenue and costs of revenue 
reserve for uncollectible accounts 
the company makes estimates each reporting period associated with its reserve for uncollectible accounts 
these estimates are based on the aging of the receivables and known specific facts and circumstances 
accounting for income taxes 
innotrac utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with asc topic no 
under the liability method  deferred taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if the company considers it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized 
innotrac s gross deferred tax asset as of december  is million 
this deferred tax asset was generated primarily by net operating loss carryforwards created in prior years and the goodwill impairment charge of million recorded in innotrac has a net operating loss carryforward of million at december  that expires between and innotrac s ability to generate taxable income from future operations is dependent upon general economic conditions  collection of existing outstanding accounts receivable  competitive pressures on sales and margins and other factors beyond management s control 
these factors  combined with losses in recent years create uncertainty about the ultimate realization of the gross deferred tax asset in future years 
therefore  a valuation allowance of approximately million and million has been recorded as of december  and  respectively against net deferred tax assets 
income taxes associated with future earnings may be offset by a reduction in the valuation allowance in that future year 
for the year ended december   the deferred income tax benefit of  was offset by a corresponding increase of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
when and if the company can return to consistent profitability and management determines that it will be able to utilize the deferred tax assets prior to their expiration  the valuation allowance may be reduced or eliminated 
accounting estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements recently adopted accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued asu to topic presentation of comprehensive income  to allow an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements  consisting of an income statement followed by a separate statement of other comprehensive income 
also  items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income must be presented on the face of the financial statements 
in both choices  an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income  each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income  and a total amount for comprehensive income 
this asu eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
in december  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu which defers certain provisions of asu one provision of asu required entities to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented for both interim and annual financial statements 
this requirement is indefinitely deferred under asu and will be further deliberated by the fasb at a future date 
during the deferral period  all entities are required to comply with existing requirements for reclassification adjustments in accounting standards codification asc  comprehensive income  which indicates that an entity may display reclassification adjustments on the face of the financial statement in which comprehensive income is reported  or it may disclose reclassification adjustments in the notes to the financial statements 
the asu and amendments are to be applied retrospectively and are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company plans to adopt these provisions in the first quarter of adoption of these provisions is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued asu to topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss which provides guidance for required disclosure on fair value measurements  including a consistent meaning of the term fair value  thereby facilitating greater comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap and international financial reporting standards 
the amendments are to be applied prospectively and are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company plans to adopt these provisions in the first quarter of adoption of these provisions is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management believes the company s exposure to market risks investments  interest rates and foreign currency is immaterial 
innotrac holds no market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
at present  the company does not employ any derivative financial instruments and does not currently plan to employ them in the future 
during the years ended december  and  the company did not transact any sales in foreign currency with the first revenues recorded for innotrac europe occurring in the first quarter ended march  to the extent that the company has borrowings outstanding under its credit facility the company will have market risk relating to the amount of borrowings due to variable interest rates under the credit facility 
all of the company s lease obligations are fixed in nature as noted in note to the financial statements  and the company has no long term purchase commitments
