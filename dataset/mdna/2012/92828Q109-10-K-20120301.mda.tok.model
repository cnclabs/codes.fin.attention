item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview our business we are a provider of investment management products and services to individuals and institutions 
we operate a multi manager investment management business  comprised of affiliated managers and unaffiliated sub advisors  each having its own distinct investment style  autonomous investment process and brand 
we believe our customers value this approach  especially institutional customers who appreciate individual managers with distinctive cultures and styles 
investors have an array of needs driven by factors such as market conditions  risk tolerance and investment goals 
a key element of our business is offering a variety of investment styles and multiple disciplines to meet those needs 
to that end  for our mutual funds  we supplement the investment capabilities of our affiliated managers with those of select unaffiliated sub advisors 
we do that by partnering with unaffiliated sub advisors whose strategies we believe appeal to investors and are not typically available to retail mutual fund customers 
we provide our products in a number of forms and through multiple distribution channels 
our retail products include open end mutual funds  closed end funds  variable insurance funds and separately managed accounts 
our fund family of open end funds is distributed primarily through intermediaries 
our closed end funds trade on the new york stock exchange 
our variable insurance trust provides investment options in variable annuities and life insurance products distributed by third party insurance companies 
retail separately managed accounts are comprised of intermediary programs  sponsored and distributed by unaffiliated brokerage firms  and private client accounts  which are offerings to the high net worth clients of our affiliated managers 
we also manage institutional accounts for corporations  multi employer retirement funds  public employee retirement systems  foundations and endowments and special purpose funds 
our earnings are primarily driven by asset based investment management fees charged on these various products 
these fees are based on a percentage of assets under management and are calculated using daily or weekly average assets or assets at the end of the preceding quarter 
market developments the year ended december  marked a year of volatile markets 
the global equity market overall was down for  as evidenced by the msci world index ending the year at  as compared to  from the start of the year 
the major us equity indexes remained relatively flat for amid concerns about unemployment  economic growth and fears surrounding the downgrade of the us treasury debt rating and concerns over european sovereign debt 
the dow jones industrial average ended the year at  from  at the beginning of the year  while the standard poor s index closed out at  the same as the beginning of the year 
changes in our assets under management are driven in great part by the performance of the equity markets 
the financial markets have experienced a period of significant volatility over the past five years  which impacted asset flows and the value of our assets under management 
the capital and financial markets could experience further fluctuation and volatility  which could impact relative investment returns and asset flows among investment products as well as investor choices and preferences among investment products  including equity  fixed income and alternative products 
uncertainties remain about the long term nature of the economic recovery 
the inconsistent nature of the recovery  and the possibility that further economic gains could be disrupted by local or global events such as adverse changes in interest rates  significant shifts in commodity supplies or prices  political unrest  or even government initiatives  could adversely impact interest in our investment products and services and  consequently  revenue and earnings

capital requirements our short term capital requirements  which we consider to be those capital requirements due within one year  include payment of annual incentive compensation  contingent consideration payments for our variable insurance fund investment management contracts and payment of interest on our credit facility 
incentive compensation  which is generally the company s largest annual operating cash payment  is paid in the first quarter of the year 
the company paid approximately million in incentive compensation in the first quarter of related to incentives that were earned during the year ended december  and results would indicate that incentive compensation to be paid in the first quarter of will be higher as compared to what was paid in the first quarter of related to incentives that were earned during the year ended december  short term capital requirements may also be affected by employee withholding tax payments related to net share settlement upon vesting of restricted stock units 
the amount we pay in future periods will vary based on our stock price  the number of restricted stock units vesting during the period and whether we and our employees elect to satisfy withholding taxes through net share settlement 
approximately  restricted stock units are expected to vest by march and april of future capital requirements include principal payments on our outstanding credit facility  which matures in september  capital expenditures and other strategic initiatives 
uses of capital we expect that our main uses of cash will be to i invest in our organic growth  including our distribution efforts or closed end fund launches  ii seed new investment strategies and mutual funds to ensure a strong pipeline of future saleable products  iii fund ongoing and potential investments in our infrastructure to achieve 
table of contents greater economies of scale and a more efficient overall cost structure iv acquire shares of our common stock and v invest in inorganic growth opportunities as they arise 
we anticipate that our available cash  marketable securities and cash expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our expected cash operating requirements and other capital requirements in the short term  which we consider to be the next twelve months 
our ability to meet our future cash needs will depend upon our future operating performance and the level and mix of assets under management  as well as general economic conditions 
current or unexpected events that could require additional liquidity may occur affecting our results of operations  access to financing and generation of cash 
should assets under management decline for any reason  revenues  operating income  net income and cash flow would be negatively impacted

in addition  the credit facility contains certain financial covenants  the most restrictive of which include  effective august  i minimum required consolidated net worth as of any fiscal quarter end total stockholders equity plus the liquidation preference of outstanding convertible preferred shares to be at least million  plus adjustments for net income  redemptions of convertible securities and equity issuances  if any  after september   ii minimum consolidated assets under management excluding money market funds of billion as of each quarter end through march  and billion as of any quarter end thereafter  iii minimum liquid assets having a fair value not less than million  iv a minimum interest coverage ratio generally  adjusted ebitda to interest expense as defined in and for the period specified in the credit facility agreement of at least  and v a leverage ratio generally  total indebtedness as of any date to adjusted ebitda as defined in and for the period specified in the credit facility agreement of no greater than for purposes of the credit facility  adjusted ebitda generally means  for any period  net income of the company before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization expense  and excluding non cash stock based compensation  unrealized mark to market gains and losses  certain severance  and certain non cash non recurring gains and losses as described in and specified under the credit facility agreement 
at december   the company was in compliance with all financial covenants 
the credit facility agreement also contains customary provisions regarding events of default which could result in an acceleration of amounts due under the facility  including failure to pay principal or interest when due  failure to satisfy or comply with covenants  change of control  certain judgments  invalidation of liens  and cross default to other debt obligations 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  payments due in millions total less than year years years more than years lease obligations credit facility  including interest vit contingent consideration total at december   the company has million outstanding under the credit facility that has a variable interest rate 
amounts outstanding under the credit facility bear interest at an annual rate equal to  at the company s option  either libor for interest periods of   or months or an alternate base rate  plus an applicable margin that ranges from to 
at december   the interest rate in effect for the credit facility was 
payments due are estimated based on the interest rate of in effect on december  on november   the company acquired the rights to advise and distribute the former phoenix edge series funds excluding certain of the funds to be merged into a third party variable insurance trust from phoenix variable advisors  inc pva 
under the terms of the agreement  during the three years following the closing  the company is required to make quarterly payments to pva based upon fixed percentages of the average assets under management 
these payments are variable and will fluctuate based on assets under management  influenced by asset flows and market impact 
the payments reflected are

critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements and the accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which requires the use of estimates 
actual results will vary from these estimates 
management believes the following critical accounting policies are important to understanding our results of operations and financial position 
goodwill as of december   the carrying amount of goodwill was million 
goodwill represents the excess of purchase price of acquisitions over the fair value of identified net assets and liabilities acquired 
for goodwill  impairment tests for the company are performed annually  or more frequently  should circumstances change which would indicate the fair value of goodwill is below its carrying amount 
we have determined that the company has only one reporting unit 
in september  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  testing goodwill for impairment the revised standard which amends the rules for testing goodwill for impairment 
under the new rules  an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  an entity determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
we early adopted asu for our annual goodwill impairment test 
in assessing the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  we assess relevant events and circumstances that may impact the fair value and the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
the identification of relevant events and circumstances and how these may impact a reporting units fair value or carrying amount involve significant judgments and assumptions 
the judgment and assumptions include the identification of macroeconomic conditions  industry and market considerations  cost factors  overall financial performance  company specific events and share price trends and making the assessment on whether each relevant factor will impact the impairment test positively or negatively and the magnitude of any such impact 

table of contents based upon our fiscal qualitative impairment analysis  prepared in accordance with asu  we concluded that there was no requirement to do a quantitative annual goodwill impairment test 
the key qualitative factors that led to our conclusion were i that our fiscal impairment analysis indicated that the fair value of our reporting unit significantly exceeded the carrying amount  ii the significant increase in our share price and market capitalization since our fiscal annual goodwill impairment analysis  and iii that we continue to show positive financial performance 
no impairment had been identified or recorded by the company for the year ended december  significant deterioration in markets or declines in revenue or in the value of the company could result in future impairment charges 
indefinite lived intangible assets as of december   the carrying values of indefinite lived intangible assets were million 
indefinite lived intangible assets are comprised of acquired  closed end fund investment advisory contracts 
indefinite lived intangible asset impairment tests are performed annually  or more frequently should circumstances change which would reduce the fair value below its carrying value 
the company estimated fair value of intangible assets using a discounted cash flow analysis 
management believes a discounted cash flow analysis is most appropriate in valuing the indefinite lived intangible assets because it has concluded that it is a likely method that would be utilized by market participants 
the key variables impacting the valuation of the intangible assets under this model include the discount rate  fee rates and assets under management related to the relevant investment advisory contracts 
for the year ended december   there was no indefinite lived intangible asset impairments as the estimated fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets was substantially in excess of its carrying value 
there were improvements in key valuation assumptions used in management s valuation as compared to the prior year 
for our annual impairment test performed as of october   the discount rate applied in the calculation used by the company was  based on an estimated cost of capital that reflected the economic conditions at that time 
the company performed a sensitivity analysis that showed that a discount rate of more than and a more than decrease in assets under management underlying these investment advisory contracts would result in an impairment charge as of october  no impairment had been identified or recorded by the company for the years ended december  and  respectively 
significant deterioration in markets or declines in revenue or in the value of the company could result in future impairment charges 
definite lived intangible assets as of december   the carrying values of definite lived intangible assets were million 
definite lived intangible assets are comprised of acquired investment advisory contracts 
the company monitors the useful lives of definite lived intangible assets and revises the useful lives  if necessary  based on the circumstances 
significant judgment is required in estimating the period that these assets will contribute to our cash flows and the pattern over which these assets will be consumed 
a change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets could have a significant impact on our amortization expense 
all amortization expense has been  and continues to be  calculated on a straight line basis 
for definite lived intangible assets  impairment testing is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if the company determines the carrying value of the definite lived intangible assets is less than the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the asset we will quantify the impairment using a discounted cash flow model 

table of contents the key assumptions in the discounted cash flow model include  the estimated remaining useful life of the intangible asset  the discount rate  investment management fee rates on assets under management  and the market expense ratio factor 
during the years ended december   and  no events or circumstances occurred that indicated the carrying value of definite lived intangible assets might be impaired and therefore no impairment tests were performed during these periods 
significant deterioration in markets or declines in revenue or in the value of the company could result in future impairment charges 
revenue recognition investment management fees  distribution and service fees and administration and transfer agent fees are recorded as revenue during the period in which services are performed 
investment management fees  which are accrued monthly  are earned based upon a percentage of assets under management  and are paid pursuant to the terms of the respective investment management contracts  which generally require monthly or quarterly payment 
management fees for structured finance products  such as cdos  that accrue as services are rendered  but are subordinated to other interests and payable only if certain financial criteria of the underlying collateral are met  are recorded as revenue when the structured finance products are in compliance with required financial criteria and collectability is reasonably assured 
the company accounts for investment management fees in accordance with asc  revenue recognition  and has recorded its management fees net of fees paid to unaffiliated advisors 
amounts paid to unaffiliated sub advisors for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
investment management fees are calculated based on our assets under management 
we rely on data provided to us by mutual funds and custodians in the pricing of assets under management  which are not reflected within our consolidated financial statements 
the boards of our mutual funds and management of custodians of the assets we manage have formal pricing policies and procedures over pricing of investments 
given our reliance on the data provided to us by the mutual funds and the custodians in the pricing of the assets under management  management has established internal procedures to corroborate that mutual fund and custodial pricing appears adequate and has implemented processes to ensure valuation discrepancies are investigated and resolved 
as of december   our total assets under management by fair value hierarchy level as defined by asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  was approximately level  level and level gross investment management fees earned on long term open end mutual funds range from to of average assets under management  depending on the type of fund 
investment management fees earned on closed end funds range from to of average assets under management 
investment management fees earned on money market funds range from to of average assets under management 
investment management fees earned on separately managed accounts and institutional accounts are negotiated and are based primarily on asset size  portfolio complexity and individual needs and range from to 
investment management fees earned on variable insurance funds range from to of average assets under management 
investment management fees earned on structured finance products range from to of the principal outstanding 
distribution and service fees are earned based on a percentage of assets under management and are paid monthly pursuant to the terms of the respective distribution and service fee contracts 
underwriter fees are sales based charges on sales of certain class a share mutual funds 
administration and transfer agent fees consist of fund administration fees  transfer agent fees and fiduciary fees 
fund administration fees are earned based on the average daily assets in the funds 
transfer agent fees are earned based on the average daily assets in the funds 
fiduciary fees are recorded monthly based on the number of k accounts 
the company utilizes outside service providers to perform some of the functions related to 
table of contents fund administration and transfer agent services 
effective january   a new fund administration agreement was executed with our open end mutual funds 
under the prior agreement  the fees  which covered all fund administration services  were paid directly to the company by the funds and were recorded as revenue 
a portion of the fees received by the company were remitted to third party service providers for services performed on behalf of the funds  and were recorded as a distribution and administration expense 
as a result of the new agreement  the funds now directly contract for the third party services and fees paid by the funds directly to the service providers are not reflected as either revenue or expenses of the company 
for the year ended december   million of payments to third party service providers were recorded as revenue and expense of the company 
for the year ended december  transfer agent fees  which were previously reported net of payments to third party service providers  were million 
other income and fees consist primarily of redemption income on the early redemption of class b share mutual funds and brokerage commissions and fees earned for the distribution of nonaffiliated products 
commissions earned and related expenses are recorded on a trade date basis and are computed based upon contractual agreements 
accounting for income taxes in  the company recorded a deferred tax asset and corresponding valuation allowance for a capital loss carryforward in the amount of approximately million related to the dissolution of an inactive subsidiary 
during  the company submitted a request for a private letter ruling plr to the internal revenue service irs to allow the capital loss to be claimed as an ordinary loss 
during the year ended december   the irs issued a favorable plr to the company 
as a result of the favorable plr  the company recharacterized the million of deferred tax assets previously reported as capital in character to million in deferred tax assets relating to net operating losses and intangible assets  with million being rendered not utilizable due to internal revenue code section limitations 
the plr relies on certain facts  assumptions and representations from management regarding the past conduct of the company s businesses and other matters 
if any of these facts  assumptions or representations about the existence of a deductible loss are successfully challenged by the irs  the company could be subject to significant tax liabilities to the extent the reported loss represented an incremental reduction to the company s tax liability in any given year 
notwithstanding the plr  the irs could also recharacterize the ordinary loss as a capital loss should it successfully challenge the validity of the facts  assumptions  or representations made as part of the plr request 
significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and  in particular  any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
our methodology for determining the realizability of deferred tax assets involves estimates of future taxable income from our operations and consideration of available tax planning strategies and actions that would be implemented by us  if necessary  as well as the expiration dates and amounts of carryforwards related to net operating losses and capital losses 
these estimates are projected through the life of the related deferred tax assets based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable and consistent with demonstrated operating results 
the projection also includes consideration of the reversal of deferred tax liabilities that are in the same period and jurisdiction and are of the same character as the temporary differences that gave rise to the deferred tax assets 
changes in future operating results not currently forecasted may have a significant impact on the realization of deferred tax assets 
at each reporting date  the company evaluates the positive and negative evidence used to determine the likelihood of realization of all its deferred tax assets 
prior to december   the company maintained a valuation allowance on substantially all of its net deferred tax assets as prior to that date  the company determined that the likelihood of realization of those assets were less than more likely than not 
during  the company determined that its recent historical operating results and future projections gave rise to sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that a substantial portion of its deferred tax assets would be realizable 
as a result  the company released a valuation allowance of million during the year 
table of contents ended december  the company maintained a valuation allowance in the amount of million at december  relating to deferred tax assets on items of a capital nature as well as certain state deferred tax assets where the company determined that at the current level of projected taxable income the realization of such assets prior to statutory expiration continued to be less than more likely than not 
offsetting the valuation allowance release was million related to the recording of an uncertain tax position and million in deferred tax assets that were rendered not utilizable due to internal revenue code section  both related to the receipt of a private letter ruling in concerning the treatment of a loss related to the dissolution of an inactive subsidiary 
also offsetting the benefit of the valuation allowance release was million of tax expense on current year operations 
uncertain tax positions taken by the company are accounted for under asc  income taxes  which may require certain benefits taken on a tax return to not be recognized in the financial statements when there are the potential for certain tax positions to be successfully challenged by the taxing authorities 
loss contingencies the likelihood that a loss contingency exists is evaluated using the criteria of asc  loss contingencies  and an accrued liability is recorded if the likelihood of a loss is considered both probable and reasonably estimable at the date of the financial statements 
we believe that we have considered relevant circumstances that we may be currently subject to  and the financial statements accurately reflect our reasonable estimate of the results of our operations  financial condition and cash flows for the years presented 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk our exposure to market risk is directly related to our role as investment advisor for the funds and accounts we manage as investment advisor 
substantially all of our revenue for the three years ended december  was derived from investment management  distribution and fund administration fees  which are typically based on the market value of assets under management 
accordingly  a decline in the prices of securities would cause our revenue and income to decline due to a decrease in the value of the assets we manage 
in addition  such a decline could cause our clients to withdraw their funds in favor of investments offering higher returns or lower risk  which would cause our revenue and income to decline further 
we are also subject to market risk due to a decline in the market value of our investments  consisting primarily of marketable securities 
at december   the fair value of marketable securities was million 
assuming a increase or decrease in the fair value of marketable securities at december   our net income would change by million and our total comprehensive income would change by million for the year ended december  interest rate risk at december   the company has million outstanding under the credit facility that has a variable interest rate 
amounts outstanding under the credit facility bear interest at an annual rate equal to  at the company s option  either libor for interest periods of   or months or an alternate base rate  plus an applicable margin that ranges from to 
at december   the interest rate in effect for the credit facility was 
a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates for the year ended december  would have changed our interest expense by approximately million
