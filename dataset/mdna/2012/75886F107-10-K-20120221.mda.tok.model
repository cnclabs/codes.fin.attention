arcalyst is a protein based product designed to bind the interleukin called il cytokine and prevent its interaction with cell surface receptors 
arcalyst is available by prescription in the united states for the treatment of caps  including fcas and mws in adults and children and older 
caps are a group of rare  inherited  auto inflammatory conditions characterized by life long  recurrent symptoms of rash  fever chills  joint pain  eye redness pain  and fatigue 
intermittent  disruptive exacerbations or flares can be triggered at any time by exposure to cooling temperatures  stress  exercise  or other unknown stimuli 
clinical programs eylea ophthalmologic diseases we  together with our ex us collaborator bayer healthcare  are evaluating eylea in phase programs in patients with central retinal vein occlusion crvo  diabetic macular edema dme  and choroidal neovascularisation cnv of the retina as a result of pathologic myopia 
we plan on initiating a phase study in branch retinal vein occlusion brvo in the first quarter of wet amd  diabetic retinopathy which includes dme  and retinal vein occlusion are three of the leading causes of adult blindness in the developed world 
in these conditions  severe visual loss is caused by a combination of retinal edema and neovascular proliferation 
the phase trials in wet amd  known as view and view vegf trap investigation of efficacy and safety in wet age related macular degeneration  compared eylea and lucentis ranibizumab injection  a registered trademark of genentech  inc lucentis is an anti vegf agent approved for use and the current standard of care in wet amd 
view was conducted in north america and view was conducted in europe  asia pacific  japan  and latin america 
the view and view trials both evaluated eylea doses of milligrams mg and mg at dosing intervals of four weeks and mg at a dosing interval of eight weeks following three initial monthly doses  compared with lucentis dosed according to its us label  which specifies doses of mg administered every four weeks over the first year 
the primary endpoint of these non inferiority studies was the proportion of patients treated with eylea who maintain visual acuity at the end of one year compared to patients dosed monthly with lucentis 
visual acuity is defined as the total number of letters read correctly on the early treatment diabetic retinopathy study etdrs chart  a standard research tool for measuring visual acuity 
maintenance of vision is defined as losing fewer than three lines equivalent to letters on the etdrs chart 
secondary endpoints included the mean change from baseline in visual acuity as measured by etdrs  the proportion of patients who gained at least letters of vision at week  and the amount of fluid under the retina 
we and bayer healthcare announced week results from the view and view studies in november in these studies  all regimens of eylea  including eylea dosed every two months  successfully met the primary endpoint of statistical non inferiority compared to lucentis dosed every month 
a generally favorable safety profile was observed for both eylea and lucentis 
the incidence of ocular treatment emergent adverse events was balanced across all four treatment groups in both studies  with the most frequent events associated with the injection procedure  the underlying disease  and or the aging process 
the most frequent ocular adverse events were conjunctival hemorrhage  macular degeneration  eye pain  retinal hemorrhage  and vitreous floaters 
the most frequent serious non ocular adverse events were typical of those reported in this elderly population who receive intravitreal treatment for wet amd  the most frequently reported events were falls  pneumonia  myocardial infarction  atrial fibrillation  breast cancer  and acute coronary syndrome 
there were no notable differences among the study arms 
based on these positive results  we submitted a biologics license application bla to the fda in february for marketing approval of eylea in wet amd in the united states 
in april  the fda accepted the bla for filing and granted our request for priority review 
in june  the dermatologic and ophthalmic drugs advisory committee of the fda unanimously recommended that the fda approve our bla 
in  bayer healthcare submitted regulatory applications for marketing approval of eylea in wet amd in the european union  japan  and other countries 
in november  we received us marketing approval from the fda for eylea injection for the treatment of patients with wet amd 
in december  we and bayer healthcare announced year results from the view and view studies 
in the second year of the studies  patients were treated with the same dose per injection as in the first year and were evaluated monthly to determine need for retreatment 
patients were treated at least every weeks 
all year analyses were considered exploratory 
in an integrated analysis of the view and view studies  the visual acuity gain from baseline in the eylea mg every eight week group at week was letters compared to letters at week  with an average of injections over two years and injections during the second year 
the visual acuity gain from baseline in the monthly lucentis group at week was letters compared to letters at week  with an average of injections over two years and injections during the second year 
the results of each of the view and view studies were consistent with the integrated analysis 
the overall fewer average number of injections in the second year in the eylea mg every eight week group compared to the lucentis group versus  nominal p was driven by the fact that fewer patients needed more intense therapy in the eylea group and those patients required fewer injections 
the proportion of patients who required frequent injections six or more during year was lower in the eylea mg every eight week group compared to the lucentis group versus 
in the of patients who required the most intense therapy the greatest number of injections  patients in the eylea mg every eight week group required an average of fewer injections in year compared to the lucentis group versus 
in the of patients in each group who had the fewest number of injections in year  the average number of injections was similar approximately for both groups  corresponding to the protocol mandated minimum number of injections 
a generally favorable safety profile was observed for both eylea and lucentis 
the incidence of ocular treatment emergent adverse events was balanced across all four treatment groups in both studies 
the most frequent ocular adverse events greater than of patients for the overall study population were conjunctival hemorrhage  eye pain  retinal hemorrhage  and visual acuity reduced 
the most frequent serious non ocular adverse events were typical of those reported in this elderly population who receive intravitreal treatment for wet amd  the most frequently reported events greater than of patients for the overall study population were falls  pneumonia  myocardial infarction and atrial fibrillation 
there were no notable differences among the study arms 
the incidence of arterial thrombotic events as defined by the anti platelet trialists group criteria was of patients for lucentis and of patients in the combined eylea groups 
in the fourth quarter of  we and bayer healthcare initiated a phase trial  known as sight  evaluating the efficacy and safety of eylea in the neovascular form of wet amd in china 
eylea will be evaluated for its effect on improving and maintaining vision when dosed as an intravitreal injection on a schedule of mg every two months following three initial monthly doses  as compared with photodynamic therapy pdt with verteporfin 
after assessment of the primary endpoint at week  all patients  including those on pdt  will receive eylea treatment until the end of the study at week the trial will include approximately patients and will be the largest retinal trial conducted in china 
the sight trial is being led by bayer healthcare 
eylea was also in phase clinical studies for the treatment of crvo  another cause of visual impairment 
we led the copernicus controlled phase evaluation of repeated intravitreal administration of vegf trap eye in central retinal vein occlusion utility and safety study  and bayer healthcare led the galileo general assessment limiting infiltration of exudates in central retinal vein occlusion with vegf trap eye study 
patients in both studies received six monthly intravitreal injections of either eylea at a dose of mg or sham control injections 
the primary endpoint of both studies was improvement in visual acuity versus baseline after six months of treatment as measured by the etdrs eye chart 
at the end of the initial six months  patients were dosed on an as needed prn basis for another six months 
all patients were eligible for rescue laser treatment 
in the copernicus study  patients who were randomized to sham injections in the first six months were eligible to cross over to eylea prn dosing in the second six months 
in december  we and bayer healthcare announced that in the copernicus study  eylea demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in visual acuity at six months compared to sham injections  the primary endpoint of the study 
in this study  of patients receiving eylea gained at least letters of vision from baseline  compared to of patients receiving sham injections p 
in the study  eylea was generally well tolerated 
the most common adverse events were those typically associated with intravitreal injections or the underlying disease 
serious ocular adverse events in the eylea group were uncommon  consisting of individual reports of corneal abrasion  endophalmitis  retinal vein occlusion  and reduced visual acuity  and were more frequent in the control group 
the incidence of non ocular serious adverse events was generally well balanced between the treatment arms 
there were no deaths among the patients treated with eylea and two in the patients treated with sham injections 
the one year copernicus results showed that of patients receiving eylea dosed monthly for weeks  then on a prn basis guided by anatomic and visual acuity monitoring over the next weeks  gained at least letters from baseline on an etdrs eye chart compared to of patients who received sham injections for the first weeks followed by eylea prn from week to week p 
in terms of gain in visual acuity from baseline to week  patients receiving eylea monthly for weeks followed by eylea prn gained  on average  letters of vision compared to a mean gain of letters for patients who switched at week from sham to eylea prn p 
these results demonstrate that the benefits achieved with monthly eylea treatment through week were maintained out to week at week  patients receiving eylea had a mean gain of letters  while patients receiving sham had a mean loss of letters p 
patients who received eylea monthly followed by eylea prn  were administered a mean of eylea injections from week to  while patients who switched from sham to eylea prn received a mean of eylea injections 
eylea was generally well tolerated in the study 
at week  the most frequently reported adverse events in patients who went from monthly eylea to eylea prn were reduction of visual acuity  conjunctival hemorrhage  eye pain  and intraocular pressure increased 
the most frequently reported adverse events in patients who switched from sham to eylea prn were reduction of visual acuity  conjunctival hemorrhage  intraocular pressure increased  and retinal hemorrhage 
at week  of patients receiving eylea who switched to eylea prn and of patients who switched from sham to eylea prn reported at least one ocular serious adverse event 
in april  we and bayer healthcare announced that in the galileo study  eylea also demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in visual acuity at six months compared to sham injections  the primary endpoint of the study 
in this trial  of patients receiving mg of eylea monthly gained at least letters of vision from baseline  compared to of patients receiving sham injections p 
patients receiving mg of eylea monthly gained  on average  letters of vision compared to a mean gain of letters with sham injections p  a secondary endpoint 
as in the copernicus trial  eylea was generally well tolerated in the galileo study and the most common adverse events were those typically associated with intravitreal injections or the underlying disease 
serious ocular adverse events in the eylea group were and were more frequent in the control group 
the most frequently reported adverse events overall in the eylea arm were eye pain  conjunctival hemorrhage  and elevated intraocular pressure 
the most frequently reported adverse events in the control group were macular edema  eye irritation  and reduced visual acuity 
the incidence of non ocular serious adverse events was generally well balanced between the treatment arms 
the most frequent non ocular adverse events were headache and nasopharyngitis 
there were no deaths in the study 
the one year galileo results showed that of patients receiving eylea dosed monthly for weeks  then on a prn basis guided by anatomic and visual acuity monitoring over the next weeks  gained at least letters from baseline on an etdrs eye chart compared to of patients receiving sham injections p 
in terms of gain in visual acuity from baseline to week  patients receiving eylea gained  on average  letters of vision compared to a mean gain of letters for patients receiving sham injections p 
these results demonstrate that the benefits achieved with monthly eylea treatment through week were maintained out to week at week  patients receiving eylea had a mean gain of letters compared to a mean gain of letters for patients with sham injections p 
patients treated with eylea received an average of eylea injections from week to week eylea was generally well tolerated in the study 
at week  the most frequently reported adverse events overall in the eylea arm were macular edema  elevated intraocular pressure  eye pain  conjunctival hemorrhage  and retinal hemorrhage 
the most frequently reported adverse events in the sham group were macular edema  retinal hemorrhage  retinal vascular disorder  reduction of visual acuity and eye irritation 
at week  of patients in the eylea arm and of patients in the sham arm presented with at least one ocular serious adverse event 
based on the positive six month results in the copernicus and galileo studies  we submitted a supplemental bla for us regulatory approval of eylea in crvo in november under the prescription drug user fee act pdufa  we were granted a target date for an fda decision on our eylea supplemental bla of september  bayer healthcare plans to submit regulatory applications in this indication in europe in late or early in the second quarter of  we and bayer healthcare initiated phase studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of eylea in dme 
these clinical trials have three study arms 
in the first arm  patients will be treated every month with mg of eylea 
in the second arm  patients will be treated with mg of eylea every two months after an initial phase of monthly injections 
in the third arm  the comparator arm  patients will be treated with macular laser photocoagulation 
the primary endpoint of the study is mean change in visual acuity from baseline as measured by the etdrs eye chart 
all patients will be followed for three years 
we are conducting one of these studies  called vista dme vegf trap eye investigation of safety  treatment effect  and anatomic outcomes in dme  with study centers in the united states 
bayer healthcare is conducting the second study  named vivid dme vegf trap eye in vision impairment due to dme  with study centers in europe  japan  and australia 
the vista dme trial was fully enrolled in early in the first quarter of  we and bayer healthcare initiated a phase trial in asia in collaboration with the singapore eye research institute seri investigating the efficacy and safety of eylea in patients with cnv of the retina as a result of pathologic myopia 
the study  which will enroll approximately patients  has started in japan and is scheduled to run until june in the first quarter of  we plan to initiate a multinational study of eylea in patients with brvo vibrant 
collaboration with bayer healthcare in october  we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with bayer healthcare for the global development and commercialization outside the united states of eylea 
under the agreement  we and bayer healthcare collaborate on  and share the costs of  the development of eylea through an integrated global plan 
bayer healthcare will market eylea outside the united states  where the companies will share equally in profits from any future sales of eylea 
commencing on the first commercial sale of eylea in a major market country outside the united states  we will be obligated to reimburse bayer healthcare for of the development costs that it has incurred under the agreement from our share of the collaboration profits 
the reimbursement payment in any quarter will equal of the then outstanding repayment obligation  but never more than our share of the collaboration profits in the quarter unless we elect to reimburse bayer healthcare at a faster rate 
within the united states  we retain exclusive commercialization rights to eylea and are entitled to all profits from any such sales 
we have received million in development milestone payments and can earn up to million in future milestone payments related to marketing approvals of eylea in major market countries outside the united states 
we can also earn up to million in sales milestone payments if total annual sales of eylea outside the united states achieve certain specified levels starting at million 
zaltrap aflibercept also known as vegf trap oncology zaltrap aflibercept is a fusion protein that is designed to bind all forms of vegf a  vegf b  and plgf  and prevent their interaction with cell surface receptors 
vegf a and to a lesser degree  plgf is required for the growth of new blood vessels a process known as angiogenesis that are needed for tumors to grow 
zaltrap is being developed globally in cancer indications in collaboration with sanofi 
in april  we and sanofi announced that the phase velour trial evaluating zaltrap in combination with the folfiri chemotherapy regimen 
folinic acid leucovorin  fluorouracil  and irinotecan 
versus a regimen of folfiri plus placebo met its primary endpoint of improving overall survival os in previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer mcrc patients 
the velour data were presented in june at the european society of medical oncology world congress on gastrointestinal cancer 
in this study  the addition of zaltrap to the folfiri chemotherapy regimen significantly improved both overall survival hr  p and progression free survival hr  p compared to folfiri plus placebo 
a similar effect was seen with zaltrap therapy whether or not patients had received prior bevacizumab therapy 
in the velour study  grade or adverse events that occurred with a more than two percent greater incidence in the zaltrap arm than in the placebo arm included diarrhea  asthenia fatigue  stomatitis ulceration  infections  hypertension  gi abdominal pains  neutropenia  neutropenic complications and proteinuria 
deaths on study treatment due to adverse events occurred in percent of patients in the zaltrap arm and in percent of patients in the placebo arm 
based upon these positive findings  sanofi submitted regulatory applications for marketing approval of zaltrap for the treatment of previously treated mcrc patients to the european medicines agency ema in december  and to the fda in early february another randomized  double blind phase trial venice  which is fully enrolled  is evaluating zaltrap as a first line treatment for hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer in combination with docetaxel prednisone 
the venice trial is being monitored by an independent data monitoring committee idmc  a body of independent clinical and statistical experts 
the idmcs meet periodically to evaluate data from the trial and may recommend changes in study design or study discontinuation 
in july  the study s idmc met for a scheduled interim analysis and recommended that the trial continue to completion 
a final analysis will be conducted when a pre specified number of events have occurred in this trial  which is anticipated in the second quarter of in december  we announced initial data from the phase affirm study in the first line mcrc setting of zaltrap in combination with the modified folfox 
folinic acid leucovorin  fluorouracil  and oxaliplatin 
chemotherapy regimen 
the primary endpoint of the study was the progression free survival pfs rate at one year 
the results showed that in patients who received zaltrap  the pfs rate at one year was similar to that seen in the standard therapy arm for patients who received modified folfox alone 
the study was not designed for a direct statistical comparison between arms 
the control arm was used as an internal benchmark only 
the side effect profile of zaltrap was similar to what has been seen in prior trials with zaltrap 
zaltrap collaboration with sanofi we and sanofi globally collaborate on the development and commercialization of zaltrap 
under the terms of our september collaboration agreement  as amended  we and sanofi will share co promotion rights and profits on sales  if any  of zaltrap outside of japan for disease indications included in our collaboration 
in japan  we are entitled to a royalty of approximately on annual sales of zaltrap  subject to certain potential adjustments 
we may also receive up to million in milestone payments upon receipt of specified marketing approvals  including up to million related to the receipt of marketing approvals for up to eight zaltrap oncology and other indications in the united states or the european union and up to million related to the receipt of marketing approvals for up to five oncology indications in japan 
under the zaltrap collaboration agreement  as amended  agreed upon worldwide development expenses incurred by both companies during the term of the agreement will be funded by sanofi 
if the collaboration becomes profitable  we will be obligated to reimburse sanofi out of our share of zaltrap profits for of the development expenses that they funded 
the reimbursement payment in any quarter will equal of the then outstanding repayment obligation  but never more than our share of the zaltrap profits in the quarter unless we elect to reimburse sanofi at a faster rate 
arcalyst rilonacept inflammatory diseases arcalyst is being developed for the prevention of gout flares in patients initiating uric acid lowering therapy 
gout  a disease in which il may play an important role in pain and inflammation  is a very painful and common form of arthritis that results from high levels of uric acid  a bodily waste product normally excreted by the kidneys 
the elevated uric acid can lead to formation of urate crystals in the joints of the toes  ankles  knees  wrists  fingers  and elbows 
uric acid lowering therapy  most commonly allopurinol  is prescribed to eliminate the urate crystals and prevent them from reforming 
paradoxically  the initiation of uric acid lowering therapy often triggers an increase in the frequency of gout attacks in the first several months of treatment  which may lead to discontinuation of therapy 
the break up of urate crystals can result in stimulation of inflammatory mediators  including il  resulting in acute flares of joint pain and inflammation 
these painful flares generally persist for at least five days 
we conducted a phase clinical development program with arcalyst in gout patients initiating uric acid lowering therapy 
the program consisted of three studies pre surge prevention study against urate lowering drug induced gout exacerbations  pre surge  and re surge review of safety utilizing rilonacept in gout exacerbations 
in june  we announced that results from pre surge  a north america based double blind  placebo controlled study  showed that arcalyst prevented gout attacks  as measured by the primary study endpoint of the number of gout flares per patient over the week treatment period 
in addition  all secondary endpoints of the study were positive p vs 
placebo 
among these endpoints  treatment with arcalyst reduced the proportion of patients who experienced two or more flares during the study period by up to 
treatment with arcalyst also reduced the proportion of patients who experienced at least one gout flare during the study period by up to 
in february  we reported the results of pre surge and re surge 
in the pre surge efficacy study in gout patients initiating allopurinol therapy  which was identical to pre surge in design and analysis  patients were randomized 
arcalyst met the primary and all secondary study endpoints 
the primary endpoint was the number of gout flares per patient over the week treatment period 
patients who received arcalyst at a weekly  self administered  subcutaneous dose of either mg or mg had a decrease in mean number of gout flares compared to the placebo group p 
among secondary endpoints  treatment with arcalyst reduced the proportion of patients who experienced two or more flares during the study period by up to 
in addition  treatment with arcalyst reduced the proportion of patients who experienced at least one gout flare during the study period by up to 
we also announced that in the re surge study  which evaluated the safety of arcalyst versus placebo over weeks  arcalyst was generally well tolerated  and the safety profile was consistent with that reported in the pre surge and pre surge studies 
in the overall gout program  the most frequently reported adverse events were injection site reaction and headache 
in the re surge study  arcalyst also met all secondary endpoints  which evaluated efficacy  over the week treatment period p 
these included the number of gout flares per patient  the proportion of patients who experienced two or more flares  and the proportion of patients who experienced at least one gout flare during the study period 
based on the results of the three phase studies  we submitted a supplemental bla for us regulatory approval of arcalyst for the prevention of gout flares in patients initiating uric acid lowering therapy 
in november  the fda accepted for review our supplemental bla 
under pdufa  we were granted a target date for an fda decision on the arcalyst supplemental bla of july  we also initiated a long term safety study in this setting  known as upsurge understanding long term safety in a preventative study against urate lowering drug induced gout exacerbations  during the fourth quarter of we own worldwide rights to arcalyst 
sarilumab regn  il r antibody for inflammatory diseases il is a key cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis  causing inflammation and joint destruction 
a therapeutic antibody to il r  actemra tocilizumab  a registered trademark of chugai seiyaku kabushiki kaisha  has been approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis 
sarilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody to il r generated using our velocimmune technology 
in july  we and sanofi announced that in the phase b stage of the mobility trial in rheumatoid arthritis  patients treated with sarilumab in combination with a standard ra treatment  methotrexate mtx  achieved a significant and clinically meaningful improvement in signs and symptoms of moderate to severe ra compared to patients treated with mtx alone 
the phase b stage of the mobility study was a patient  dose ranging  multi national  randomized  multi arm  double blind  placebo controlled study  that compared five different dose regimens of sarilumab in combination with mtx to placebo plus mtx 
the primary endpoint of the study was the proportion of patients achieving at least a improvement in ra symptoms acr after weeks 
in the phase b stage of the mobility trial  there was a dose response observed in patients receiving sarilumab in combination with mtx 
an acr response after weeks was seen in of patients receiving the lowest sarilumab dose regimen and of patients receiving the highest dose regimen compared to of patients receiving placebo and mtx p  corrected for multiplicity  for the highest sarilumab dose regimen 
the most common adverse events reported more frequently in active treatment arms included infections non serious  neutropenia  and liver function test abnormalities 
the types and frequencies of adverse events were consistent with those previously reported with il inhibition 
the incidence of serious adverse events among the five sarilumab treatment groups and the placebo group was comparable 
sarilumab also demonstrated significant benefit compared to placebo in secondary endpoints  including acr  acr  and disease activity score das scores  additional measures of clinical activity used in ra trials 
in july  we and sanofi announced that in the phase b align trial in ankylosing spondylitis as  sarilumab did not demonstrate significant improvements in the signs and symptoms of active as compared to placebo in patients who had inadequate response to non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids 
sarilumab was generally well tolerated 
the most common adverse events reported more frequently in active treatment arms included infections and neutropenia 
during the third quarter of  we and sanofi initiated the phase stage of the phase mobility study 
regn pcsk antibody for ldl cholesterol reduction elevated ldl cholesterol bad cholesterol level is a validated risk factor leading to cardiovascular disease 
statins are a class of drugs that lower ldl cholesterol by upregulating the expression of the ldl receptor ldlr  which removes ldl from circulation 
pcsk is a naturally occurring secreted protein that also modulates ldl cholesterol levels through its interaction with the ldl receptor 
in a landmark study published in the new england journal of medicine in march  patients with lower than normal pcsk levels due to a genetic abnormality not only had significantly lower levels of ldl cholesterol  but also a significant reduction in the risk of coronary heart disease 
we used our velocimmune technology to generate a fully human monoclonal antibody inhibitor of pcsk  called regn  that is intended to lower ldl cholesterol 
in may  we announced that in an interim efficacy analysis of a dose escalating  randomized  double blind  placebo controlled  phase trial in healthy volunteers  regn achieved substantial  dose dependent decreases of ldl cholesterol 
each dosing cohort consisted of six treated and two placebo patients 
in july  we presented additional data from this phase program 
at the highest intravenous dose tested  a single dose of regn achieved a greater than maximum mean reduction of ldl cholesterol from baseline that lasted for more than one month 
at the highest subcutaneous dose tested  a single dose of regn achieved a greater than maximum mean reduction of ldl cholesterol from baseline that lasted for more than two weeks 
in these early trials  regn was generally safe and well tolerated with no trend in drug related adverse events and no evidence of hepato or myo toxicity 
injection site reactions were minimal 
in july  we also presented the results of an interim efficacy analysis of a dose escalating  randomized  double blind  placebo controlled phase trial of subcutaneously delivered regn in hyperlipidemic patients familial hypercholesterolemia and non familial hypercholesterolemia on stable doses of statins whose ldl levels were greater than milligrams per deciliter mg dl 
at the highest dose tested at that time  in eleven patients  a single dose of regn achieved an approximately maximum mean additional reduction of ldl cholesterol from baseline 
no serious adverse events and no dose limiting toxicities were reported 
during  three phase studies with subcutaneous regimens of regn were initiated a randomized  double blind  multi dose  placebo controlled  patient trial in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia hefh  a randomized  double blind  multi dose  placebo controlled  patient trial in combination with atorvastatin in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia  and a randomized  double blind  multi dose  placebo controlled  patient trial in combination with atorvastatin in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and on stable doses of atorvastatin 
the primary endpoint of each phase study is the change in ldl cholesterol from baseline compared to placebo over the study period 
in november  we announced preliminary results from the phase hefh trial 
the objective of the study was to compare the effect of adding regn to the existing lipid lowering therapy in hefh patients 
in the primary efficacy analysis of the study  after weeks of treatment  patients who received different dosing regimens of regn achieved mean ldl cholesterol reductions from baseline ranging from approximately to greater than  depending on the dosing regimen of regn  compared to a mean reduction of with placebo p for all dose groups 
patients in the study are being followed for a total of weeks for safety 
in this trial  regn was generally well tolerated over weeks 
there were no elevations in liver function tests greater than three times the upper limit of normal uln and no cases of elevated creatine phosphokinase reported 
the most common adverse event was injection site reaction and there were no serious adverse events on active treatment 
full safety data from the week post treatment monitoring period will be presented at a future medical congress upon final analysis 
in november  we also announced preliminary results from the phase trial studying patients with primary hypercholesterolemia who were on stable doses of atorvastatin 
the primary objective of the study was to compare the effect of switching to a high dose of atorvastatin alone mg versus a high dose of atorvastatin combined with regn in the primary endpoint of the study  after eight weeks of treatment  patients who received regn plus atorvastatin mg achieved a greater than reduction in mean ldl cholesterol compared to a mean reduction of for atorvastatin mg alone p 
the study also included a third arm in which regn was added to the stable low dose of atorvastatin and the patients achieved a greater than reduction in mean ldl cholesterol 
patients in the study were followed for a total of weeks for safety 
in this trial  regn was generally well tolerated over weeks 
there was one serious adverse event of dehydration in the regn plus atorvastatin mg group that was deemed not treatment related 
one patient in the regn plus atorvastatin mg group with mildly elevated aspartate aminotransferase ast prior to randomization uln and uln experienced an elevation of ast uln and uln and one patient discontinued therapy due to a hypersensitivity reaction rash 
initial data from the third phase trial  studying subcutaneous regimens of regn in combination with atorvastatin in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia  are expected to be available in the first half of regn is being developed in collaboration with sanofi 
regn il r antibody for allergic and immune conditions il r is required for signaling by the cytokines il and il both of these cytokines are critical mediators of immune response  which  in turn  drives the formation of immunoglobulin e ige antibodies and the development of allergic responses  as well as the atopic state that underlies asthma and atopic dermatitis 
regn is a fully human monoclonal antibody generated using our velocimmune technology that is designed to bind to il r 
regn is in a phase b study in patients with atopic dermatitis and a phase study in eosinophilic asthma 
regn is being developed in collaboration with sanofi 
regn dll antibody for advanced malignancies in many clinical settings  positively or negatively regulating blood vessel growth could have important therapeutic benefits  as could the repair of damaged and leaky vessels 
vegf was the first growth factor shown to be specific for blood vessels  by virtue of having its receptor primarily expressed on blood vessel cells 
in the december  issue of the journal nature  we reported data from a preclinical study demonstrating that blocking an important cell signaling molecule  known as dll  inhibited the growth of experimental tumors by interfering with their ability to produce a functional blood supply 
the inhibition of tumor growth was seen in a variety of tumor types  including those that were resistant to blockade of vegf  suggesting a novel anti angiogenesis therapeutic approach 
moreover  inhibition of tumor growth is enhanced by the combination of dll and vegf blockade in many preclinical tumor models 
regn is a fully human monoclonal antibody to dll generated using our velocimmune technology  and is in phase clinical development 
regn is being developed in collaboration with sanofi 
regn ang antibody for oncology in the fourth quarter of  we initiated a phase study in an oncology setting of regn  an antibody that specifically blocks ang the angiopoietins  which were discovered at regeneron  are ligands for the endothelial cell receptor tie and are essential for vascular development and angiogenesis 
unlike other family members  ang is strongly upregulated by endothelial cells at sites of angiogenesis and vascular remodeling  including tumors 
regn is a fully human monoclonal antibody generated using our velocimmune technology  which is being developed for cancer indications 
regn is being developed in collaboration with sanofi 
regn ngf antibody for pain regn is a fully human monoclonal antibody to ngf  generated using our velocimmune technology  which is designed to block pain sensitization in neurons 
preclinical experiments indicate that regn specifically binds to and blocks ngf activity and does not bind to or block cell signaling for closely related neurotrophins such as nt  nt  or bdnf 
in may  we announced positive results from an interim analysis of a randomized  double blind  four arm  placebo controlled phase trial in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee 
in july  we presented additional results from this trial through weeks 
in december  we were informed by the fda that a case confirmed as avascular necrosis of a joint was seen in another company s anti ngf program 
the fda believes this case  which follows previously reported cases of joint replacements in patients on an anti ngf drug candidate being developed by another pharmaceutical company  provides evidence to suggest a class effect and has placed regn  along with the two other anti ngf antibodies in development by competitors  on clinical hold 
an fda arthritis advisory committee meeting is scheduled for march  to discuss possible safety issues related to anti ngf compounds 
there are currently no ongoing trials with regn in february  sanofi elected not to continue co development of regn  and regeneron now has sole global rights to regn under the terms of our agreement  sanofi remains obligated to fund agreed upon regn development costs through the end of and is entitled to receive a mid single digit royalty on any future sales of regn regn in the fourth quarter of  clinical trials began with regn  a fully human monoclonal antibody generated using our velocimmune technology  against an undisclosed target 
regn is being developed in collaboration with sanofi 
regn in december  the fda accepted our investigational new drug ind filing for regn and in january  we initiated a phase clinical study

regn is being developed in collaboration with sanofi 
regn regn is a fully human monoclonal antibody generated using our velocimmune technology  against an undisclosed target  and is being evaluated in a phase a study in patients with atopic dermatitis 
in july  sanofi elected not to continue co development of regn  and regeneron now has sole global rights to regn under the terms of our agreement  sanofi remains obligated to fund regn clinical costs through conclusion of a planned proof of concept trial and is entitled to receive a mid single digit royalty on any future sales of regn regn regn is a fully human monoclonal antibody generated using our velocimmune technology  against an undisclosed target 
in december  we submitted a phase clinical trial protocol in australia for regn under the clinical trial notification ctn regulatory process 
we plan to initiate human studies in the first quarter of in australia 
sanofi decided not to opt in to the regn program and we have sole global rights 
under the terms of our agreement  sanofi is entitled to receive a mid single digit royalty on any future sales of regn research and development technologies many proteins that are either on the surface of or secreted by cells play important roles in biology and disease 
one way that a cell communicates with other cells is by releasing specific signaling proteins  either locally or into the bloodstream 
these proteins have distinct functions and are classified into different families of molecules  such as peptide hormones  growth factors  and cytokines 
all of these secreted or signaling proteins travel to and are recognized by another set of proteins  called receptors  which reside on the surface of responding cells 
these secreted proteins impact many critical cellular and biological processes  causing diverse effects ranging from the regulation of growth of particular cell types to inflammation mediated by white blood cells 
secreted proteins can at times be overactive and thus result in a variety of diseases 
in these disease settings  blocking the action of specific secreted proteins can have clinical benefit 
in other cases  proteins on the cell surface can mediate the interaction between cells  such as the processes that give rise to inflammation and autoimmunity 
our scientists have developed two different technologies to design protein therapeutics to block the action of specific cell surface or secreted proteins 
the first technology  termed the trap technology  was used to generate our two approved products  arcalyst and eylea  as well as zaltrap  which is in phase clinical trials 
these novel traps are composed of fusions between two distinct receptor components and the constant region of an antibody molecule called the fc region  resulting in high affinity product candidates 
velocisuite tm is our second technology platform  it is used for discovering  developing  and producing fully human monoclonal antibodies that can address both secreted and cell surface targets 
velocisuite tm velocisuite tm consists of velocimmune  velocigene  velocimouse  and velocimab 
the velocimmune mouse platform is utilized to produce fully human monoclonal antibodies 
velocimmune was generated by exploiting our velocigene technology see below  in a process in which six megabases of mouse immune gene loci were replaced  or humanized  with corresponding human immune gene loci 
velocimmune mice can be used to generate efficiently fully human monoclonal antibodies to targets of therapeutic interest 
velocimmune and our entire velocisuite tm offer the potential to increase the speed and efficiency through which human monoclonal antibody therapeutics may be discovered and validated  thereby improving the overall efficiency of our early stage drug development activities 
we are utilizing the velocimmune technology to produce our next generation of drug candidates for preclinical and clinical development 
our velocigene platform allows custom and precise manipulation of very large sequences of dna to produce highly customized alterations of a specified target gene  or genes  and accelerates the production of knock out and transgenic expression models without using either positive negative selection or isogenic dna 
in producing knock out models  a color or fluorescent marker may be substituted in place of the actual gene sequence  allowing for high resolution visualization of precisely where the gene is active in the body during normal body functioning as well as in disease processes 
for the optimization of preclinical development and pharmacology programs  velocigene offers the opportunity to humanize targets by replacing the mouse gene with the human homolog 
thus  velocigene allows scientists to rapidly identify the physical and biological effects of deleting or over expressing the target gene  as well as to characterize and test potential therapeutic molecules 
our velocimouse technology platform allows for the direct and immediate generation of genetically altered mice from embryonic stem cells es cells  thereby avoiding the lengthy process involved in generating and breeding knockout mice from chimeras 
mice generated through this method are normal and healthy and exhibit a germ line transmission 
furthermore  mice developed using our velocimouse technology are suitable for direct phenotyping or other studies 
we have also developed our velocimab platform for the rapid screening of antibodies and rapid generation of expression cell lines for our traps and our velocimmune human monoclonal antibodies 
antibody collaboration and license agreements sanofi 
in november  we and sanofi entered into a global  strategic collaboration to discover  develop  and commercialize fully human monoclonal antibodies 
the collaboration is governed by a discovery and preclinical development agreement and a license and collaboration agreement 
in connection with the execution of the discovery agreement in  we received a non refundable  up front payment of million from sanofi 
pursuant to the collaboration  sanofi is funding our research to identify and validate potential drug discovery targets and develop fully human monoclonal antibodies against these targets 
we lead the design and conduct of research activities under the collaboration  including target identification and validation  antibody development  research and preclinical activities through filing of an investigational new drug application ind or its equivalent  toxicology studies  and manufacture of preclinical and clinical supplies 
for each drug candidate identified through discovery research under the discovery agreement  sanofi has the option to license rights to the candidate under the license agreement 
if it elects to do so  sanofi will co develop the drug candidate with us through product approval 
development costs for the drug candidate are shared between the companies  with sanofi generally funding these costs up front  except that following receipt of the first positive phase trial results for a co developed drug candidate  subsequent phase trial related costs for that drug candidate are shared by sanofi and by us 
we are generally responsible for reimbursing sanofi for half of the total development costs for all collaboration antibody products from our share of profits from commercialization of collaboration products to the extent they are sufficient for this purpose 
however  we are not required to apply more than of our share of the profits from collaboration products in any calendar quarter towards reimbursing sanofi for these development costs 
sanofi will lead commercialization activities for products developed under the license agreement  subject to our right to co promote such products 
the parties will equally share profits and losses from sales within the united states 
the parties will share profits outside the united states on a sliding scale based on sales starting at sanofi us and ending at sanofi us  and will share losses outside the united states at sanofi us 
in addition to profit sharing  we are entitled to receive up to million in sales milestone payments  with milestone payments commencing after aggregate annual sales outside the united states exceed billion on a rolling month basis 
in november  we and sanofi amended these agreements to expand and extend our antibody collaboration 
the goal of the expanded collaboration is to advance a total of to new antibody product candidates into clinical development from through under the amended discovery agreement  sanofi agreed to fund up to million per year of our antibody discovery activities over the period from  subject to a one time option for sanofi to adjust the maximum reimbursement amount down to million per year commencing in if over the prior two years certain specified criteria were not satisfied 
sanofi has an option to extend the discovery program for up to an additional three years after for further antibody development and preclinical activities 
pursuant to the collaboration  sanofi is also obligated to fund up to million of agreed upon costs we incur to expand our manufacturing capacity at our rensselaer  new york facilities 
in  as we scaled up our capacity to conduct antibody discovery activities  sanofi funded million of our preclinical research under the expanded collaboration 
the balance between that amount and million  or million  has been added to the funding otherwise available to us in under the amended discovery agreement 
from the collaboration s inception in november through december   sanofi has funded a total of million of our costs under the discovery agreement and a total of million of our development costs under the license agreement  or a total of million in funding for our antibody research and development activities during this period 
in august  we entered into an agreement with sanofi to use our velocigene platform to supply sanofi with genetically modified mammalian models of gene function and disease 
under this agreement  sanofi is required to pay us a minimum of million for the term of the agreement  which extends through december  for knock out and transgenic models of gene function for target genes identified by sanofi 
sanofi will use these models for its internal research programs that are outside of the scope of our antibody collaboration 
astellas pharma inc in march  we entered into a six year  non exclusive license agreement with astellas pharma inc to allow astellas to utilize our velocimmune technology in its internal research programs to discover human monoclonal antibodies 
under the terms of the agreement  astellas made a million annual  non refundable payment to us in each of the second quarters of    and in july  the license agreement with astellas was amended and extended through june under the terms of the amended agreement  astellas made a million up front payment to us in august in addition  astellas will make a million second payment to us in june unless the license agreement has been terminated prior to that date 
astellas has the right to terminate the agreement at any time by providing days advance written notice 
under certain limited circumstances  such as our material breach of the agreement  astellas may terminate the agreement and receive a refund of a portion of its up front payment or  if such termination occurs after june  a portion of its second payment  to us under the july amendment to the agreement 
we are entitled to receive a mid single digit royalty on any future sales of antibody products discovered by astellas using our velocimmune technology 
astrazeneca uk limited 
in february  we entered into a six year  non exclusive license agreement with astrazeneca uk limited to allow astrazeneca to utilize our velocimmune technology in its internal research programs to discover human monoclonal antibodies 
under the terms of the agreement  astrazeneca made a million annual  non refundable payment to us in each of the first quarters of    and in november  as permitted by the agreement  medimmune limited as successor by novation from astrazeneca gave written notice of voluntary termination of the agreement  effective in february  thereby canceling its obligation to make either of the final two annual payments 
we remain entitled to receive a mid single digit royalty on any future sales of antibody products discovered by medimmune using our velocimmune technology 
royalty agreement with novartis pharma ag under a june agreement with novartis that replaced a previous collaboration and license agreement  we receive royalties on worldwide sales of novartis canakinumab  a fully human anti interleukin il antibody 
the royalty rates in the agreement start at and reach when annual sales exceed billion 
canakinumab is marketed for the treatment of caps  has completed phase development for gout  and is in earlier stage development for atherosclerosis and other inflammatory diseases 
we are unable to predict whether canakinumab will be approved for gout or any other indication in addition to caps  or whether  even if approved  canakinumab for such indication s will be successfully commercialized 
accordingly  we are unable to predict whether these royalties will ever contribute materially to our results of operations or financial condition 
to date these royalties have been minimal 
national institutes of health grant in september  we were awarded a five year grant from the national institutes of health nih as part of the nih s knockout mouse project 
the goal of the knockout mouse project was to build a comprehensive and broadly available resource of knockout mice to accelerate the understanding of gene function and human diseases 
under the nih grant  as amended  amounts received or receivable by us from the grant s inception through december  totaled million 
no further funding will be received by us in connection with the nih grant 
research programs our preclinical research programs are in the areas of oncology and angiogenesis  ophthalmology  metabolic and related diseases  muscle diseases and disorders  inflammation and immune diseases  bone and cartilage  pain  cardiovascular diseases  and infectious diseases 
sales and marketing we have a new products marketing and planning group and a market research group to evaluate commercial opportunities for our targets and drug candidates  assess the competitive environment  and analyze the commercial potential of our product portfolio 
this group works in close collaboration with our collaborators for co developed products to develop marketing plans and forecasts and to develop and execute pre launch market development programs 
in connection with the sales and marketing of arcalyst for caps  we have a small marketing  trade  reimbursement  and distribution group to provide case management and reimbursement services to patients with caps and their treating physicians 
in preparation for the launch of eylea for wet amd in  we hired and trained a full service commercialization group to execute the launch of eylea 
the group includes experienced professionals in the fields of marketing  communications  professional education  patient education and advocacy  reimbursement and managed markets  trade and distribution  commercial operations  commercial analytics  market research  and forecasting 
moreover  we have hired  trained  and deployed a field based organization of approximately individuals  including regional sales directors  medical sales specialists  and reimbursement managers  each with years of experience in the biopharmaceutical industry in a variety of therapeutic areas including oncology  ophthalmology  immunology  and inflammation 
we outsource the warehousing and distribution of our finished drug products 
manufacturing our manufacturing facilities are located in rensselaer  new york and consist of three buildings totaling approximately  square feet of research  manufacturing  office  and warehouse space 
we currently have approximately  liters of cell culture capacity at these facilities 
at december   we employed people at our rensselaer facilities 
there were no impairment losses associated with long lived assets at these facilities as of december  among the conditions for regulatory marketing approval of a medicine is the requirement that the prospective manufacturer s quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to the good manufacturing practice gmp regulations of the health authority 
in complying with standards set forth in these regulations  manufacturers must continue to expend time  money  and effort in the areas of production and quality control to ensure full technical compliance 
manufacturing establishments  both foreign and domestic  are also subject to inspections by or under the authority of the fda and by other national  federal  state  and local agencies 
we are approved to manufacture our marketed products at our rensselaer facilities 
if our manufacturing facilities fail to maintain compliance with fda and other regulatory requirements  we may be required to suspend manufacturing 
this would likely have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  financial condition  and cash flows 
competition we face substantial competition from pharmaceutical  biotechnology  and chemical companies see item a 
risk factors risks related to commercialization of eylea for the treatment of wet amd and risks related to commercialization of products 
our competitors include genentech a member of the roche group  novartis  pfizer inc  bayer healthcare  onyx pharmaceuticals  inc  eli lilly and company  abbott laboratories  sanofi  merck co  inc  amgen inc  astrazeneca  bristol myers squibb  johnson johnson  glaxosmithkline  and others 
many of our competitors have substantially greater research  preclinical  and clinical product development and manufacturing capabilities  and financial  marketing  and human resources than we do 
competition from smaller competitors may also be or become more significant if those competitors acquire or discover patentable inventions  form collaborative arrangements  or merge with large pharmaceutical companies 
even if we are able to commercialize additional product candidates  one or more of our competitors may have brought a competitive product to market earlier than us or may have obtained or obtain patent protection that dominates or adversely affects our activities or products 
our ability to compete will depend  to a great extent  on how fast we can develop safe and effective product candidates  complete clinical testing and approval processes  and supply commercial quantities of the product to the market 
competition among product candidates approved for sale will also be based on efficacy  safety  reliability  availability  price  patent position  and other factors 
eylea 
the market for eye disease products is very competitive 
novartis and genentech are collaborating on the commercialization and further development of a vegf antibody fragment lucentis for the treatment of wet amd  dme  rvo  and other eye indications 
lucentis was approved by the fda in june for the treatment of wet amd and in june for the treatment of macular edema following retinal vein occlusion rvo 
lucentis was approved by the european medicines agency ema for wet amd in january  for the treatment of dme in january  and for the treatment of rvo in june many other companies  including genentech  are working on the development of product candidates and extended delivery devices for the potential treatment of wet amd  dme  and rvo including those that act by blocking vegf and vegf receptors  as well as use of small interfering ribonucleic acids sirnas that modulate gene expression 
for example  in january   genentech submitted an ind for an extended delivery device 
in addition  ophthalmologists are using off label  with success for the treatment of wet amd  dme  and rvo  a third party repackaged version of genentech s approved vegf antagonist  avastin bevacizumab 
the relatively low cost of therapy with avastin in patients with wet amd presents a significant competitive challenge in this indication 
the national eye institute nei and others are conducting long term  controlled clinical trials comparing lucentis to avastin in the treatment of wet amd 
one year data from the comparison of age related macular degeneration treatments trial catt were reported in april and indicated that avastin dosed monthly was non inferior to lucentis dosed monthly in the primary efficacy endpoint of mean visual acuity gain at weeks 
avastin is also being evaluated in eye diseases in trials that have been initiated in the united kingdom  canada  brazil  mexico  germany  israel  and other areas 
it may be difficult for eylea to compete in this or other eye indications for which it may be approved against lucentis and off label use of avastin because doctors and patients have had significant experience using these medicines and because of the relatively low cost of avastin 
moreover  the recently reported results of the catt study  combined with the relatively low cost of avastin in treating patients with wet amd  may well exacerbate the competitive challenge which eylea will face in this or other eye indications for which it may be approved 
in addition  while we believe that zaltrap would not be well tolerated if administered directly to the eye  if zaltrap is approved for the treatment of certain cancers  there is a risk that third parties will attempt to repackage zaltrap for off label use and sale for the treatment of wet amd and other diseases of the eye  which would present a potential low cost competitive threat to eylea for wet amd or other eye indications 
arcalyst 
in  novartis received regulatory approval in the united states and europe for canakinumab  a fully human anti interleukin il antibody  for the treatment of caps 
in january  novartis announced that it had submitted an application to the ema for approval of canakinumab in the treatment of gout flares 
novartis submitted a supplemental bla to the fda in the first quarter of for approval of canakinumab in gout  which was denied in august based upon safety concerns 
canakinumab is also in development for atherosclerosis and a number of other inflammatory diseases 
in addition  there are both small molecules and antibodies in development by other third parties that are designed to block the synthesis of il or inhibit the signaling of il for example  xoma ltd  in collaboration with servier  is developing an antibody to il  and both amgen and medimmune are developing antibodies to the il receptor 
these drug candidates could offer competitive advantages over arcalyst 
the successful development and or commercialization of these competing molecules could adversely affect sales of arcalyst for caps and delay or impair our ability to commercialize arcalyst for indications other than caps 
zaltrap 
many companies are developing therapeutic molecules designed to block the actions of vegf specifically and angiogenesis in general 
a variety of approaches have been employed  including antibodies to vegf  antibodies to the vegf receptor  small molecule antagonists to the vegf receptor tyrosine kinase  and other anti angiogenesis strategies 
many of these alternative approaches may offer competitive advantages to aflibercept in efficacy  side effect profile  durability of effect  or method of delivery 
additionally  some of these molecules are already approved for marketing and have a broader range of indications than our product candidate 
in particular  genentech has an approved vegf antagonist  avastin  on the market for treating certain cancers and a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are working to develop competing vegf antagonists  including novartis  amgen  imclone llc eli lilly  pfizer  astrazeneca  and glaxosmithkline 
many of these molecules are further along in development than zaltrap and may offer competitive advantages over our molecule 
pfizer  onyx together with its partner bayer healthcare  and glaxosmithkline are selling and marketing oral medications that target tumor cell growth and new vasculature formation that fuels the growth of tumors 
monoclonal antibodies 
our clinical candidates in development are all fully human monoclonal antibodies which were generated using our velocimmune technology 
our antibody generation technologies and clinical candidates face competition from many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies using various technologies 
numerous other companies are developing therapeutic antibody products 
companies such as pfizer  johnson johnson  astrazeneca  amgen  biogen idec  inc  novartis  genentech  bristol myers squib  abbott  and glaxosmithkline have generated therapeutic products that are currently in development or on the market that are derived from recombinant dna that comprise human antibody sequences 
as noted above  astellas has licensed our velocimmune technology as part of their internal antibody development programs 
we are aware of several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies actively engaged in the research and development of antibody products against targets that are also the targets of our early stage product candidates 
for example  pfizer  johnson johnson  and abbott are developing antibody product candidates against ngf 
genentech is marketing an antibody against il r tocilizumab for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis  and several other companies  including centocor ortho biotech  inc and bristol myers squibb  have antibodies against il in clinical development for this disease 
glaxosmithkline  in partnership with oncomed pharmaceuticals  inc  has a dll antibody in clinical development for the treatment of solid tumors 
aerovance has completed initial clinical trials of two formulations of a biologic directed against il amgen previously had an antibody against il r in clinical development for the treatment of asthma 
amgen and pfizer have development programs for antibodies against pcsk  alnylam has a clinical program underway with an rnai molecule against pcsk amgen  pfizer  and astrazeneca have development programs underway for antibodies against ang other areas 
many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are attempting to discover new therapeutics for indications in which we invest substantial time and resources 
in these and related areas  intellectual property rights have been sought and certain rights have been granted to competitors and potential competitors of ours  and we may be at a substantial competitive disadvantage in such areas as a result of  among other things  our lack of experience  trained personnel  and expertise 
a number of corporate and academic competitors are involved in the discovery and development of novel therapeutics that are the focus of other research or development programs we are now conducting 
these competitors include amgen and roche  as well as many others 
many firms and entities are engaged in research and development in the areas of cytokines  interleukins  angiogenesis  and muscle conditions 
some of these competitors are currently conducting advanced preclinical and clinical research programs in these areas 
these and other competitors may have established substantial intellectual property and other competitive advantages 
if any of these or other competitors announces a successful clinical study involving a product that may be competitive with one of our product candidates or the grant of marketing approval by a regulatory agency for a competitive product  such developments may have an adverse effect on our business  operating results  financial condition  cash flows  or future prospects 
we also compete with academic institutions  governmental agencies  and other public or private research organizations  which conduct research  seek patent protection  and establish collaborative arrangements for the development and marketing of products that would provide royalties or other consideration for use of their technology 
these institutions are becoming more active in seeking patent protection and licensing arrangements to collect royalties or other consideration for use of the technology they have developed 
products developed in this manner may compete directly with products we develop 
we also compete with others in acquiring technology from these institutions  agencies  and organizations 
patents  trademarks  and trade secrets our success depends  in part  on our ability to obtain patents  maintain trade secret protection  and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties see item a 
risk factors risks related to intellectual property and market exclusivity we may be restricted in our development  manufacturing  and or commercialization activities by  and could be subject to damage awards if we are found to have infringed  third party patents or other proprietary rights  and the costs and expenses of ongoing patent litigation have been and will likely continue to be significant 
our policy is to file patent applications to protect technology  inventions  and improvements that we consider important to our business and operations 
as of december   we held an ownership interest in a total of approximately issued patents in the united states and approximately issued patents in foreign countries with respect to our products and technologies 
in addition  we hold an ownership interest in hundreds of patent applications in the united states and foreign countries 
our patent portfolio includes granted patents and pending patent applications covering our velocisuite technologies  including our velocimmune mouse platform which produces fully human monoclonal antibodies 
our issued patents covering these technologies generally expire between and however  we continue to file patent applications directed to improvements to these technology platforms 
our patent portfolio also includes issued patents and pending applications relating to our marketed products  arcalyst and eylea  and our product candidates in clinical development 
these patents cover the proteins and dna encoding the proteins  manufacturing patents  method of use patents  and pharmaceutical compositions  as well as various methods of using the products 
for each of arcalyst  eylea and our late stage product candidate  zaltrap  these patents generally expire between and however  the projected patent terms may be subject to extension based on potential patent term extensions in countries where such extensions are available 
we also are the nonexclusive licensee of a number of additional patents and patent applications 
in december  we and genentech entered into a non exclusive license and partial settlement agreement relating to ophthalmic sales of eylea in the united states 
pursuant to this agreement  we received a non exclusive license to certain patents relating to vegf receptor proteins  known as the davis smyth patents  and other technology patents 
under the terms of the agreement  we agreed to make payments to genentech based on us sales of eylea commencing upon fda approval of eylea in november through may  we will be required to make a one time  non refundable million payment upon cumulative us sales of eylea reaching million 
in addition  we agreed to pay royalties of on cumulative us sales of eylea between million and billion and on any cumulative us sales of eylea over billion 
in july we entered into an amended and restated non exclusive license agreement with cellectis sa pursuant to which we licensed certain patents and patent applications relating to a process for the specific replacement of a copy of a gene in the receiver genome by homologous recombination 
pursuant to this agreement  we agreed to pay cellectis a low  single digit royalty based on any future revenue received by us from any future licenses or sales of our velocigene or velocimmune products or services 
no royalties are payable to cellectis on any revenue from commercial sales of antibodies from our velocimmune technology  including antibodies developed under our collaboration with sanofi 
we also have non exclusive license agreements with amgen and other organizations for patent rights related to arcalyst 
in connection with these licenses  we pay a combined mid single digit royalty on net sales of arcalyst 
patent law relating to the patentability and scope of claims in the biotechnology field is evolving and our patent rights are subject to this additional uncertainty 
the degree of patent protection that will be afforded to our products in the united states and other important commercial markets is uncertain and is dependent upon the scope of protection decided upon by the patent offices  courts  and governments in these countries 
there is no certainty that our existing patents or others  if obtained  will provide us protection from competition or provide commercial benefit 
others may independently develop similar products or processes to those developed by us  duplicate any of our products or processes or  if patents are issued to us  design around any products and processes covered by our patents 
we expect to continue  when appropriate  to file product and process applications with respect to our inventions 
however  we may not file any such applications or  if filed  the patents may not be issued 
patents issued to or licensed by us may be infringed by the products or processes of others 
defense and enforcement of our intellectual property rights is expensive and time consuming  even if the outcome is favorable to us 
it is possible that patents issued or licensed to us will be successfully challenged  that a court may find that we are infringing validly issued patents of third parties  or that we may have to alter or discontinue the development of our products or pay licensing fees to take into account patent rights of third parties see item a 
risk factors risks related to intellectual property and market exclusivity we may be restricted in our development  manufacturing  and or commercialization activities by  and could be subject to damage awards if we are found to have infringed  third party patents or other proprietary rights  and the costs and expenses of ongoing patent litigation have been and will likely continue to be significant 
government regulation regulation by government authorities in the united states and foreign countries is a significant factor in the research  development  manufacture  and marketing of arcalyst  eylea  and our product candidates see item a 
risk factors risks related to commercialization of eylea for wet amd our regulatory approval for sales of eylea is limited to the treatment of wet amd and is limited to sales in the united states 
if we don t receive approval for eylea for other indications  or if approvals are not obtained for sales in other countries  our sales and profits will be limited and risks related to the development and approval of our product candidates and new indications for our marketed products if we do not obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates or new indications for our marketed products  or maintain regulatory approval for eylea in the united states  we will not be able to market or sell them  which would materially and negatively impact our business  results of operations  and prospects 
all of our product candidates will require regulatory approval before they can be commercialized 
in particular  human therapeutic products are subject to rigorous preclinical and clinical trials and other pre market approval requirements by the fda and foreign authorities 
many aspects of the structure and substance of the fda and foreign pharmaceutical regulatory practices have been reformed during recent years  and continued reform is under consideration in a number of jurisdictions 
the ultimate outcome and impact of such reforms and potential reforms cannot be predicted 
the activities required before a product candidate may be marketed in the united states begin with preclinical tests 
preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations and animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate and its formulations 
the results of these studies must be submitted to the fda as part of an ind  which must be reviewed by the fda before proposed clinical testing can begin 
typically  clinical testing involves a three phase process 
in phase  trials are conducted with a small number of subjects to determine the early safety profile of the product candidate 
in phase  clinical trials are conducted with subjects afflicted with a specific disease or disorder to provide enough data to evaluate the preliminary safety  tolerability  and efficacy of different potential doses of the product candidate 
in phase  large scale clinical trials are conducted with patients afflicted with the specific disease or disorder in order to provide enough data to understand the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate  as required by the fda 
the results of the preclinical and clinical testing of a biologic product candidate are then submitted to the fda in the form of a bla for evaluation to determine whether the product candidate may be approved for commercial sale 
in responding to a bla  the fda may grant marketing approval  request additional information  or deny the application 
any approval required by the fda for any of our product candidates may not be obtained on a timely basis  or at all 
the designation of a clinical trial as being of a particular phase is not necessarily indicative that such a trial will be sufficient to satisfy the parameters of a particular phase  and a clinical trial may contain elements of more than one phase notwithstanding the designation of the trial as being of a particular phase 
the results of preclinical studies or early stage clinical trials may not predict long term safety or efficacy of our compounds when they are tested or used more broadly in humans 
approval of a product candidate by comparable regulatory authorities in foreign countries is generally required prior to commencement of marketing of the product in those countries 
the approval procedure varies among countries and may involve additional testing  and the time required to obtain such approval may differ from that required for fda approval 
various federal  state  and foreign statutes and regulations also govern or influence the research  manufacture  safety  labeling  storage  record keeping  marketing  transport  and other aspects of pharmaceutical product candidates 
the lengthy process of seeking these approvals and the compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us or our collaborators or licensees to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could adversely affect the manufacturing or marketing of our products and our ability to receive product or royalty revenue 
in addition to the foregoing  our present and future business will be subject to regulation under the united states atomic energy act  the clean air act  the clean water act  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  the national environmental policy act  the toxic substances control act  the resource conservation and recovery act  national restrictions  and other current and potential future local  state  federal  and foreign regulations 
business segments we manage our business as one segment which includes all activities related to the discovery of pharmaceutical products for the treatment of serious medical conditions and the development and commercialization of these discoveries 
this segment also includes revenues and expenses related to i research and development activities conducted under our collaboration agreements with third parties and our grant from the nih  ii product sales  including eylea for the treatment of wet amd and arcalyst for the treatment of caps  iii licensing agreements to utilize our velocimmune technology  and iv the supply of specified  ordered research materials using our velocigene technology platform 
employees as of december   we had  full time employees  of whom held a phd and or phd  or pharmd degree 
we believe that we have been successful in attracting skilled and experienced personnel in a highly competitive environment  however  competition for these personnel is intense 
none of our personnel are covered by collective bargaining agreements and our management considers its relations with our employees to be good

risk factors we operate in an environment that involves a number of significant risks and uncertainties 
we caution you to read the following risk factors  which have affected  and or in the future could affect  our business  prospects  operating results  and financial condition 
the risks described below include forward looking statements  and actual events and our actual results may differ materially from these forward looking statements 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business  prospects  operating results  and financial condition 
furthermore  additional risks and uncertainties are described under other captions in this report and should also be considered by our investors 
risks related to our financial results and need for additional financing we have had a history of operating losses and we may never achieve profitability 
if we continue to incur operating losses  we may be unable to continue our operations 
from inception on january  through december   we had a cumulative loss of billion 
if we continue to incur operating losses and fail to become a profitable company  we may be unable to continue our operations 
in the absence of substantial revenue from the sale of products  including our current sales of eylea  and arcalyst or from other sources  the amount  timing  nature or source of which cannot be predicted  our substantial losses will continue as we conduct our research and development activities  commercialize our approved products  and prepare for possible commercialization of our other product candidates and new indications of our marketed products 
we may need additional funding in the future  which may not be available to us  and which may force us to delay  reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts 
we will need to expend substantial resources for research and development  including costs associated with clinical testing of our product candidates and new indications of our marketed products  continued commercialization of eylea in the united states  to prepare for potential commercialization of our late stage product candidates and new indications for our marketed products and  if one or more of those product candidates or additional indications receive s regulatory approval  to fund the launch of those product s or new indications 
we believe our existing capital resources  together with funds generated by anticipated eylea net product sales and funding we are entitled to receive under our collaboration agreements  will enable us to meet our anticipated operating needs  however  one or more of our collaboration agreements may terminate  our revenues may fall short of our projections or be delayed  or our expenses may increase  which could result in our capital being consumed significantly faster than anticipated 
our expenses may increase for many reasons  including expenses in connection with the launch and marketing of eylea and the potential commercial launches of our late stage product candidates and new indications for our marketed products  manufacturing scale up  expenses related to clinical trials testing arcalyst  eylea  regn  regn  or regn  and expenses related to the potential requirement for us to fund of phase clinical trial costs for any of our antibody product candidates being developed in collaboration with sanofi 
we may require additional financing in the future and we may not be able to raise additional funds 
if we are able to obtain additional financing through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  such sales will likely be dilutive to our shareholders 
debt financing arrangements  if available given the current uncertainties in the global credit and financial markets  may require us to pledge certain assets or enter into covenants that would restrict our business activities or our ability to incur further indebtedness and may be at interest rates and contain other terms that are not favorable to our shareholders 
should we require and be unable to i raise sufficient funds to complete the development of our product candidates  ii to successfully commercialize our late stage product candidates or new indications for our marketed products if they obtain regulatory approval  and iii to continue our manufacturing and marketing of eylea for the treatment of wet amd  we may face delay  reduction  or elimination of our research and development or preclinical or clinical programs and our commercialization activities  which would significantly limit our potential to generate revenue 
we cannot be certain how profitable  if at all  our current marketing of eylea for the treatment of wet amd will be and  even if we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates or new indications for our marketed products  they may never be successfully launched or become profitable  in which case our business  prospects  operating results  and financial condition may be materially harmed 
the value of our investment portfolio is influenced by varying economic and market conditions and may experience losses 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities totaled million including million of restricted cash and marketable securities 
we have invested our excess cash primarily in direct obligations of the us government and its agencies  other debt securities guaranteed by the us government  and money market funds that invest in us government securities 
we consider assets classified as marketable securities to be available for sale  as defined by fasb authoritative guidance 
unrestricted and restricted marketable securities totaled million at december   are carried at fair value  and the unrealized gains and losses are included in other accumulated comprehensive income loss as a separate component of stockholders equity 
if the decline in the value of a security in our investment portfolio is deemed to be other than temporary  we write down the security to its current fair value and recognize a loss which may be fully charged against income 
the current economic environment and the volatility of securities markets increase the risk that we may not recover the principal we invested and or there may be further declines in the market value of securities in our investment portfolio 
as a result  we may incur additional charges against income in future periods for other than temporary impairments or realized losses upon a security s sale or maturity  and such amounts may be material 
risks related to the development and approval of our product candidates and new indications for our marketed products we believe that a significant portion of the value attributed to our company by investors is based on the commercial potential of eylea 
if approval for eylea is not obtained in countries outside the united states  or approval is not obtained for other indications  or if we fail to maintain regulatory compliance and lose the marketing approval we have in the united states  or if the product is withdrawn for any reason  our business  prospects  operating results  and financial condition will be materially harmed 
whether eylea is approved by regulatory authorities outside the united states or approved by the fda for new indications  and the timing thereof  will depend on many factors  including the following whether or not the fda determines that the evidence gathered in well controlled clinical trials  other clinical trials and nonclinical studies of eylea demonstrates that it is safe and effective as a treatment for the indication under review  and whether or not the fda is satisfied that the manufacturing facilities  processes  and controls for eylea are adequate  that the labeling is satisfactory  and that plans for post marketing studies  safety monitoring  and risk evaluation and management are sufficient  in june  bayer healthcare submitted regulatory applications for marketing approval of elyea in wet amd in the european union and japan 
analogous regulatory authorities in these and other countries outside the united states have similar discretion to the fda as to approval of eylea in those countries 
if bayer healthcare does not obtain approval to market eylea in the european union  japan  or other countries  or if there are material delays in obtaining such approvals  our business  prospects  operating results  and financial condition will be materially harmed 
if we do not obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates or new indications for our marketed products  or maintain regulatory approval for eylea in the united states  we will not be able to market or sell them  which would materially and negatively impact our business  results of operations  and prospects 
we cannot sell or market products without regulatory approval 
if we do not obtain and maintain regulatory approval for our product candidates  including arcalyst for the treatment of diseases other than caps  eylea for the treatment of ophthalmologic diseases other than wet amd  and or zaltrap for one or more oncology indications  the value of our company  our results of operations  and our prospects will be materially harmed 
our product candidates  including zaltrap for previously treated mcrc  eylea for crvo and dme  and arcalyst for the prevention of gout flares in patients initiating uric acid lowering therapy  may not receive regulatory approval 
if we are unable to obtain such approval s  or if we are materially delayed in doing so  our business  prospects  results of operations  and financial condition will be materially harmed 
in addition  if we fail to maintain regulatory approval for eylea for the treatment of wet amd  we may lose marketing approval and the ability to generate eylea product sales revenue  which would materially and negatively impact our business  prospects  results of operations  and financial condition 
obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval for drug products is costly  time consuming  and highly uncertain 
in the united states  we must obtain and maintain approval from the fda for each drug we intend to sell 
obtaining fda approval is typically a lengthy and expensive process  and approval is highly uncertain 
foreign governments also regulate drugs distributed in their country and approval in any country is likely to be a lengthy and expensive process  and approval is highly uncertain 
the fda enforces good clinical practices gcps and other regulations through periodic inspections of trial sponsors  clinical research organizations cros  principal investigators  and trial sites 
if we or any of the third parties conducting our clinical studies are determined to have failed to fully comply with gcps  the study protocol or applicable regulations  the clinical data generated in those studies may be deemed unreliable 
this could result in non approval of our product candidates by the fda  or we or the fda may decide to conduct additional audits or require additional clinical studies  which would delay our development programs  require us to incur additional costs  and could substantially harm our business 
before approving a new drug or biologic product  the fda requires that the facilities at which the product will be manufactured or advanced through the supply chain be in compliance with current good manufacturing practices  or cgmp  requirements and regulations governing the shipment and storage of the product 
manufacturing product candidates in compliance with these regulatory requirements is complex  time consuming  and expensive 
to be successful  our products must be manufactured for development  and following approval in commercial quantities  in compliance with regulatory requirements  and at competitive costs 
if we or any of our product collaborators  or third party manufacturers  product packagers  labelers  or other parties performing steps in the supply chain are unable to maintain regulatory compliance  the fda can impose regulatory sanctions  including  among other things  refusal to approve a pending application for a new drug or biologic product  or revocation of a pre existing approval 
as a result  our business  prospects  operating results  and financial condition may be materially harmed 
in addition to the fda and other regulatory agency regulations in the united states  we are subject to a variety of foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical trials  manufacturing  marketing and approval of drugs  and commercial sale and distribution of drugs in foreign countries 
the foreign regulatory approval process and requirements include all of the risks associated with fda approval as well as country specific regulations  and actions by a regulatory agency in a country or region with respect to a product candidate may have an impact on the approval process for that product candidate in another country or region 
whether or not we obtain fda approval for a product in the united states  we must obtain approval of the product by the comparable regulatory authorities in foreign countries before we can conduct clinical trials of or market that product or any other product in those countries 
clinical trials required for our product candidates and new indications of our marketed products are expensive and time consuming  and their outcome is highly uncertain 
if any of our drug trials are delayed or yield unfavorable results  regulatory approval for our product candidates or new indications of our marketed products may be delayed or become unobtainable 
as described above  we must conduct extensive testing of our product candidates and new indications of our marketed products before we can obtain regulatory approval to market and sell them 
we need to conduct both preclinical animal testing and human clinical trials 
conducting these trials is a lengthy  time consuming  and expensive process 
these tests and trials may not achieve favorable results for many reasons  including  among others  failure of the product candidate to demonstrate safety or efficacy  the development of serious or life threatening adverse events or side effects caused by or connected with exposure to the product candidate  difficulty in enrolling and maintaining subjects in the clinical trial  lack of sufficient supplies of the product candidate or comparator drug  and the failure of clinical investigators  trial monitors  contractors  consultants  or trial subjects to comply with the trial plan  protocol  or applicable regulations related to gcps 
a clinical trial may fail because it did not include and retain a sufficient number of patients to detect the endpoint being measured or reach statistical significance 
a clinical trial may also fail because the dose s of the investigational drug included in the trial were either too low or too high to determine the optimal effect of the investigational drug in the disease setting 
we will need to reevaluate any drug candidate that does not test favorably and either conduct new trials  which are expensive and time consuming  or abandon that drug development program 
the failure of clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of our clinical candidates for the desired indication s would preclude the successful development of those candidates for such indication s  in which event our business  prospects  operating results  and financial condition may be materially harmed 
successful development of our current and future product candidates is uncertain 
only a small minority of all research and development programs ultimately result in commercially successful drugs 
we are testing zaltrap and eylea in a number of late stage clinical trials in various indications and arcalyst for the prevention of gout flares in patients initiating uric acid lowering drug therapy 
clinical trials may not demonstrate statistically sufficient effectiveness and safety to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals for these product candidates in these indications 
in a number of instances  we have terminated the development of product candidates due to a lack of or only modest effectiveness 
moreover  even if we obtain positive results from preclinical testing or clinical trials  we may not achieve the same success in future trials 
many companies in the biopharmaceutical industry  including our company  have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials  even after promising results have been obtained in earlier trials 
in april we announced that our phase velour trial of zaltrap met its primary endpoint of improving overall survival in the treatment of patients with previously treated mcrc 
based upon these positive results  we and sanofi submitted regulatory applications for marketing approval to the fda and ema 
in january  roche announced that a phase trial of avastin bevacizumab had met the primary endpoint of overall survival in mcrc in patients who had previously received avastin with standard chemotherapy 
the positive results of this trial in a similar patient population could impact the potential commercial opportunity for zaltrap in mcrc 
zaltrap is also in a phase clinical trial in combination with a standard chemotherapy regimen for the treatment of first line androgen independent prostate cancer 
we do not have proof of concept data from early stage  double blind  controlled clinical trials that zaltrap will be safe or effective in this cancer setting 
in march  genentech announced that a phase trial of avastin  in combination with chemotherapy in men with prostate cancer  did not meet its primary endpoint 
this trial had a very similar design to our ongoing phase trial of zaltrap in prostate cancer 
we also reported positive phase trial results with eylea in crvo after six months of treatment and  based on these results  have submitted a supplemental bla filing to the fda for marketing approval in the united states of eylea in crvo 
under pdufa  we were granted a target date for an fda decision on our eylea in crvo supplemental bla of september  however  this expected timing for an fda decision may not be met  and the fda may not grant such approval or such approval may be substantially delayed 
the fda could also require us to provide additional clinical data in connection with this application 
there can be no assurance that we will receive regulatory approval for eylea in crvo 
we also reported positive results of a phase trial of eylea for the treatment of dme and that we have initiated a phase program in that indication 
a number of other potential new drugs and biologics which showed promising results in phase and clinical trials subsequently failed to establish sufficient safety and efficacy data to obtain necessary regulatory approvals  and this could occur with respect to subsequent clinical trials of eylea for the treatment of dme 
based on the results of three phase studies  we have submitted a supplemental bla filing to the fda seeking approval of arcalyst for the prevention of gout flares in patients initiating uric acid lowering drug therapy and  under pdufa  we were granted a target date for an fda decision on our arcalyst supplemental bla of july  however  this expected timing for an fda decision may not be met  and the fda may not grant such approval or such approval may be substantially delayed 
the fda could also require us to provide additional clinical data in connection with this application 
for example  in june  following two positive phase trials  the arthritis advisory committee of the fda  voted to recommend against approval in a gout indication for ilaris canikinumab  novartis il inhibitor which works through a similar mechanism as arcalyst and  in august  novartis received a complete response letter from the fda requesting additional information  including clinical data to evaluate the benefit risk profile of ilaris in refractory patients 
many of our clinical trials are conducted under the oversight of idmcs 
these independent oversight bodies are made up of external experts who review the progress of ongoing clinical trials  including available safety and efficacy data  and make recommendations concerning a trial s continuation  modification  or termination based on interim  unblinded data 
any of our ongoing clinical trials may be discontinued or amended in response to recommendations made by responsible idmcs based on their review of such interim trial results 
for example  in september  a phase trial that was evaluating zaltrap as a first line treatment for metastic pancreatic cancer in combination with gemcitabine was discontinued at the recommendation of an idmc after a planned analysis of interim efficacy data determined that the trial would not meet its efficacy endpoint 
the recommended termination of any of our ongoing late stage clinical trials by an idmc could negatively impact the future development of our product candidate s  and our business may be materially harmed 
we are studying our antibody candidates in a wide variety of indications in clinical trials 
many of these trials are exploratory studies designed to evaluate the safety profile of these compounds and to identify what diseases and uses  if any  are best suited for these product candidates 
these product candidates may not demonstrate the requisite efficacy and or safety profile to support continued development for some or all of the indications that are being  or are planned to be  studied  which would diminish our clinical pipeline and could negatively affect our future prospects and the value of our company 
serious complications or side effects in connection with the use of our products and in clinical trials for our product candidates and new indications for our marketed products could cause our regulatory approvals to be revoked or limited or lead to delay or discontinuation of development of our product candidates or new indications for our marketed products  which could severely harm our business 
during the conduct of clinical trials  patients report changes in their health  including illnesses  injuries  and discomforts  to their study doctor 
often  it is not possible to determine whether or not the drug candidate being studied caused these conditions 
various illnesses  injuries  and discomforts have been reported from time to time during clinical trials of our product candidates and new indications for our marketed products 
it is possible that as we test our drug candidates or new indications in larger  longer  and more extensive clinical programs  or as use of these drugs becomes more widespread if they receive regulatory approval  illnesses  injuries  and discomforts that were observed in earlier trials  as well as conditions that did not occur or went undetected in previous trials  will be reported by patients 
many times  side effects are only detectable after investigational drugs are tested in large scale  phase clinical trials or  in some cases  after they are made available to patients after approval 
if additional clinical experience indicates that any of our product candidates or new indications for our marketed products has many side effects or causes serious or life threatening side effects  the development of the product candidate may fail or be delayed  or if the product candidate has received regulatory approval such approval may be revoked  which would severely harm our business 
zaltrap is being studied for the potential treatment of certain types of cancer and eylea is being studied in diseases of the eye in addition to wet amd 
there are many potential safety concerns associated with significant blockade of vegf that may limit our ability to successfully develop zaltrap and eylea in each of the indications for which we are studying these product candidates 
these serious and potentially life threatening risks  based on clinical and preclinical experience of vegf inhibitors  include bleeding  intestinal perforation  hypertension  proteinuria  congestive heart failure  heart attack  and stroke 
in addition  patients given infusions of any protein  including zaltrap delivered through intravenous administration  may develop severe hypersensitivity reactions or infusion reactions 
other vegf blockers have reported side effects that became evident only after large scale trials or after marketing approval when large numbers of patients were treated 
there are risks inherent in the intravitreal administration of drugs like eylea  which can cause injury to the eye and other complications 
for example  in our phase trials of eylea in wet amd  the most frequent ocular adverse events were conjunctival hemorrhage  macular degeneration  eye pain  retinal hemorrhage  and vitreous floaters 
these and other complications or side effects could harm the development and or commercialization of zaltrap for the treatment of cancer or eylea for the treatment of diseases of the eye 
as more patients begin to use arcalyst if it receives regulatory approval for the prevention of gout flares in patients initiating uric acid lowering therapy  and to the extent it is tested in new disease settings  new risks and side effects associated with arcalyst may be discovered  and risks previously viewed as inconsequential could be determined to be significant 
like cytokine antagonists such as ilaris canakinumab  a registered trademark of novartis  kineret anakinra and enbrel etanercept  registered trademarks of amgen  and remicade infliximab a registered trademark of centocor ortho biotech  arcalyst affects the immune defense system of the body by blocking some of its functions 
therefore  arcalyst may interfere with the body s ability to fight infections 
as noted above  in june  following two positive phase trials  the arthritis advisory committee of the fda voted to recommend against approval in a gout indication for ilaris  novartis il inhibitor which works through a similar mechanism as arcalyst and  in august  novartis received a complete response letter from the fda requesting additional information  including clinical data to evaluate the benefit risk profile of ilaris in refractory patients 
treatment with kineret  a medication that works through the inhibition of il  has been associated with an increased risk of serious infections  and serious  life threatening infections have been reported in patients taking arcalyst 
these or other complications or side effects could cause regulatory authorities to revoke approvals of arcalyst for the treatment of caps or deny the approval of arcalyst for the prevention of gout flares in patients initiating uric acid lowering treatment or other disease settings 
alternatively  we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials  make changes in the labeling of our product  or limit or abandon our efforts to develop arcalyst in new disease settings 
any such side effects may also result in a reduction  or even the elimination  of sales of arcalyst in the current or future approved indications 
we are studying regn  a fully human monoclonal antibody to ngf  in a variety of pain indications  including osteoarthritis of the knee 
in december  we were informed by the fda that a case confirmed as avascular necrosis of a joint was seen in another company s anti ngf program 
the fda believes this case  which follows previously reported cases of joint replacements in patients on an anti ngf drug candidate being developed by another pharmaceutical company  provides evidence to suggest a class effect and placed regn on clinical hold 
the fda arthritis advisory committee is scheduled for march  to discuss possible safety issues related to anti ngf compounds 
there are currently no ongoing trials with regn that are either enrolling or treating patients 
our product candidates in development are recombinant proteins that could cause an immune response  resulting in the creation of harmful or neutralizing antibodies against the therapeutic protein 
in addition to the safety  efficacy  manufacturing  and regulatory hurdles faced by our product candidates  the administration of recombinant proteins frequently causes an immune response  resulting in the creation of antibodies against the therapeutic protein 
the antibodies can have no effect or can totally neutralize the effectiveness of the protein  or require that higher doses be used to obtain a therapeutic effect 
in some cases  the antibody can cross react with the patient s own proteins  resulting in an auto immune type disease 
whether antibodies will be created can often not be predicted from preclinical or clinical experiments  and their detection or appearance is often delayed  so neutralizing antibodies may be detected at a later date  in some cases even after pivotal clinical trials have been completed 
we may be unable to formulate or manufacture our product candidates in a way that is suitable for clinical or commercial use  which would delay or prevent continued development of such candidates and or receipt of regulatory approval or commercial sale  which could materially harm our business 
if we are unable to continue to develop suitable product formulations or manufacturing processes to support large scale clinical testing of our product candidates  including our antibody candidates  we may be unable to supply necessary materials for our clinical trials  which would delay or prevent the development of our product candidates 
similarly  if we are unable  directly or through our collaborators or third parties  to supply sufficient quantities of our products or develop formulations of our product candidates suitable for commercial use  we will be unable to obtain regulatory approval for those product candidates 
risks related to commercialization of eylea for the treatment of wet amd we are subject to significant ongoing regulatory obligations and oversight with respect to eylea for the treatment of wet amd 
if we fail to maintain regulatory compliance for eylea  we may lose marketing approval  which would materially harm our business  prospects  operating results  and financial condition 
eylea is currently approved for treatment of wet amd in the united states and bayer healthcare is seeking approval in other countries 
we are subject to significant ongoing regulatory obligations with respect to eylea for the treatment of wet amd in the united states  and  if approved outside the united states  commercialization of eylea will be subject to significant ongoing regulatory obligations and oversight in those countries where approval is obtained as well 
if we fail to maintain regulatory compliance for eylea for the treatment of wet amd  we may lose marketing approval  which would materially harm our business  prospects  operating results  and financial condition 
failure to comply may also subject us to sanctions  product recalls  or withdrawals of previously approved marketing applications 
see also if we fail to meet the stringent requirements of governmental regulation in the manufacture of drug products or product candidates  we could incur substantial remedial costs  delays in the development or approval of our product candidates and or in their commercial launch if they obtain regulatory approval  and a reduction in sales 
serious complications or side effects in connection with the use of eylea could materially harm our business  prospects  operating results  and financial condition 
there are risks inherent in intravitreal injections  including with eylea  such as intraocular inflammation  sterile and culture positive endophthalmitis  corneal decomposition  retinal detachment  retinal tear  and other side effects  all of which are reported from time to time to the fda 
serious complications or serious  unexpected side effects in connection with the use of eylea could materially harm our business  prospects  operating results  and financial condition 
our regulatory approval for sales of eylea is limited to the treatment of wet amd and is limited to sales in the united states 
if we don t receive approval for eylea for other indications  or if approvals are not obtained for sales in other countries  sales and profits will be limited 
we have received regulatory approval for sale of eylea for the treatment of wet amd only in the united states 
if we do not receive approval for eylea for other uses  or if approvals for sales in other countries are not obtained  sales will be limited and our potential for profits will be limited 
as a result  our business  prospects  results of operations  and financial condition would be materially impacted 
our sales of eylea for the treatment of wet amd are dependent on the availability and extent of reimbursement from third party payers  and changes to such reimbursement may materially harm our sales and potential revenue and harm our business  prospects  operating results  and financial condition 
our current sales in the united states of eylea for the treatment of wet amd are dependent  in part  on the availability and extent of reimbursement from third party payers  including government programs such as medicare and medicaid and private payer healthcare and insurance programs 
if approved for sale in other countries  such sales will be dependent  in part  on similar programs in these countries 
in the united states  there is an increased focus from the federal government and others on analyzing the impact of various regulatory programs on the federal deficit  which could result in increased pressure on federal programs to reduce costs  including limiting federal healthcare expenditures 
economic pressure on state budgets may also have a similar impact 
a reduction in the availability or extent of reimbursement from us government programs could have a material adverse effect on the sales of eylea 
since eylea for the treatment of wet amd is too expensive for most patients to afford without health insurance coverage  if adequate coverage and reimbursement by third party payers  including medicare and medicaid in the united states  is not available  our ability to successfully commercialize eylea will be materially adversely impacted 
our sales and potential profits and our business  prospects  operating results  and financial condition would be materially harmed 
see also the successful commercialization of eylea for the treatment of wet amd as well as our late stage product candidates or new indications for our marketed products  if approved  will depend on obtaining coverage and reimbursement for use of these products from third party payers  including medicare and medicaid in the united states  and these payers may not agree to cover or adequately reimburse for use of our products or may do so at levels that make our products uncompetitive and or unprofitable  which would materially harm our business  prospects  operating results  and financial condition 
the status of a j code for eylea could also affect reimbursement 
j codes are permanent reimbursement codes maintained by centers for medicare and medicaid services cms that are a component of the healthcare common procedure coding system hcpcs  and are typically used to report injectable drugs that ordinarily cannot be self administered 
we do not currently have a j code for eylea  although we anticipate assignment of a j code for eylea in january without a unique j code identifier  eylea must be billed using a non specific miscellaneous j code 
since such codes may be used for a wide variety of products  health plans may have more difficulty determining the actual product used and billed for the patient 
as a result  these claims must often be submitted with additional information and manually processed  which can create delays in claims processing times as well as increasing the likelihood for claim errors 
the commercial success of eylea currently being marketed for the treatment of wet amd is subject to strong competition 
the market for eye disease products is very competitive 
novartis and genentech are collaborating on the commercialization and further development of a vegf antibody fragment  lucentis for the treatment of wet amd  crvo  dme  and other eye indications 
lucentis was approved by the fda in june for the treatment of wet amd and in june for the treatment of macular edema following retinal vein occlusion rvo  crvo  and branch retinal vein occlusion brvo 
lucentis was also approved by the ema for wet amd in january and for dme in january many other companies are working on the development of product candidates for the potential treatment of wet amd and dme including those that act by blocking vegf and vegf receptors  as well as small interfering ribonucleic acids sirnas that modulate gene expression 
in addition  ophthalmologists are using off label  with success for the treatment of wet amd  dme  and rvo  third party repackaged versions of genentech s approved vegf antagonist  avastin 
the relatively low cost of therapy with avastin in patients with wet amd presents a significant competitive challenge in this indication 
the national eye institute nei and others are conducting long term  controlled clinical trials comparing lucentis to avastin in the treatment of wet amd 
one year data from the catt were reported in april and indicated that avastin dosed monthly was non inferior to lucentis dosed monthly in the primary efficacy endpoint of mean visual acuity gain at weeks 
avastin is also being evaluated in eye diseases in trials that have been initiated in the united kingdom  canada  brazil  mexico  germany  israel  and other countries 
it may be difficult for eylea in this or other eye indications for which it may be approved to compete against lucentis and off label use of avastin because doctors and patients have had significant experience using these medicines 
moreover  the recently reported results of the catt study  combined with the relatively low cost of avastin in treating patients with wet amd  may well exacerbate the competitive challenge which eylea will face in this or other eye indications for which it may be approved 
in addition  while we believe that zaltrap would not be well tolerated if administered directly to the eye  if zaltrap is approved for the treatment of certain cancers  there is a risk that third parties will attempt to repackage zaltrap for off label use and sale for the treatment of wet amd and other diseases of the eye  which would present a potential low cost competitive threat to eylea for wet amd or other eye indications 
see also the commercial success of eylea currently being marketed for the treatment of wet amd  and for our other product candidates or new indications for our marketed products  if any are approved for marketing  is highly uncertain given their method of administration  and because our competitors have received approval for and may be marketing products with a similar mechanism of action or may enter the marketplace with better or lower cost drugs 
risks related to intellectual property and market exclusivity if we cannot protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets or our patents are insufficient to protect our proprietary rights  our business and competitive position will be harmed 
our business requires using sensitive and proprietary technology and other information that we protect as trade secrets 
we seek to prevent improper disclosure of these trade secrets through confidentiality agreements 
if our trade secrets are improperly disclosed  by our own employees  our collaborators or otherwise  it would help our competitors and adversely affect our business 
we will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
the patent position of biotechnology companies  including our company  involves complex legal and factual questions and  therefore  enforceability cannot be predicted with certainty 
our patents may be challenged  invalidated  or circumvented 
patent applications filed outside the united states may be challenged by third parties who file an opposition 
such opposition proceedings are increasingly common in the european union and are costly to defend 
we have pending patent applications in the european patent office and it is likely that we will need to defend patent applications from third party challengers from time to time in the future 
patent applications filed in the united states may also be challenged by third parties who file a request for post grant review under the america invents act of  beginning on september  we expect that post grant review proceedings will become common in the united states and will be costly to defend 
we have pending patent applications in the united states patent and trademark office and it is likely that we will need to defend patent applications from third party challengers from time to time in the future 
our patent rights may not provide us with a proprietary position or competitive advantages against competitors 
furthermore  even if the outcome is favorable to us  the enforcement of our intellectual property rights can be extremely expensive and time consuming 
we may be restricted in our development  manufacturing  and or commercialization activities by  and could be subject to damage awards if we are found to have infringed  third party patents or other proprietary rights  and the costs and expenses of ongoing patent litigation have been and will likely continue to be significant 
our commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and other proprietary rights of third parties 
other parties may allege that they have blocking patents to our products in clinical development or even to products that have received regulatory approval and are being or have been commercialized  either because they claim to hold proprietary rights to the composition of a product or the way it is manufactured or used 
moreover  other parties may allege that they have blocking patents to antibody products made using our velocimmune technology  either because of the way the antibodies are discovered or produced or because of a proprietary composition covering an antibody or the antibody s target 
we are aware of issued patents and pending patent applications owned by genentech that claim certain chimeric vegf receptors 
we do not believe that zaltrap or eylea infringe any valid claim in these patents or patent applications 
we are involved in five patent litigations with genentech  two in the united states and three in europe 
in november  we commenced a lawsuit against genentech in the us district court for the southern district of new york the court  seeking a declaratory judgment that no activities relating to our vegf trap infringe any valid claim of certain genentech patents referred to as the davis smyth patents the first davis smyth case 
genentech answered the complaint and asserted counterclaims that our prior or planned activities relating to vegf trap have infringed or will infringe claims of four of the five davis smyth patents and requested a judgment against us for damages  including for willful infringement  and other relief as the court deems appropriate 
on december   we entered into a non exclusive license and partial settlement agreement the agreement with genentech that covers making  using  and selling eylea in the united states for the prevention and treatment of human eye diseases and disorders in the united states 
under the agreement  we received a non exclusive license to the davis smyth patents  and certain other technology patents owned or co owned by genentech 
the agreement does not cover any non us patent rights or non us patent disputes  and does not cover any use of aflibercept other than for prevention and treatment of human eye diseases and disorders in the united states 
the first davis smyth case is continuing with respect to matters not covered by the agreement 
the agreement provides for us to make payments to genentech based on us sales of eylea through may   the date the davis smyth patents expire 
we will make a lump sum payment of million once cumulative us sales of eylea reach million 
we will also pay royalties of on cumulative us sales of eylea between million and billion and on any cumulative us sales of eylea over billion 
as a result of the agreement  on january  genentech filed a second amended answer and counterclaim in the first davis smyth case  in which it amended its counterclaims alleging infringement of four of the five davis smyth patents 
on december   genentech initiated a related case in the court against regeneron and sanofi alleging infringement of four of the five davis smyth patents by activities relating to vegf trap but excluding eylea the second davis smyth case 
as in the first davis smyth case  in the new complaint genentech requests a judgment against us for damages  including for willful infringement  and other relief as the court deems appropriate 
we believe genentech s claims in the first davis smyth case and the second davis smyth case are without merit and intend to continue to defend against all of genentech s remaining claims vigorously 
however  it is possible that there could be an adverse determination or judgment in either or both cases that would materially harm our business by requiring us to seek a license for matters not covered by the agreement  which may not be available at all or on reasonable terms  or precluding the manufacture  further development  or sale of eylea outside the united states or zaltrap  or resulting in a damage award 
in addition  irrespective of the outcome of the davis smyth cases  we have incurred and will likely continue to incur significant costs and expenses associated with them  which have negatively affected  and will likely continue to negatively affect  our results of operations 
an adverse determination in any of the proceedings described herein may have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  results of operations  and financial condition 
we have initiated patent related actions against genentech in germany  the united kingdom  and italy  and may initiate other actions in other countries outside the united states  which could have similar or other adverse outcomes that would materially harm our business and which  irrespective of the outcomes  may also entail significant costs and expenses 
we are aware of patents and pending applications owned by roche that claim antibodies to il r and methods of treating rheumatoid arthritis with such antibodies 
we are developing sarilumab  an antibody to il r  for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis 
although we do not believe that sarilumab infringes any valid claim in these patents or patent applications  roche could initiate a lawsuit for patent infringement and assert its patents are valid and cover sarilumab 
we are aware of a us patent jointly owned by genentech and city of hope relating to the production of recombinant antibodies in host cells 
we currently produce our antibody product candidates using recombinant antibodies from host cells and may choose to produce additional antibody product candidates in this manner 
neither arcalyst  zaltrap  nor eylea are recombinant antibodies 
if any of our antibody product candidates are produced in a manner subject to valid claims in the genentech patent  then we may need to obtain a license from genentech  should one be available 
genentech has licensed this patent to several different companies under confidential license agreements 
if we desire a license for any of our antibody product candidates and are unable to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms or at all  we may be restricted in our ability to use genentech s techniques to make recombinant antibodies in or to import them into the united states 
further  we are aware of a number of other third party patent applications that  if granted with claims as currently drafted  may cover our current or planned activities 
it could be determined that our products and or actions in manufacturing or selling our product candidates infringe such patents 
patent holders in addition to genentech could assert claims against us for damages and seek to prevent us from manufacturing  selling  or developing our drug candidates  and a court may find that we are infringing validly issued patents of third parties 
in the event that the manufacture  use  or sale of any of our drug candidates  including eylea or our other late stage product candidates  infringes on the patents or violates other proprietary rights of third parties  we may be prevented from pursuing product development  manufacturing  and commercialization of those drugs and may be required to pay costly damages 
such a result may materially harm our business  prospects  operating results  and financial condition 
in any event  legal disputes are likely to be costly and time consuming to defend 
we seek to obtain licenses to patents when  in our judgment  such licenses are needed or advisable 
if any licenses are required  we may not be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
the failure to obtain any such license could prevent us from developing or commercializing any one or more of our product candidates  which could severely harm our business 
loss or limitation of patent rights  and new regulatory pathways for biosimilar competition  could reduce the duration of market exclusivity for our products 
in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries  the majority of an innovative product s commercial value is usually realized during the period in which it has market exclusivity 
in the united states and some other countries  when market exclusivity expires and generic versions of a product are approved and marketed  there usually are very substantial and rapid declines in the product s sales 
if our late stage product candidates or other clinical candidates are approved for marketing in the u 
s or elsewhere  market exclusivity for those products will generally be based upon patent rights and or certain regulatory forms of exclusivity 
as described above under if we cannot protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets or our patents are insufficient to protect our proprietary rights  our business and competitive position will be harmed  the scope and enforceability of our patent rights may vary from country to country 
the failure to obtain patent and other intellectual property rights  or limitations on the use  or the loss  of such rights could be material to us 
absent patent protection or regulatory exclusivity for our products  it is possible  both in the united states and elsewhere  that generic and or biosimilar versions of those products may be approved and marketed which would likely result in substantial and rapid reductions in revenues from sales of those products 
under the federal patient protection and affordable care act  or ppaca  enacted in  there is now a new  abbreviated path in the united states for regulatory approval of biosimilar versions of biological products 
the ppaca provides a regulatory mechanism that allows for fda approval of biologic drugs that are similar to but not generic copies of innovative drugs on the basis of less extensive data than is required by a full bla 
under this new regulation  an application for approval of a biosimilar may be filed four years after approval of the innovator product 
however  qualified innovative biological products will receive years of regulatory exclusivity  meaning that the fda may not approve a biosimilar version until years after the innovative biological product was first approved by the fda 
however  the term of regulatory exclusivity may not remain at years in the united states and could be shortened 
the increased likelihood of biosimilar competition has increased the risk of loss of innovators market exclusivity 
due to this risk  and uncertainties regarding patent protection  if our late stage product candidates or other clinical candidates are approved for marketing  it is not possible to predict the length of market exclusivity for a particular product with certainty based solely on the expiration of the relevant patent s or the current forms of regulatory exclusivity 
it is also not possible to predict changes in united states regulatory law that might reduce biological product regulatory exclusivity 
the loss of market exclusivity for a product would likely materially and negatively affect revenues from product sales of that product and thus our financial results and condition 
risks related to manufacturing and supply we rely on limited internal and contracted manufacturing and supply chain capacity  which could result in our being unable to continue to successfully commercialize eylea and to commercialize our other product candidates or other indications for our marketed products if they receive regulatory approval and are unable to continue to develop our clinical candidates 
our manufacturing facility would be inadequate to produce the active pharmaceutical ingredients of a eylea  zaltrap  and arcalyst for the treatment of gout flares in sufficient commercial quantities if these late stage product candidates were all to receive regulatory approval  and b our earlier stage product candidates in sufficient clinical quantities if our clinical pipeline advances as planned 
in addition to expanding our internal capacity  we intend to rely on our corporate collaborators  as well as contract manufacturers  to produce commercial quantities of drug material needed for commercialization of our products to the extent such quantities are not manufactured at our own facility 
we rely entirely on third parties and our collaborators for filling and finishing services 
generally  in order for other parties to perform any step in the manufacturing and supply chain  we must transfer technology to the other party which can be time consuming and may not be successfully accomplished without considerable cost and expense  or at all 
we will have to depend on these other parties to perform effectively on a timely basis and to comply with regulatory requirements 
if for any reason they are unable to do so  and as a result we are unable to directly or through such third parties manufacture and supply sufficient commercial quantities of our products on acceptable terms  or if we should encounter delays or other difficulties in our relationships with our corporate collaborators  third party manufacturers  or other parties involved in our supply chain which adversely affect the timely manufacture and supply of our products  our business  prospects  operating results  and financial condition may be materially harmed 
expanding our manufacturing capacity will be costly and we may be unsuccessful in doing so in a timely manner  which could delay or prevent the launch and successful commercialization of our late stage product candidates or other indications for our marketed products if they are approved for marketing and could jeopardize our current and future clinical development programs 
expanding our manufacturing capacity to supply commercial quantities of the active pharmaceutical ingredients for our late stage product candidates if they are approved for marketing  and to supply clinical drug material to support the continued growth of our clinical programs  will require substantial additional expenditures  and we will need to hire and train significant numbers of employees and managerial personnel to staff our manufacturing and supply chain operations 
start up costs can be large and scale up entails significant risks related to process development and manufacturing yields 
in addition  we may face difficulties or delays in developing or acquiring the necessary production equipment and technology to manufacture sufficient quantities of our product candidates at reasonable costs and in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements 
the fda and analogous foreign regulatory authorities must determine that our existing and any expanded manufacturing facilities comply  or continue to comply  with cgmp requirements for both clinical and commercial production and license them  or continue to license them  accordingly  and such facilities must also comply with applicable environmental  safety  and other governmental permitting requirements 
we may not successfully expand or establish sufficient manufacturing capabilities or manufacture our products economically or in compliance with cgmps and other regulatory requirements  and we and our collaborators may not be able to build or procure additional capacity in the required timeframe to meet commercial demand for our late stage product candidates if they receive regulatory approval  and to continue to meet the requirements of our clinical programs 
this would interfere with our efforts to successfully commercialize eylea  zaltrap  and arcalyst for the prevention of gout flares in patients initiating uric acid lowering treatment if they receive regulatory approval  and could also delay or require us to discontinue one or more of our clinical development programs 
as a result  our business  prospects  operating results  and financial condition could be materially harmed 
our ability to manufacture our products may be impaired if any of our manufacturing activities  or the activities of third parties involved in our manufacture and supply chain  are found to infringe third party patents 
our ability to continue to manufacture arcalyst  eylea  and zaltrap in our rensselaer  new york facilities  or to utilize third parties to produce our products or perform fill finish services or other steps in our manufacture and supply chain  depends on our and their ability to operate without infringing the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties 
other parties may allege that our manufacturing activities  or the activities of third parties involved in our manufacture and supply chain  infringe patents or other intellectual property rights 
a judicial decision in favor of one or more parties making such allegations could preclude the manufacture of our products where those intellectual property rights apply which could materially harm our business  results of operations  and prospects 
if sales of eylea for the treatment of wet amd do not meet the levels currently expected  or if the launch of our late stage product candidates or new indications of our marketed products  or any of our clinical programs  are delayed or discontinued  we may face costs related to unused capacity at our manufacturing facilities and at the facilities of third parties 
we have large scale manufacturing operations in rensselaer  new york 
we use our facilities to produce bulk product of arcalyst for the treatment of caps  bulk product of eylea for the treatment of wet amd and clinical and preclinical candidates for ourselves and our collaborations  and plan to use such facilities to produce bulk product for commercial supply of our late stage product candidates or new indications of our marketed products if they are approved for marketing 
if our clinical candidates are discontinued or their clinical development is delayed  if the launch of any of our late stage product candidates or new indications or our marketed products is delayed or does not occur  or if such products are launched and subsequently recalled or marketing approval is rescinded  we may have to absorb one hundred percent of related overhead costs and inefficiencies  as well as similar costs of third party contract manufacturers performing services for us 
third party service or supply failures  or other failures  business interruptions  or natural disasters affecting our manufacturing facilities in rensselaer  new york or the facilities of any other party participating in the supply chain  would adversely affect our ability to supply our products 
we manufacture all of our bulk drug materials at our manufacturing facilities in rensselaer  new york 
we would be unable to manufacture these materials if our rensselaer facilities were to cease production due to regulatory requirements or action  business interruptions  labor shortages or disputes  contaminations  fire  natural disasters  or other problems at the facilities 
also  certain raw materials necessary for the manufacture and formulation of arcalyst and eylea and of our product candidates  including zaltrap  are provided by single source unaffiliated third party suppliers 
in addition  we rely on certain third parties to perform filling  finishing  distribution  laboratory testing  and other services related to the manufacture of arcalyst and our product candidates 
we would be unable to obtain these raw materials or services for an indeterminate period of time if any of these third parties were to cease or interrupt production or otherwise fail to supply these materials  products  or services to us for any reason  including due to regulatory requirements or action  adverse financial developments at or affecting the supplier  failure by the supplier to comply with cgmps  business interruptions  or labor shortages or disputes 
this  in turn  could materially and adversely affect our ability to manufacture or supply arcalyst for the treatment of caps and eylea for the treatment of wet amd and to manufacture and supply commercial quantities of eylea for other ophthalmologic diseases  zaltrap  and arcalyst for the prevention of gout flares if they receive regulatory approval  which could materially and adversely affect our business and future prospects 
certain of the raw materials required in the manufacture and the formulation of our product candidates may be derived from biological sources  including mammalian tissues  bovine serum  and human serum albumin 
there are certain european regulatory restrictions on using these biological source materials 
if we are required to substitute for these sources to comply with european regulatory requirements  our clinical development activities may be delayed or interrupted 
if we fail to meet the stringent requirements of governmental regulation in the manufacture of drug products or product candidates  we could incur substantial remedial costs  delays in the development or approval of our product candidates or new indications for our marketed products and or in their commercial launch if they obtain regulatory approval  and a reduction in sales 
we and our third party providers are required to maintain compliance with cgmp  and are subject to inspections by the fda or comparable agencies in other jurisdictions to confirm such compliance 
changes of suppliers or modifications of methods of manufacturing may require amending our application s to the fda or such comparable foreign agencies and acceptance of the change by the fda or such comparable foreign agencies prior to release of product s 
because we produce multiple product candidates at our facility in rensselaer  new york  including arcalyst  eylea  and zaltrap  there are increased risks associated with cgmp compliance 
our inability  or the inability of our third party fill finish or other service providers  to demonstrate ongoing cgmp compliance could require us to engage in lengthy and expensive remediation efforts  withdraw or recall product  halt or interrupt clinical trials  and or interrupt commercial supply of any marketed products  and could also delay or prevent our obtaining regulatory approval for our late stage product candidates or new indications for our marketed products 
any delay  interruption  or other issue that arises in the manufacture  fill finish  packaging  or storage of any drug product or product candidate as a result of a failure of our facilities or the facilities or operations of third parties to pass any regulatory agency inspection or maintain cgmp compliance could significantly impair our ability to develop  obtain approval for  and successfully commercialize our products  which would substantially harm our business and prospects 
any finding of non compliance could also increase our costs  cause us to delay the development of our product candidates  result in delay in our obtaining  or our not obtaining  regulatory approval of product candidates or new indications for our marketed products  and cause us to lose revenue from any marketed products  which could be seriously detrimental to our business  prospects  and financial condition 
risks related to commercialization of products we may be unsuccessful in continuing our commercialization of eylea for the treatment of wet amd or commercializing our late stage product candidates or new indications for our marketed products  if approved  which would materially delay or prevent our achieving profitability 
even if clinical trials demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of any of our product candidates for a specific disease and the necessary regulatory approvals are obtained  the commercial success of any of our product candidates or new indications for our marketed products will depend upon  among other things  their acceptance by patients  the medical community  and third party payers and on our and our collaborators ability to successfully manufacture and commercialize those products or new indications 
even if we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates or new indications  if they are not successfully commercialized  we will not be able to recover the significant investment we have made in developing such products and our business  prospects  operating results  and financial condition would be severely harmed 
in particular  we are in the early stages of commercialization and cannot be sure that eylea for the treatment of wet amd will be commercially successful in the pharmaceutical market 
in addition to the challenges we face related to a company launching its first major commercial drug  as described in detail in the risk factor immediately below  we and bayer healthcare will face intense competition from lucentis and from off label use of avastin  both of which have been on the market for a number of years 
we expect that the initial commercial success of eylea for the treatment of wet amd will depend on many factors  including the following the effectiveness of our and bayer healthcare s commercial strategies for the launch and marketing of eylea in and outside the united states  respectively  including pricing strategy and the effectiveness of efforts to obtain  and the timing of obtaining  adequate third party reimbursements  maintaining and successfully monitoring commercial manufacturing arrangements for eylea with third parties who perform fill finish or other steps in the manufacture of eylea to ensure that they meet our standards and those of regulatory authorities  including the fda  which extensively regulate and monitor pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities  our ability to meet the demand for commercial supplies of eylea  our ability to effectively communicate to the marketplace the benefits of the dosing regimen of eylea of every months after three initial monthly doses as compared to the monthly dosing regimen of lucentis  and the willingness of retinal specialists and patients to switch from lucentis or off label use of avastin to eylea for the treatment of wet amd  the ability of patients  retinal specialists  and other providers to obtain and maintain sufficient coverage and reimbursement from third party payors  including medicare and medicaid in the united states and other government and private payors in the united states and foreign jurisdictions  and the effect of new health care legislation currently being implemented in the united states 
while we believe that eylea for the treatment of wet amd has a commercially competitive profile  we cannot predict whether ophthalmologists  particularly retinal specialists  and patients  will accept or utilize eylea 
our and bayer healthcare s efforts to educate the relevant medical community and third party payors regarding the benefits of eylea for the treatment of wet amd will require significant resources and may not be successful in achieving our objectives 
if eylea is approved for marketing but does not achieve significant market acceptance for the treatment of wet amd  our ability to achieve profitability would be materially impaired or delayed 
if we are unable to establish  and effectively deploy and manage  sales  marketing  and distribution capabilities in the applicable markets or to enter into agreements with third parties to do so  we will not generate our expected sales of eylea for treatment of wet amd or successfully launch and commercialize our late stage product candidates or new indications for our marketed products if they receive regulatory approval  which would materially harm our business  prospects  operating results  and financial condition 
we currently sell eylea in the united states to three distributors and several specialty pharmacies 
we currently sell arcalyst for the treatment of caps in the united states to two specialty pharmacies 
under these distribution models  we enter into written contracts with our distributors and specialty pharmacies collectively  our customers  and our customers generally take physical delivery of product 
for eylea  the distributors and specialty pharmacies generally sell the product directly to healthcare providers  whereas for arcalyst  the specialty pharmacies sell the product directly to patients 
we have established our own sales and marketing organization for eylea in the united states for the treatment of wet amd  and in anticipation of filing for and receiving regulatory approval to market and sell eylea in the united states for the treatment of crvo 
however  we may be unsuccessful in achieving a successful commercialization of eylea in the united states  which would materially harm our business  prospects  operating results  and financial condition 
we will have to rely on a third party or devote significant resources to develop our own sales and marketing capabilities  and our distribution network  for arcalyst for patients with gout initiating uric acid lowering drug therapy if it receives regulatory approval 
if we are unable to obtain these capabilities  either by developing our own organizations or entering into agreements with others to provide these functions  even if arcalyst for the prevention of gout flares receives marketing approval  we will not be able to successfully launch and commercialize this product  which would also materially harm our business  prospects  operating results  and financial condition 
we have limited experience in sales  marketing  or distribution of products in substantial commercial quantities or in establishing and managing the required infrastructure to do so  including large scale information technology systems and a large scale distribution network  and we may be unable to establish such infrastructure on a timely basis 
to the extent we determine to utilize third parties to provide sales  marketing  or distribution capabilities for arcalyst for the prevention of gout flares or any of our other product candidates or new indications for marketed products if they receive regulatory approval  we may encounter difficulties in retaining such parties on acceptable terms 
even if we hire qualified sales and marketing personnel  and establish the required infrastructure we need to support our objectives  or enter into marketing and distribution agreements with third parties on acceptable terms  we may not do so in an efficient manner or on a timely basis 
we may not be able to correctly judge the size and experience of the sales and marketing force and the scale of distribution capabilities necessary to successfully market and sell in the united states eylea  arcalyst for the prevention of gout flares  or any of our other product candidates or new indications if they receive regulatory approval in the united states and as to which we retain sales and marketing responsibility in that market 
establishing and maintaining sales  marketing  and distribution capabilities are expensive and time consuming 
our expenses associated with building up and maintaining a sales force and distribution capabilities may be disproportional  particularly in the near term  compared to the revenues we may be able to generate on sales in the united states of eylea or arcalyst for the prevention of gout flares 
ultimately neither we nor our collaborators may be successful in commercializing eylea  zaltrap  arcalyst for the prevention of gout flares  or any of our other product candidates 
under the terms of our collaboration agreement  sanofi has primary responsibility for sales  marketing  and distribution of zaltrap in cancer indications  should it be approved in the future by regulatory authorities for marketing 
we currently have no sales  marketing  commercial  or distribution capabilities outside the united states 
under the terms of our license and collaboration agreement with bayer healthcare  we will rely on bayer healthcare for sales  marketing  and distribution of eylea in countries outside the united states should it be approved for marketing in such countries 
the commercial success of eylea currently being marketed for the treatment of wet amd  and for our other product candidates or new indications for our marketed products  if any are approved for marketing  is highly uncertain given their method of administration  and because our competitors have received approval for and may be marketing products with a similar mechanism of action or may enter the marketplace with better or lower cost drugs 
our product candidates are delivered either by intravenous infusion or by intravitreal or subcutaneous injections  which are generally less well received by patients than tablet or capsule delivery and this could adversely affect the commercial success of those products if they receive marketing approval 
there is substantial competition in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries from biotechnology  pharmaceutical  and chemical companies 
many of our competitors have substantially greater research  preclinical and clinical product development and manufacturing capabilities  and financial  marketing  and human resources than we do 
our smaller competitors may also enhance their competitive position if they acquire or discover patentable inventions  form collaborative arrangements  or merge with large pharmaceutical companies 
even if we achieve commercialization of our product candidates  our competitors have achieved  and may continue to achieve  product commercialization before our products are approved for marketing and sale 
as previously noted  genentech has an approved vegf antagonist  avastin  on the market for treating certain cancers and many different pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are working to develop competing vegf antagonists  including novartis  amgen  imclone llc eli lilly  pfizer  astrazeneca  and glaxosmithkline 
some of these molecules are further along in development than zaltrap and may offer competitive advantages over our molecule 
each of pfizer  onyx together with its partner bayer healthcare  and glaxosmithkline are marketing and selling oral medications that target tumor cell growth and new vasculature formation that fuels the growth of tumors 
the marketing approvals for genentech s vegf antagonist  avastin  and their extensive  ongoing clinical development plan for avastin in other cancer indications  make it more difficult for us to enroll patients in clinical trials to support zaltrap for those indications and to obtain regulatory approval of zaltrap in those indications 
this may delay or impair our ability to successfully develop and commercialize zaltrap for various cancer indications 
in addition  even if zaltrap is approved for sale for the treatment of certain cancers  it will be difficult for our drug to compete against avastin and the fda approved kinase inhibitors  because doctors and patients will have significant experience using these medicines 
in addition  an oral medication may be considerably less expensive for patients than a biologic medication  providing a competitive advantage to companies that market such products 
the market for eye disease products is also very competitive 
novartis and genentech are collaborating on the commercialization and further development of a vegf antibody fragment  lucentis for the treatment of wet amd  crvo  dme  and other eye indications 
lucentis was approved by the fda in june for the treatment of wet amd and in june for the treatment of macular edema following retinal vein occlusion rvo  crvo  and branch retinal vein occlusion brvo 
lucentis was also approved by the ema for wet amd in january and for dme in january many other companies are working on the development of product candidates for the potential treatment of wet amd and dme including those that act by blocking vegf and vegf receptors  as well as small interfering ribonucleic acids sirnas that modulate gene expression 
in addition  ophthalmologists are using off label  with success for the treatment of wet amd  dme  and rvo  third party repackaged versions of genentech s approved vegf antagonist  avastin 
the national eye institute nei and others are conducting long term  controlled clinical trials comparing lucentis to avastin in the treatment of wet amd 
one year data from the comparison of age related macular degeneration treatments trial catt were reported in april and indicated that avastin dosed monthly was non inferior to lucentis dosed monthly in the primary efficacy endpoint of mean visual acuity gain at weeks 
it may be difficult for eylea in this or other eye indications for which it may be approved to compete against lucentis and off label use of avastin because doctors and patients have had significant experience using these medicines 
moreover  the recently reported results of the catt study  combined with the relatively low cost of avastin in treating patients with wet amd  may well exacerbate the competitive challenge which eylea will face in this or other eye indications for which it may be approved 
in addition  while we believe that zaltrap would not be well tolerated if administered directly to the eye  if zaltrap is approved for the treatment of certain cancers  there is a risk that third parties will attempt to repackage zaltrap for off label use and sale for the treatment of wet amd and other diseases of the eye  which would present a potential low cost competitive threat to eylea for wet amd or other eye indications 
the availability of highly effective fda approved tumor necrosis factors antagonists tnf antagonists such as enbrel  remicade  humira adalimumab  a registered trademark of abbott laboratories  simponi golimumab  a registered trademark of johnson johnson  the il receptor antagonist kineret  ilaris canakinumab  and other marketed therapies makes it more difficult to successfully develop and commercialize arcalyst in indications other than caps  and this is one of the reasons we discontinued the development of arcalyst in adult rheumatoid arthritis 
in addition  even if arcalyst is ever approved for sale in indications where tnf antagonists are approved  it will be difficult for our drug to compete against these fda approved tnf antagonists because doctors and patients have had significant experience using these effective medicines 
moreover  in such indications these approved therapeutics may offer competitive advantages over arcalyst  such as requiring fewer injections 
there are both small molecules and antibodies in development by other companies that are designed to block the synthesis of il or inhibit the signaling of il for example  eli lilly  xoma in collaboration with servier  and novartis are each developing antibodies to il and both amgen and medimmune are developing antibodies to the il receptor 
in  novartis received regulatory approval in the united states and europe for ilaris  a fully human anti interleukin il antibody  for the treatment of caps 
ilaris is also in development for atherosclerosis and a number of other inflammatory diseases 
novartis il antibody and these other drug candidates could offer competitive advantages over arcalyst 
for example  ilaris is dosed once every eight weeks compared to the once weekly dosing regimen for arcalyst 
the successful development and or commercialization of these competing molecules could adversely affect sales of arcalyst for the treatment of caps and delay or impair our ability to commercialize arcalyst for indications other than caps 
we are developing arcalyst for the prevention of gout flares in patients initiating uric acid lowering therapy and have submitted a supplemental bla filing for us regulatory approval in this indication 
in january  novartis announced that the results of two phase studies with ilaris focused on reducing pain and preventing recurrent attacks or flares in patients with hard to treat gout were positive 
novartis has also reported that regulatory filings for the use of ilaris in gouty arthritis have been completed in the european union in and in the united states in the first quarter of  based on the results of these two phase studies 
ilaris is dosed less frequently for the treatment of caps  and if it is approved for the treatment of gout  it may be perceived by some physicians as offering competitive advantages over arcalyst  which would make it difficult for us to successfully commercialize arcalyst in that disease 
currently  inexpensive  oral therapies such as analgesics and other nsaids  are used as the standard of care to treat the symptoms of gout diseases 
these established  inexpensive  orally delivered drugs may make it difficult for us to successfully commercialize arcalyst in these diseases 
our earlier stage clinical candidates in development are all fully human monoclonal antibodies  which were generated using our velocimmune technology 
our antibody generation technologies and earlier stage clinical candidates face competition from many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies using various technologies 
numerous other companies are developing therapeutic antibody products 
companies such as pfizer  johnson johnson  astrazeneca  amgen  biogen idec  novartis  genentech roche  bristol myers squib  abbott  and glaxosmithkline have generated therapeutic products that are currently in development or on the market that are derived from recombinant dna that comprise human antibody sequences 
we are aware of several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies actively engaged in the research and development of antibody products against targets that are also the targets of our early stage product candidates 
for example  pfizer  johnson johnson  and abbott are developing antibody product candidates against ngf 
genentech roche is marketing an antibody against il r tocilizumab for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis  and several other companies  including centocor johnson johnson  and bristol myers squibb  have antibodies against il in clinical development for this disease 
glaxosmithkline  in partnership with oncomed pharmaceuticals  has a dll antibody in clinical development for the treatment of solid tumors 
aerovance has two formulations of a biologic directed against il in clinical development 
amgen previously had an antibody against il r in clinical development for the treatment of asthma 
we believe that several companies  including amgen and pfizer  have development programs for antibodies against pcsk amgen  pfizer  and astrazeneca have development programs underway for antibodies against ang if any of these or other competitors announces a successful clinical study involving a product that may be competitive with one of our product candidates or the grant of marketing approval by a regulatory agency for a competitive product  such developments may have an adverse effect on our business or future prospects 
the successful commercialization of eylea for the treatment of wet amd as well as our late stage product candidates or new indications for our marketed products  if approved  will depend on obtaining coverage and reimbursement for use of these products from third party payers  including medicare and medicaid in the united states  and these payers may not agree to cover or adequately reimburse for use of our products or may do so at levels that make our products uncompetitive and or unprofitable  which would materially harm our business  prospects  operating results  and financial condition 
our product candidates  if commercialized  may be significantly more expensive than traditional drug treatments 
for example  we are developing arcalyst for the prevention of gout flares in patients initiating uric acid lowering drug therapy 
patients suffering from this gout indication are currently treated with inexpensive therapies  including nsaids 
these existing treatment options are likely to be considerably less expensive and may be preferable to a biologic medication for some patients 
our future revenues and profitability will be adversely affected in a material manner if united states and foreign governmental  private third party insurers and payers  and other third party payers  including medicare and medicaid  do not agree to defray or reimburse the cost of our products to the patients 
if these entities do not provide coverage and reimbursement with respect to our products or provide an insufficient level of coverage and reimbursement  our products may be too costly for many patients to afford them  and physicians may not prescribe them 
many third party payers cover only selected drugs  making drugs that are not preferred by such payers more expensive for patients  and require prior authorization or failure on another type of treatment before covering a particular drug 
in particular  payers may impose these obstacles to coverage on higher priced drugs  as our product candidates are likely to be 
government and other third party payers are challenging the prices charged for healthcare products and increasingly limiting  and attempting to limit  both coverage and level of reimbursement for prescription drugs 
in march  the ppaca and a related reconciliation bill were enacted in the united states 
this legislation imposes cost containment measures that are likely to adversely affect the amount of reimbursement for our future products 
the full effects of this legislation are unknown at this time and will not be known until regulations and guidance are issued by cms and other federal and state agencies 
further  in september the office of inspector general oig of the department of health and human services issued a report entitled review of medicare part b avastin and lucentis treatments for age related macular degeneration in which the oig details possible savings to the medicare program by using off label avastin rather than lucentis for the treatment of wet amd 
some states are also considering legislation that would control the prices of drugs  and state medicaid programs are increasingly requesting manufacturers to pay supplemental rebates and requiring prior authorization by the state program for use of any drug for which supplemental rebates are not being paid 
it is likely that federal and state legislatures and health agencies will continue to focus on additional health care reform in the future that will impose additional constraints on prices and reimbursements for our products 
since eylea for the treatment of wet amd and other eye diseases  zaltrap for oncology indications  and arcalyst for the prevention of gout flares will likely be too expensive for most patients to afford without health insurance coverage  if these products are unable to obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement by third party payers  including medicare and medicaid in the united states  our ability to successfully commercialize these products would be materially adversely impacted 
the status of a j code for our marketed products could also affect reimbursement 
j codes are permanent reimbursement codes maintained by cms that are a component of hcpcs  and are typically used to report injectable drugs that ordinarily cannot be self administered 
although we have a j code for arcalyst  we do not currently have a j code for eylea  although we anticipate assignment of a j code for eylea in january without a unique j code identifier  eylea must be billed using a non specific miscellaneous j code 
since such codes may be used for a wide variety of products  health plans may have more difficulty determining the actual product used and billed for the patient 
as a result  these claims must often be submitted with additional information and manually processed  which can create delays in claims processing times as well as increasing the likelihood for claim errors 
third party payers  including medicare and medicaid in the united states  may not cover and or reimburse for these products at levels required for us to successfully commercialize these products 
any limitation imposed by third party payers on the use of our products if they are approved for marketing  any action or decision by cms or analogous foreign agencies or authorities which for any reason denies coverage or reimbursement for our products or provides coverage or reimbursement at levels that harm our products competitiveness or leads to lower prices for those products  will have a material negative effect on our ability to achieve profitability 
in certain foreign countries  pricing  coverage  and level of reimbursement of prescription drugs are subject to governmental control  and we and our collaborators may be unable to obtain coverage  pricing  and or reimbursement on terms that are favorable to us or necessary for us or our collaborators to successfully commercialize our products in those countries 
in some foreign countries  the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed 
the requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country 
for example  the european union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use 
a member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market 
our results of operations may suffer if we or our collaborators are unable to market our products in foreign countries or if coverage and reimbursement for our products in foreign countries is limited or delayed 
regulatory and litigation risks if the testing or use of our products harms people  we could be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims 
the testing  manufacturing  marketing  and sale of drugs for use in people expose us to product liability risk 
any informed consent or waivers obtained from people who enroll in our clinical trials may not protect us from liability or the cost of litigation 
we may also be subject to claims by patients who use our approved products  arcalyst for the treatment of caps  or eylea for the treatment of wet amd  or eylea for other indications  zaltrap  or arcalyst for the prevention of gout flares if those product candidates receive regulatory approval and become commercially available  that they have been injured by a side effect associated with the drug 
we may face product liability claims and be found responsible even if injury arises from the acts or omissions of our third party fill finish or other providers 
our product liability insurance may not cover all potential liabilities or may not completely cover any liability arising from any such litigation 
moreover  in the future we may not have access to liability insurance or be able to maintain our insurance on acceptable terms 
if we market and sell approved products  in a way that violates federal or state healthcare laws  we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties 
in addition to fda and related regulatory requirements  we are subject to health care fraud and abuse laws  such as the federal false claims act  the anti kickback provisions of the federal social security act  and other state and federal laws and regulations 
federal and state anti kickback laws prohibit  among other things  payments or other remuneration to induce or reward someone to purchase  prescribe  endorse  or recommend a product that is reimbursed under federal or state healthcare programs 
if we provide payments or other remuneration to a healthcare professional to induce the prescribing of our products  we could face liability under state and federal anti kickback laws 
federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting  or causing to be presented  a false claim for payment to the federal government  or knowingly making  or causing to be made  a false statement to get a false claim paid 
pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under these laws for a variety of alleged promotional and marketing activities  such as allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product  reporting to pricing services inflated average wholesale prices that were then used by federal programs to set reimbursement rates  engaging in promotion for uses that the fda has not approved  known as off label uses  that caused claims to be submitted to medicaid for non covered off label uses  and submitting inflated best price information to the medicaid rebate program 
the majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti kickback law and false claims laws  which apply to items and services reimbursed under medicaid and other state programs  or  in several states  apply regardless of the payer 
sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties  exclusion of a manufacturer s products from reimbursement under government programs  criminal fines  and imprisonment 
even if it is determined that we have not violated these laws  government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity  which would harm our business and financial results and condition 
because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the safe harbors  it is possible that some of our business activities could be challenged under one or more of such laws 
in recent years  several states and localities  including california  the district of columbia  massachusetts  minnesota  nevada  new mexico  vermont  and west virginia  have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing compliance programs  and file periodic reports with the state or make periodic public disclosures on sales  marketing  pricing  clinical trials  and other activities 
similar requirements are being considered in other states 
in addition  as part of the ppaca  pharmaceutical companies will be required to file reports with the federal government regarding payments made to healthcare professionals 
many of these requirements are new and uncertain  and the penalties for failure to comply with these requirements are unclear 
nonetheless  if we are found not to be in full compliance with these laws  we could face enforcement actions  fines  and other penalties  and could receive adverse publicity  which would harm our business and financial results and condition 
risks from the improper conduct of employees  agents or contractors or collaborators could adversely affect our business or reputation 
we cannot ensure that our compliance controls  policies  and procedures will in every instance protect us from acts committed by our employees  agents  contractors  or collaborators that would violate the laws or regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate  including without limitation  healthcare  employment  foreign corrupt practices  environmental  competition  and privacy laws 
such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations  monetary and injunctive penalties and could adversely impact our ability to conduct business  results of operations  and reputation 
our operations may involve hazardous materials and are subject to environmental  health  and safety laws and regulations 
compliance with these laws and regulations is costly  and we may incur substantial liability arising from our activities involving the use of hazardous materials 
as a biopharmaceutical company with significant manufacturing operations  we are subject to extensive environmental  health  and safety laws and regulations  including those governing the use of hazardous materials 
our research and development and manufacturing activities involve the controlled use of chemicals  viruses  radioactive compounds  and other hazardous materials 
the cost of compliance with environmental  health  and safety regulations is substantial 
if an accident involving these materials or an environmental discharge were to occur  we could be held liable for any resulting damages  or face regulatory actions  which could exceed our resources or insurance coverage 
our business is subject to increasingly complex corporate governance  public disclosure  and accounting requirements and regulations that could adversely affect our business and financial results and condition 
we are subject to changing rules and regulations of various federal and state governmental authorities as well as the stock exchange on which our common stock is listed 
these entities  including the public company accounting oversight board pcaob  the securities and exchange commission sec  and the nasdaq stock market llc  have issued a significant number of new and increasingly complex requirements and regulations over the course of the last several years and continue to develop additional requirements and regulations in response to laws enacted by congress  including the sarbanes oxley act of and  most recently  the dodd frank wall street reform and protection act  or the dodd frank act 
there are significant corporate governance and executive compensation related provisions in the dodd frank act that expressly authorized or required the sec to adopt additional rules in these areas  such as shareholder approval of executive compensation so called say on pay and proxy access 
on january   the sec adopted final rules concerning say on pay 
our efforts to comply with these requirements and regulations have resulted in  and are likely to continue to result in  an increase in expenses and a diversion of management s time from other business activities 
changes in laws and regulations affecting the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business 
all aspects of our business  including research and development  manufacturing  marketing  pricing  sales  litigation  and intellectual property rights  are subject to extensive legislation and regulation 
changes in applicable federal and state laws and agency regulations could have a materially negative impact on our business 
these include changes in the fda and foreign regulatory processes for new therapeutics that may delay or prevent the approval of any of our current or future product candidates  new laws  regulations  or judicial decisions related to healthcare availability or the payment for healthcare products and services  including prescription drugs  that would make it more difficult for us to market and sell products once they are approved by the fda or foreign regulatory agencies  changes in fda and foreign regulations that may require additional safety monitoring prior to or after the introduction of new products to market  which could materially increase our costs of doing business  and changes in fda and foreign cgmps that may make it more difficult and costly for us to maintain regulatory compliance and or manufacture our marketed product and product candidates in accordance with cgmps 
as described above  the ppaca and potential regulations thereunder easing the entry of competing follow on biologics into the marketplace  other new legislation or implementation of existing statutory provisions on importation of lower cost competing drugs from other jurisdictions  and legislation on comparative effectiveness research are examples of previously enacted and possible future changes in laws that could adversely affect our business 
risks related to our reliance on third parties if our antibody collaboration with sanofi is terminated  our business operations and financial condition  and our ability to discover  develop  manufacture  and commercialize our pipeline of product candidates in the time expected  or at all  would be materially harmed 
we rely heavily on funding from sanofi to support our target discovery and antibody research and development programs 
sanofi has committed to pay up to million per year  or a total of billion  between and to fund our efforts to identify and validate drug discovery targets and pre clinically develop fully human monoclonal antibodies against such targets 
sanofi has a one time option to adjust the maximum reimbursement amount down to million per year commencing in if over the prior two years certain specified criteria are not satisfied 
if this downward adjustment occurs  it will reduce our resources available for antibody discovery activities and negatively affect our clinical pipeline 
sanofi also initially funds almost all of the development expenses incurred by both companies in connection with the clinical development of antibodies that sanofi elects to co develop with us 
we rely on sanofi to fund these activities 
in addition  with respect to those antibodies that sanofi elects to co develop with us  such as sarilumab  regn  regn  regn  regn  regn  and regn  we rely on sanofi to lead much of the clinical development efforts and assist with obtaining regulatory approval  particularly outside the united states 
we also rely on sanofi to lead the commercialization efforts to support all of the antibody products that are co developed by sanofi and us if they receive regulatory approval 
if sanofi does not elect to co develop the antibodies that we discover or opts out of their development  we would be required to fund and oversee on our own the clinical trials  any regulatory responsibilities  and the ensuing commercialization efforts to support those antibody products 
for example  during and to date  sanofi elected not to continue co development of regn and regn  and decided not to opt in to the regn program 
if sanofi terminates the antibody collaboration or fails to comply with its payment obligations thereunder  our business  prospects  operating results  and financial condition would be materially harmed 
we would be required to either expend substantially more resources than we have anticipated to support our research and development efforts  which could require us to seek additional funding that might not be available on favorable terms or at all  or materially cut back on such activities 
even though none of the antibodies from this collaboration may ever be successfully developed and commercialized  if sanofi does not perform its obligations with respect to antibodies that it elects to co develop  our ability to develop  manufacture  and commercialize these antibody product candidates will be significantly adversely affected 
if our collaboration with sanofi for zaltrap is terminated  or sanofi materially breaches its obligations thereunder  our business operations  prospects  and financial condition  and our ability to develop  manufacture  and commercialize zaltrap in the time expected  or at all  would be materially harmed 
we rely heavily on sanofi to lead much of the development of zaltrap 
sanofi initially funds all of the development expenses incurred by both companies in connection with the zaltrap program 
if the zaltrap program continues  we will rely on sanofi to assist with funding the zaltrap program  provide commercial manufacturing capacity  enroll and monitor clinical trials  obtain regulatory approval  particularly outside the united states  and lead the commercialization of zaltrap 
while zaltrap may not ever be successfully developed and commercialized  if sanofi fails to perform its obligations in a timely manner  or at all  our ability to develop  manufacture  and commercialize zaltrap in cancer indications will be significantly adversely affected 
sanofi has the right to terminate its collaboration agreement with us at any time upon twelve months advance notice 
if sanofi were to terminate its collaboration agreement with us  we would not have the resources or skills to replace those of our partner  which could require us to seek additional funding that might not be available on favorable terms or at all  and could cause significant delays in the development and or manufacture of zaltrap and result in substantial additional costs to us 
we have limited commercial capabilities and would have to develop or outsource these capabilities 
termination of the sanofi collaboration agreement for zaltrap would create substantial new and additional risks to the successful development and commercialization of zaltrap 
if our collaboration with bayer healthcare for eylea is terminated  or bayer healthcare materially breaches its obligations thereunder  our business operations  prospects  and financial condition  and our ability to continue to develop eylea and commercialize eylea outside the united states in the time expected  or at all  would be materially harmed 
we rely heavily on bayer healthcare to assist with the development  and the commercialization outside the united states  of eylea 
under our agreement with them  bayer healthcare is required to fund approximately half of the development expenses incurred by both companies in connection with the global eylea development program 
as the eylea program continues  we will continue to rely on bayer healthcare to assist with funding the eylea development program  continue to lead the development of eylea outside the united states  obtain regulatory approval outside the united states  and provide all sales  marketing  and commercial support for the product outside the united states 
in particular  bayer healthcare has responsibility for selling eylea outside the united states using its sales force 
while we cannot assure you that eylea will receive regulatory approval in or outside the united states or be successfully commercialized  if bayer healthcare does not perform its obligations in a timely manner  or at all  our ability to develop  manufacture  and commercialize eylea outside the united states will be significantly adversely affected 
bayer healthcare has the right to terminate its collaboration agreement with us at any time upon six or twelve months advance notice  depending on the circumstances giving rise to termination 
if bayer healthcare were to terminate its collaboration agreement with us  we would not have the resources or skills to replace those of our partner  which could require us to seek additional funding or another collaboration that might not be available on favorable terms or at all  and could cause significant delays in the development and or commercialization of eylea outside the united states and result in substantial additional costs to us 
we currently have limited commercial capabilities and would have to develop or outsource these capabilities outside the united states 
termination of the bayer healthcare collaboration agreement would create substantial new and additional risks to the successful development and commercialization of eylea  particularly outside the united states 
our collaborators and service providers may fail to perform adequately in their efforts to support the development  manufacture  and commercialization of our drug candidates and current and future products 
we depend upon third party collaborators  including sanofi  bayer healthcare  and service providers such as cros  outside testing laboratories  clinical investigator sites  and third party manufacturers  fill finish  and product packagers and labelers  to assist us in the manufacture and preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates 
we also depend  or will depend  on some of these third parties in connection with the commercialization of eylea for the treatment of wet amd  arcalyst for the treatment of caps  and our late stage product candidates and new indications for our marketed products if they are approved for marketing 
if any of our existing collaborators or service providers breaches or terminates its agreement with us or does not perform its development or manufacturing services under an agreement in a timely manner or in compliance with applicable gmps  good laboratory practices glps  or gcp standards  we could experience additional costs  delays  and difficulties in the manufacture or development of  or in obtaining approval by regulatory authorities for and successfully commercializing  our product candidates 
we rely on third party service providers to support the distribution of eylea and arcalyst and for many other related activities in connection with the commercialization of these marketed products 
despite our arrangements with them  these third parties may not perform adequately 
if these service providers do not perform their services adequately  our sales of eylea for the treatment of wet amd and arcalyst for the treatment of caps will suffer 
risk related to employees we are dependent on our key personnel and if we cannot recruit and retain leaders in our research  development  manufacturing  and commercial organizations  our business will be harmed 
we are highly dependent on certain of our executive officers  other key members of our senior management team  and our chairman 
if we are not able to retain any of these persons  our business may suffer 
in particular  we depend on the services of p 
roy vagelos  md  the chairman of our board of directors  leonard s 
schleifer  md  md  our president and chief executive officer  george d 
yancopoulos  md  md  our executive vice president  chief scientific officer and president  regeneron research laboratories  and neil stahl  phd  our senior vice president  research and development sciences 
as we commercialize eylea in the united states for the treatment of wet amd and prepare for commercialization in the united states of eylea for the treatment of crvo and arcalyst for the treatment of gout flares in patients initiating uric acid lowering therapy  should they receive regulatory approval  we will also be highly dependent on the expertise and services of members of our senior management leading these commercialization efforts 
there is intense competition in the biotechnology industry for qualified scientists and managerial personnel in the development  manufacture  and commercialization of drugs 
we may not be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary to continue to advance our business and achieve our strategic objectives 
information technology risks significant disruptions of information technology systems or breaches of data security could adversely affect our business 
our business is increasingly dependent on critical  complex  and interdependent information technology systems  including internet based systems  to support business processes as well as internal and external communications 
the size and complexity of our computer systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown  malicious intrusion  and computer viruses which may result in the impairment of production and key business processes 
in addition  our systems are potentially vulnerable to data security breaches whether by employees or others which may expose sensitive data to unauthorized persons 
such data security breaches could lead to the loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property  or could lead to the public exposure of personal information including sensitive personal information of our employees  clinical trial patients  customers  and others 
such disruptions and breaches of security could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  operating results  and financial condition 
risks related to our common stock our stock price is extremely volatile 
there has been significant volatility in our stock price and generally in the market prices of biotechnology companies securities 
various factors and events may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 
these factors include  by way of example announcement of actions by the fda or foreign regulatory authorities or their respective advisory committees regarding our  or our collaborators currently pending or future application s for regulatory approval of our product candidate s or new indications for our marketed products  announcement of submission of an application for regulatory approval of one or more of our product candidates or new indications for our marketed products  progress  delays  or adverse results in clinical trials  announcement of technological innovations or product candidates by us or competitors  fluctuations in our operating results  in particular  net product sales of  and profits from  eylea and  if any of our product candidates or our new indications for our marketed products receive regulatory approval  net product sales of  and profits from  these product candidates and new indications  market acceptance of  and fluctuations in market share for  our marketed products  especially eylea  and whether these factors  including our net products sales  underperform  meet  or exceed the expectations of investors or analysts  third party claims that our products or technologies infringe their patents  third party challenges to our patents in the european patent office and in the us patent and trademark office  public concern as to the safety or effectiveness of any of our marketed products or product candidates or new indications for our marketed products  including eylea  zaltrap  or arcalyst for the prevention of gout flares in patients initiating uric acid lowering therapy  pricing or reimbursement actions or decisions by government authorities or insurers affecting the coverage or reimbursement of any of our marketed products or competitors products  our ability to raise additional capital as needed on favorable terms  developments in our relationship with collaborative partners  developments in the biotechnology industry or in government regulation of healthcare  large sales of our common stock by our executive officers  directors  or significant shareholders  arrivals and departures of key personnel  and general market conditions 
the trading price of our common stock has been  and could continue to be  subject to wide fluctuations in response to these and other factors  including the sale or attempted sale of a large amount of our common stock in the market 
broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
future sales of our common stock by our significant shareholders or us may depress our stock price and impair our ability to raise funds in new share offerings 
a small number of our shareholders beneficially own a substantial amount of our common stock 
as of december   our six largest shareholders plus leonard s 
schleifer  m 
d  phd  our chief executive officer  beneficially owned of our outstanding shares of common stock  assuming  in the case of our chief executive officer  the conversion of his class a stock into common stock and the exercise of all options held by him which are exercisable within days of december  in september  sanofi then aventis pharmaceuticals inc purchased  newly issued  unregistered shares of our common stock  and in december sanofi purchased an additional  newly issued  unregistered shares of our common stock 
under our investor agreement  as amended  with sanofi  these shares may not be sold until december  except under limited circumstances and subject to earlier termination of these restrictions upon the occurrence of certain events 
in addition  in october  sanofi purchased an additional  shares of common stock in our underwritten public offering 
as of december   sanofi beneficially owned  shares of our common stock  representing approximately of the shares of common stock then outstanding 
if sanofi  or our other significant shareholders or we  sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that such sales may occur exists  the market price of our common stock could fall 
sales of common stock by our significant shareholders  including sanofi  also might make it more difficult for us to raise funds by selling equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate 
our existing shareholders may be able to exert significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval 
holders of class a stock  who are generally the shareholders who purchased their stock from us before our initial public offering  are entitled to ten votes per share  while holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share 
as of december   holders of class a stock held of the combined voting power of all shares of common stock and class a stock then outstanding 
these shareholders  if acting together  would be in a position to significantly influence the election of our directors and the vote on certain corporate transactions that require majority or supermajority approval of the combined classes  including mergers and other business combinations 
this may result in our taking corporate actions that other shareholders may not consider to be in their best interest and may affect the price of our common stock 
as of december  our current executive officers and directors beneficially owned of our outstanding shares of common stock  assuming conversion of their class a stock into common stock and the exercise of all options held by such persons which are exercisable within days of december   and of the combined voting power of our outstanding shares of common stock and class a stock  assuming the exercise of all options held by such persons which are exercisable within days of december   and our six largest shareholders plus leonard s 
schleifer  md  md our chief executive officer  beneficially owned of our outstanding shares of common stock  assuming  in the case of our chief executive officer  the conversion of his class a stock into common stock and the exercise of all options held by him which are exercisable within days of december  in addition  these seven shareholders held of the combined voting power of our outstanding shares of common stock and class a stock  assuming the exercise of all options held by our chief executive officer which are exercisable within days of december  pursuant to an investor agreement  as amended  sanofi has agreed to vote its shares  at sanofi s election  either as recommended by our board of directors or proportionally with the votes cast by our other shareholders  except with respect to certain change of control transactions  liquidation or dissolution  stock issuances equal to or exceeding of the then outstanding shares or voting rights of common stock and class a stock  and new equity compensation plans or amendments if not materially consistent with our historical equity compensation practices 
the anti takeover effects of provisions of our charter  by laws  and of new york corporate law and the contractual standstill provisions in our investor agreement with sanofi  could deter  delay  or prevent an acquisition or other change in control of us and could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
our restated certificate of incorporation  our by laws  and the new york business corporation law contain various provisions that could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or our management that shareholders may consider favorable or beneficial 
some of these provisions could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions 
these provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
these provisions include authorization to issue blank check preferred stock  which is preferred stock that can be created and issued by the board of directors without prior shareholder approval  with rights senior to those of our common stock and class a stock  a staggered board of directors  so that it would take three successive annual meetings to replace all of our directors  a requirement that removal of directors may only be effected for cause and only upon the affirmative vote of at least eighty percent of the outstanding shares entitled to vote for directors  as well as a requirement that any vacancy on the board of directors may be filled only by the remaining directors  a provision whereby any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of shareholders may be taken without a meeting  only if  prior to such action  all of our shareholders consent  the effect of which is to require that shareholder action may only be taken at a duly convened meeting  a requirement that any shareholder seeking to bring business before an annual meeting of shareholders must provide timely notice of this intention in writing and meet various other requirements  and under the new york business corporation law  in addition to certain restrictions which may apply to business combinations involving our company and an interested shareholder  a plan of merger or consolidation of our company must be approved by two thirds of the votes of all outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon 
see the risk factor immediately above captioned our existing shareholders may be able to exert significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval 
until the later of the fifth anniversaries of the expiration or earlier termination of our antibody collaboration agreements with sanofi or our zaltrap collaboration with sanofi  sanofi will be bound by certain standstill provisions  as amended  which contractually prohibit sanofi from acquiring more than certain specified percentages of our class a stock and common stock taken together or otherwise seeking to obtain control of our company 
in addition  we have a change in control severance plan and our chief executive officer has an employment agreement that provides severance benefits in the event our officers are terminated as a result of a change in control of our company 
many of our stock options issued under our long term incentive plan  as amended and restated  may become fully vested in connection with a change in control of our company  as defined in the plan 
these contractual provisions may also have the effect of deterring  delaying  or preventing an acquisition or other change in control 
risks relating to our convertible senior notes and related hedge transactions the convertible note hedges and warrant transactions we entered into in connection with our convertible senior notes issuance may affect the trading price of our common stock 
in connection with our offering of our convertible senior notes due october   we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with four financial institutions the hedge counterparties 
the convertible note hedge transactions are expected to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock and or offset potential cash payments in excess of the principal amount of the notes  as the case may be upon conversion of the notes 
in the event that the hedge counterparties fail to deliver shares to us or potential cash payments as the case may be as required under the convertible note hedge documents  we would not receive the benefit of such transactions 
separately  we also entered into warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties 
the warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect from the issuance of common stock pursuant to the warrants 
in connection with hedging these transactions  the hedge counterparties and or their affiliates may enter into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock  and may enter into  or may unwind  various derivative transactions and or purchase or sell our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to maturity of the notes and are likely to do so during any conversion period related to any conversion of the notes 
these activities could have the effect of increasing or preventing a decline in  or could have a negative effect on  the value of our common stock and could have the effect of increasing or preventing a decline in the value of our common stock during any cash settlement averaging period related to a conversion of the notes 
in addition  we intend to exercise options under the convertible note hedge transactions whenever notes are converted 
in order to unwind its hedge position with respect to the options we exercise  the hedge counterparties and or their affiliates may sell shares of our common stock or other securities in secondary market transactions or unwind various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock during the cash settlement averaging period for the converted notes 
the effect  if any  of any of these transactions and activities on the trading price of our common stock or the notes will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time  but any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock and the value of the notes 
the derivative transactions that the hedge counterparties and or their affiliates expect to enter into to hedge these transactions may include cash settled equity swaps referenced to our common stock 
in certain circumstances  the hedge counterparties and or their affiliates may have derivative positions that  when combined with the hedge counterparties and their affiliates ownership of our common stock  if any  would give them economic exposure to the return on a significant number of shares of our common stock 
the fundamental change provisions of our convertible senior notes and certain of the terms of the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us 
the fundamental change purchase rights  which will allow noteholders to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change  as defined in the indenture governing the notes  and the provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with make whole fundamental changes  as set forth in the indenture  may in certain circumstances delay or prevent a takeover of us and the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors 
in addition  upon the occurrence of certain extraordinary events  the convertible note hedge transactions would be exercised upon the conversion of notes  and the warrant transactions may be terminated 
it is possible that the proceeds we receive upon the exercise of the convertible note hedge transactions would be significantly lower than the amounts we would be required to pay upon termination of the warrant transactions 
such differences may result in the acquisition of us being on terms less favorable to our shareholders than it would otherwise be

item legal proceedings from time to time  we are a party to legal proceedings in the course of our business 
we do not expect any such current ordinary course legal proceedings to have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition 
genentech patent litigation we are aware of issued patents and pending patent applications owned by genentech that claim certain chimeric vegf receptors 
we do not believe that zaltrap or eylea infringe any valid claim in these patents or patent applications 
we are involved in five patent litigations with genentech  two in the united states and three in europe 
in november  we commenced a lawsuit against genentech in the us district court for the southern district of new york the court  seeking a declaratory judgment that no activities relating to our vegf trap infringe any valid claim of certain genentech patents referred to as the davis smyth patents the first davis smyth case 
genentech answered the complaint and asserted counterclaims that our prior or planned activities relating to vegf trap have infringed or will infringe claims of four of the five davis smyth patents and requested a judgment against us for damages  including for willful infringement  and other relief as the court deems appropriate 
on december   we entered into a non exclusive license and partial settlement agreement the agreement with genentech that covers making  using  and selling eylea in the united states for the prevention and treatment of human eye diseases and disorders in the united states 
under the agreement  we received a non exclusive license to the davis smyth patents  and certain other technology patents owned or co owned by genentech 
the agreement does not cover any non us patent rights or non us patent disputes  and does not cover any use of aflibercept other than for prevention and treatment of human eye diseases and disorders in the united states 
the first davis smyth case is continuing with respect to matters not covered by the agreement 
the agreement provides for us to make payments to genentech based on us sales of eylea through may   the date the davis smyth patents expire 
we will make a lump sum payment of million once cumulative us sales of eylea reach million 
we will also pay royalties of on cumulative us sales of eylea between million and billion and on any cumulative us sales of eylea over billion 
as a result of the agreement  on january  genentech filed a second amended answer and counterclaim in the first davis smyth case  in which it amended its counterclaims alleging infringement of four of the five davis smyth patents 
on december   genentech initiated a related case in the court against regeneron and sanofi alleging infringement of four of the five davis smyth patents by activities relating to vegf trap but excluding eylea the second davis smyth case 
as in the first davis smyth case  in the new complaint genentech requests a judgment against us for damages  including for willful infringement  and other relief as the court deems appropriate 
we believe genentech s claims in the first davis smyth case and the second davis smyth case are without merit and intend to continue to defend against all of genentech s remaining claims vigorously 
we have initiated patent related actions against genentech in germany  the united kingdom  and italy  and may initiate other actions in other countries outside the united states  which could have similar or other adverse outcomes that would materially harm our business and which  irrespective of the outcomes  may also entail significant costs and expenses

we currently have two marketed products in the united states  eylea aflibercept injection and arcalyst rilonacept  and a late stage product candidate  zaltrap aflibercept  which has been submitted for marketing approval in the united states and the european union by our collaborator sanofi  as described below 
in november  we received us marketing approval from the fda for eylea for the treatment of patients with wet amd 
wet amd is the leading cause of acquired blindness for people over the age of in the united states and europe 
in the united states  the wet amd market is approximately billion 
our net product sales of eylea in the fourth quarter of were million 
our operating results over the next several years will be largely dependent upon our ability to successfully commercialize eylea and the market penetration it achieves 
in  bayer healthcare submitted regulatory applications for marketing approval of eylea in wet amd in the european union  japan  and other countries 
in addition  we submitted a supplemental bla to the fda for marketing approval of eylea in crvo in the united states and  under pdufa  were granted a target date for an fda decision on our eylea supplemental bla of september  bayer healthcare also plans to submit regulatory applications in this indication in europe in late or early arcalyst rilonacept injection for subcutaneous use is available by prescription in the united states for the treatment of caps  including fcas and mws in adults and children and older 
caps are a group of rare  inherited  auto inflammatory conditions that afflict a small patient population 
net product sales of arcalyst in were million  and we do not expect future net product sales of arcalyst for the treatment of caps to be significant 
in november  the fda accepted for review a supplemental bla for marketing approval in the united states of arcalyst for the prevention of gout flares in patients initiating uric acid lowering therapy 
under pdufa  we were granted a target date for an fda decision on our arcalyst supplemental bla of july  sanofi submitted a regulatory application for marketing approval of zaltrap for the treatment of previously treated mcrc patients to the european medicines agency ema in the fourth quarter of  and the fda in early february we expect to incur substantial costs to prepare for potential commercialization of arcalyst for the treatment of gout flares in patients initiating uric acid lowering therapy and zaltrap for the treatment of previously treated mcrc patients and  if one or both receive regulatory approval  to fund the launch of the product s 
since inception  we have not generated any significant sales or profits from the commercialization of eylea  arcalyst  or any of our other product candidates 
we have product candidates in clinical development  all of which were discovered in our research laboratories 
our trap based  late stage programs are eylea  which is being developed for the treatment of additional serious eye diseases  zaltrap  which is being developed in oncology in collaboration with sanofi  and arcalyst  which is being developed for the prevention of gout flares in patients initiating uric acid lowering treatment 
our antibody based clinical programs include the following fully human monoclonal antibodies sarilumab regn  an antibody to the interleukin receptor il r  which is being developed in rheumatoid arthritis  regn  an antibody to proprotein convertase substilisin kexin type pcsk  which is being developed for low density lipoprotein ldl cholesterol reduction  regn  an antibody to the interleukin receptor il r  which is being developed in atopic dermatitis and eosinophilic asthma  regn  an antibody to delta like ligand dll  a novel angiogenesis target  which is being developed in oncology  regn  an antibody to angiopoietin ang  another novel angiogenesis target  which is being developed in oncology  regn  an antibody to nerve growth factor ngf  which is being developed for the treatment of pain currently on clinical hold  regn  an antibody in clinical development against an undisclosed target  regn  an antibody in clinical development against an undisclosed target  regn  an antibody in clinical development against an undisclosed target  which is being developed in atopic dermatitis  and regn  an antibody in clinical development against an undisclosed target 
with the exception of regn  regn  and regn  which we are developing independently  all of these antibodies are being developed in collaboration with sanofi 
developing and commercializing new medicines entails significant risk and expense 
before significant revenues from the commercialization of our antibody candidates or new indications for our marketed products can be realized  we or our collaborators must overcome a number of hurdles which include successfully completing research and development and obtaining regulatory approval from the fda and regulatory authorities in other countries 
in addition  the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are rapidly evolving and highly competitive  and new developments may render our products and technologies uncompetitive or obsolete 
historically  we have generally incurred net losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception in our potential to generate profits and positive cash flow from operations over the next several years depends significantly on our success in commercializing eylea  otherwise  we expect to continue to incur operating losses 
we expect to continue to incur substantial expenses related to our research and development activities  a significant portion of which we expect to be reimbursed by our collaborators 
also  our research and development activities outside our collaborations  the costs of which are not reimbursed  may expand and require additional resources 
our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and will depend on  among other factors  the net sales of our marketed products  as well as the scope and progress of our research and development efforts  the timing of certain expenses  and the amount of reimbursement that we receive from collaborators 
we cannot predict whether or when zaltrap or new indications for our marketed products will receive regulatory approval or  if any such approval is received  whether we will be able to successfully commercialize such product s and whether or when they may become profitable 
a primary driver of our expenses is our number of full time employees 
our annual average headcount in was  compared with  in and in in  our average headcount increased primarily to support our expanded research and development activities in connection with our antibody collaboration with sanofi and in connection with commercializing eylea for the treatment of wet amd 
in  we expect our average headcount to increase to approximately  primarily to support antibody manufacturing at our rensselaer  new york manufacturing facilities  and activities in connection with preparing for the potential commercialization of arcalyst for the prevention of gout flares in patients initiating uric acid lowering treatment 
the planning  execution  and results of our clinical programs are significant factors that can affect our operating and financial results

management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires an assumption or assumptions regarding a future outcome  and changes in the estimate or the use of different assumptions to prepare the estimate could have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
management believes the current assumptions used to estimate amounts reflected in our financial statements are appropriate 
however  if actual experience differs from the assumptions used in estimating amounts reflected in our financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  and in certain situations  could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition 
the critical accounting estimates that impact our financial statements are described below 
revenue recognition collaboration revenue we earn collaboration revenue in connection with collaboration agreements to develop and commercialize product candidates and utilize our technology platforms 
we currently have collaboration agreements with sanofi and bayer healthcare 
the terms of collaboration agreements typically include non refundable up front licensing payments  research progress milestone payments  and payments for development activities 
non refundable up front license payments  where continuing involvement is required of us  are deferred and recognized over the related performance period 
we estimate our performance period based on the specific terms of each agreement  and adjust the performance periods  if appropriate  based on the applicable facts and circumstances 
although we did not enter into  or materially modify  any collaboration arrangements with multiple deliverables in  any future arrangements with multiple deliverables will be divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement meet certain criteria  including whether the delivered item or items has value to the collaborator on a standalone basis 
payments which are based on achieving a specific performance milestone  involving a degree of risk  are recognized as revenue when the milestone is achieved and the related payment is due and non refundable  provided there is no future service obligation associated with that milestone 
substantive performance milestones typically consist of significant achievements in the development life cycle of the related product candidate  such as completion of clinical trials  filing for approval with regulatory agencies  and receipt of approvals by regulatory agencies 
in determining whether a payment is deemed to be a substantive performance milestone  we take into consideration i the enhancement in value to the related development product candidate  ii our performance and the relative level of effort required to achieve the milestone  iii whether the milestone relates solely to past performance  and iv whether the milestone payment is considered reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms 
payments for achieving milestones which are not considered substantive are deferred and recognized over the related performance period 
we enter into collaboration agreements that include varying arrangements regarding which parties perform and bear the costs of research and development activities 
we may share the costs of research and development activities with our collaborator  such as in our eylea collaboration with bayer healthcare  or we may be reimbursed for all or a significant portion of the costs of our research and development activities  such as in our zaltrap and antibody collaborations with sanofi 
we record our internal and third party development costs associated with these collaborations as research and development expenses 
when we are entitled to reimbursement of all or a portion of the research and development expenses that we incur under a collaboration  we record those reimbursable amounts as collaboration revenue proportionately as we recognize our expenses 
if the collaboration is a cost sharing arrangement in which both we and our collaborator perform development work and share costs  in periods when our collaborator incurs development expenses that benefit the collaboration and regeneron  we also recognize  as additional research and development expense  the portion of the collaborator s development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse 
in certain cases  we may also share the costs of pre launch commercialization activities with our collaborators 
we record our share of these costs as a reduction of collaboration revenue 
in connection with non refundable licensing payments  our performance period estimates are principally based on projections of the scope  progress  and results of our research and development activities 
due to the variability in the scope of activities and length of time necessary to develop a drug product  changes to development plans as programs progress  and uncertainty in the ultimate requirements to obtain governmental approval for commercialization  revisions to performance period estimates are likely to occur periodically  and could result in material changes to the amount of revenue recognized each year in the future 
in addition  our estimated performance periods may change if development programs encounter delays or we and our collaborators decide to expand or contract our clinical plans for a drug candidate in various disease indications 
also  if a collaborator terminates an agreement in accordance with the terms of the agreement  we would recognize any unamortized remainder of an up front or previously deferred payment at the time of the termination 
product revenue product sales consist of us sales of our two marketed products  eylea and arcalyst 
revenue from product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title to product and associated risk of loss have passed to the customer  the price is fixed or determinable  collection from the customer is reasonably assured  we have no further performance obligations  and returns can be reasonably estimated 
our written contracts with our distributors and specialty pharmacies collectively  our customers stipulate that product is shipped freight on board destination fob destination 
we record revenue from product sales upon delivery to our customers 
we sell eylea in the united states to three distributors and several specialty pharmacies 
we sell arcalyst in the united states to two specialty pharmacies 
under these distribution models  the distributors and specialty pharmacies generally take physical delivery of product 
for eylea  the distributors and specialty pharmacies generally sell the product directly to healthcare providers  whereas for arcalyst  the specialty pharmacies sell the product directly to patients 
revenue from product sales are recorded net of applicable provisions for prompt pay discounts  rebates and chargebacks under governmental programs including medicaid  product returns  distribution related fees  and other sales related deductions 
calculating these provisions involves estimates and judgments 
we review our estimates of rebates  chargebacks  and other applicable provisions each period and record any necessary adjustments in the current period s net product sales 
prompt pay discounts no prompt pay discounts are currently offered to our customers on sales of eylea 
in connection with sales of arcalyst  we offer discounts to our customers for prompt payments 
we estimate these discounts based on customer terms and historical experience  and expect that our customers will always take advantage of this discount 
therefore  we accrue of the prompt pay discount that is based on the gross amount of each arcalyst invoice at the time of sale 
our accrual for prompt pay discounts was not material at december  and government rebates and chargebacks we estimate reductions to product sales for medicaid and veterans administration va programs  and for certain other qualifying federal and state government programs 
based upon our contracts with government agencies  statutorily defined discounts applicable to government funded programs  historical experience  and  in the case of eylea  estimated payer mix based on third party market research data  we estimate and record an allowance for rebates and chargebacks 
our liability for medicaid rebates consists of estimates for claims that a state will make for a current quarter  claims for prior quarters that have been estimated for which an invoice has not been received  and invoices received for claims from prior quarters that have not been paid 
our reserves related to discounted pricing offered to va  public health services phs  and other institutions collectively  qualified healthcare providers represent our estimated obligations resulting from contractual commitments to sell products to qualified healthcare providers at prices lower than the list prices we charge to our customers 
our customers charge us for the difference between what they pay for the products and the ultimate selling price to the qualified healthcare providers 
our reserve for this discounted pricing is based on expected sales to qualified healthcare providers and the chargebacks that customers have already claimed 
our government rebate and chargeback accruals were million at december   which was based on a percentage of gross sales 
government rebate and chargeback accruals were not material at december  product returns consistent with industry practice  we offer our customers a limited right to return product purchased directly from us  which is principally based upon the product s expiration date 
we will accept returns for three months prior to and up to six months after the product expiration date 
product returned is generally not resalable given the nature of our products and method of administration 
we develop estimates for product returns based upon historical experience  inventory levels in the distribution channel  and other relevant factors 
we have developed estimates for eylea product returns  based on several factors  including i our historical experience to date  and our expectation  that our customers will not stock significant supplies of eylea due to contractual limitations and other mitigating circumstances  ii historical industry information regarding product return rates for similar specialty products  and iii the shelf life of the product 
estimates for arcalyst product returns have been developed based primarily on our historical returns experience  to date  actual arcalyst product returns have been negligible 
we monitor product supply levels in the distribution channel  as well as sales by our customers of eylea to healthcare providers and arcalyst to patients using product specific data provided by our customers 
if necessary  our estimates of product returns may be adjusted in the future based on actual returns experience  known or expected changes in the marketplace  or other factors 
our product returns accruals were not material at december  or distribution related fees we have written contracts with our customers that include terms for distribution related fees 
we estimate and record distribution and related fees due to our customers based on a percentage of gross sales 
our accrual for distribution related fees was million at december  our accrual for distribution related fees at december  was not material 
clinical trial expenses clinical trial costs are a significant component of research and development expenses and include costs associated with third party contractors 
we outsource a substantial portion of our clinical trial activities  utilizing external entities such as cros  independent clinical investigators  and other third party service providers to assist us with the execution of our clinical studies 
for each clinical trial that we conduct  certain clinical trial costs are expensed immediately  while others are expensed over time based on the expected total number of patients in the trial  the rate at which patients enter the trial  and the period over which clinical investigators or cros are expected to provide services 
clinical activities which relate principally to clinical sites and other administrative functions to manage our clinical trials are performed primarily by cros 
cros typically perform most of the start up activities for our trials  including document preparation  site identification  screening and preparation  pre study visits  training  and program management 
on a budgeted basis  these start up costs are typically to of the total contract value 
on an actual basis  this percentage range can be significantly wider  as many of our contracts with cros are either expanded or reduced in scope compared to the original budget  while start up costs for the particular trial may not change materially 
these start up costs usually occur within a few months after the contract has been executed and are event driven in nature 
the remaining activities and related costs  such as patient monitoring and administration  generally occur ratably throughout the life of the individual contract or study 
in the event of early termination of a clinical trial  we accrue and recognize expenses in an amount based on our estimate of the remaining non cancelable obligations associated with the winding down of the clinical trial and or penalties 
for clinical study sites  where payments are made periodically on a per patient basis to the institutions performing the clinical study  we accrue expense on an estimated cost per patient basis  based on subject enrollment and activity in each quarter 
the amount of clinical study expense recognized in a quarter may vary from period to period based on the duration and progress of the study  the activities to be performed by the sites each quarter  the required level of patient enrollment  the rate at which patients actually enroll in and drop out of the clinical study  and the number of sites involved in the study 
clinical trials that bear the greatest risk of change in estimates are typically those that have a significant number of sites  require a large number of patients  have complex patient screening requirements  and span multiple years 
during the course of a trial  we adjust our rate of clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates 
our estimates and assumptions for clinical expense recognition could differ significantly from our actual results  which could cause material increases or decreases in research and development expenses in future periods when the actual results become known 
no material adjustments to our past clinical trial accrual estimates were made during the years ended december    or stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation expense for grants of stock option awards and restricted stock under our long term incentive plans to employees and non employee members of our board of directors based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
the grant date fair value of an award is generally recognized as compensation expense over the award s requisite service period 
we use the black scholes model to compute the estimated fair value of stock option awards 
using this model  fair value is calculated based on assumptions with respect to i expected volatility of our common stock price  ii the periods of time over which employees and members of our board of directors are expected to hold their options prior to exercise expected lives  iii expected dividend yield on our common stock  and iv risk free interest rates  which are based on quoted us treasury rates for securities with maturities approximating the options expected lives 
expected volatility has been estimated based on actual movements in our stock price over the most recent historical periods equivalent to the options expected lives 
expected lives are principally based on our historical exercise experience with previously issued employee and board of directors option grants 
the expected dividend yield is zero as we have never paid dividends and do not currently anticipate paying any in the foreseeable future 
stock based compensation expense also includes an estimate  which is made at the time of grant  of the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited 
this estimate is revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the assumptions used in computing the fair value of option awards reflect our best estimates but involve uncertainties related to market and other conditions  many of which are outside of our control 
changes in any of these assumptions may materially affect the fair value of stock options granted and the amount of stock based compensation recognized in future periods 
in addition  we have granted performance based stock option awards which vest based upon the optionee satisfying certain performance and service conditions as defined in the agreements 
potential compensation cost  measured on the grant date  related to these performance options will be recognized only if  and when  we estimate that these options will vest  which is based on whether we consider the options performance conditions to be probable of attainment 
our estimates of the number of performance based options that will vest will be revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods 
changes in these estimates may materially affect the amount of stock based compensation that we recognize in future periods related to performance based options 
marketable securities we have invested our excess cash primarily in direct obligations of the us government and its agencies  other debt securities guaranteed by the us government  and money market funds that invest in us government securities 
we consider our marketable securities to be available for sale  as defined by authoritative guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb 
these assets are carried at fair value and the unrealized gains and losses are included in other accumulated comprehensive income loss as a separate component of stockholders equity 
if the decline in the value of a marketable security in our investment portfolio is deemed to be other than temporary  we write down the security to its current fair value and recognize a loss that may be charged against income 
we review our portfolio of marketable securities  using both quantitative and qualitative factors  to determine if declines in fair value below cost are other than temporary 
such factors include the length of time and the extent to which market value has been less than cost  financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  recommendations of investment advisors  and forecasts of economic  market  or industry trends 
with respect to debt securities  this review process also includes an evaluation of our intent to sell an individual debt security or our need to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery or maturity 
with respect to equity securities  this review process includes an evaluation of our ability and intent to hold the securities until their full value can be recovered 
this review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment 
we recorded no charges for other than temporary impairment of our marketable securities during  and inconsequential charges for other than temporary impairment of our marketable securities during and depreciation of property  plant  and equipment property  plant  and equipment are stated at cost  net of accumulated depreciation 
depreciation is provided on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
in some situations  the life of the asset may be extended or shortened if circumstances arise that would lead us to believe that the estimated life of the asset has changed 
the life of leasehold improvements may change based on the extension of lease contracts with our landlords 
changes in the estimated lives of assets will result in an increase or decrease in the amount of depreciation recognized in future periods 
results of operations years ended december  and net loss we reported a net loss of million  or per share basic and diluted  for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million  or per share basic and diluted for the increase in our net loss in was principally due to higher selling  general  and administrative expenses  partly in connection with commercializing eylea for wet amd  and higher research and development expenses

effective in  we and sanofi began equally sharing pre launch commercialization expenses related to zaltrap in accordance with the companies collaboration agreement 
our share of these expenses was million in  which reduced our sanofi collaboration revenue 
in connection with recognition of deferred revenue related to zaltrap  as of december   million of the original million of up front payments was deferred and will be recognized as revenue in future periods 
in  sanofi s reimbursement of our antibody expenses consisted of million under the discovery agreement and million of development costs under the license agreement  compared to million and million  respectively  in the higher reimbursement amount under the discovery agreement in compared to was primarily due to an increase in our antibody discovery activities 
the slightly lower reimbursement of development costs in compared to was primarily due to a decrease in development activities related to regn  which is currently on clinical hold  offset generally by increases in development activities for other antibody candidates 
recognition of deferred revenue related to sanofi s million up front payment and other payments increased in compared to in connection with the november amendment of the discovery agreement  sanofi is funding up to million of agreed upon costs incurred by us to expand our manufacturing capacity at our rensselaer  new york facilities  of which million was received or receivable as of december  revenue related to such funding from sanofi is deferred and recognized as collaboration revenue prospectively over the related performance period in conjunction with the recognition of the original million up front payment 
as of december   million of these up front and other payments was deferred and will be recognized as revenue in future periods 
in august  we entered into a separate velocigene agreement with sanofi 
in and  we recognized million in revenue related to this agreement 
bayer healthcare collaboration revenue the collaboration revenue we earned from bayer healthcare  as detailed below  consisted of cost sharing of regeneron eylea development expenses  substantive performance milestone payments  and recognition of revenue related to a non refundable million up front payment received in october and a million milestone payment received in august which  for the purpose of revenue recognition  was not considered substantive 
years ended bayer healthcare collaboration revenue december  in millions cost sharing of regeneron eylea development expenses substantive performance milestone payments recognition of deferred revenue related to up front and other milestone payments total bayer healthcare collaboration revenue cost sharing of our global eylea development expenses with bayer healthcare decreased in compared to due primarily to lower clinical development costs in connection with our phase view trial in wet amd and our phase trial in dme 
in the fourth quarter of  we earned two million substantive milestone payments from bayer healthcare for achieving positive week results in the view study and positive month results in the copernicus study 
recognition of deferred revenue related to the up front and august milestone payments from bayer healthcare decreased in from due to an extension of the estimated performance period over which this deferred revenue is being recognized  effective in the fourth quarter of as of december   million of these up front and milestone payments was deferred and will be recognized as revenue in future periods 
net product sales product sales consist of us sales of our two marketed products  eylea and arcalyst 
we record product sales net of allowances and accruals for prompt pay discounts  rebates and chargebacks under governmental programs including medicaid  product returns  and distribution related fees 
we expect our customers to stock limited supplies of our products due to i contractual limitations that we and our customers establish  ii our products specialty nature  sales price  and distribution channels  and iii our historical experience to date 
in november  we received marketing approval from the fda for eylea for the treatment of wet amd  at which time product sales commenced

bayer healthcare provides us with estimated eylea development expenses for the most recent fiscal quarter 
bayer healthcare s estimate is reconciled to its actual expenses for such quarter in the subsequent fiscal quarter and our portion of its global eylea development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse is adjusted accordingly 
payroll and benefits increased principally due to increases in employee headcount and non cash compensation expense for the reasons described above 
clinical trial expenses decreased due primarily to lower costs related to our phase clinical development program for arcalyst for the prevention of gout flares in patients initiated uric acid lowering therapy  our view trial for eylea in wet amd  our phase trial for eylea in dme  and our clinical development program for regn  which is currently on clinical hold  partly offset by higher costs related to our phase vista dme study for eylea 
clinical manufacturing costs increased primarily due to higher costs related to manufacturing supplies of eylea  zaltrap  and antibody candidates  partly offset by lower costs related to manufacturing clinical supplies of arcalyst 
research and other development costs increased primarily due to higher costs associated with our antibody programs and regulatory submissions for marketing approvals for eylea in wet amd and crvo  and arcalyst for the prevention of gout flares in patients initiated uric acid lowering therapy 
occupancy and other operating costs increased principally in connection with our higher headcount  expanded research and development activities  and new and expanded leased facilities in tarrytown  new york 
cost sharing of bayer healthcare s eylea development expenses decreased primarily due to lower costs related to bayer healthcare s view trial in wet amd  partly offset by higher costs in connection with bayer healthcare s phase vivid dme trial 
we prepare estimates of research and development costs for projects in clinical development  which include direct costs and allocations of certain costs such as indirect labor  non cash compensation expense  and manufacturing and other costs related to activities that benefit multiple projects  and  under our collaboration with bayer healthcare  the portion of bayer healthcare s eylea development expenses that we are obligated to reimburse 
our estimates of research and development costs for clinical development programs are shown below project costs year ended december  increase in millions decrease arcalyst eylea zaltrap sarilumab regn other antibody candidates in clinical development other research programs unallocated costs total research and development expenses drug development and approval in the united states is a multi step process regulated by the fda 
the process begins with discovery and preclinical evaluation  leading up to the submission of an ind to the fda which  if successful  allows the opportunity for study in humans  or clinical study  of the potential new drug 
clinical development typically involves three phases of study phases   and the most significant costs in clinical development are in phase clinical trials  as they tend to be the longest and largest studies in the drug development process 
following successful completion of phase clinical trials for a biological product  a bla must be submitted to  and accepted by  the fda  and the fda must approve the bla prior to commercialization of the drug 
it is not uncommon for the fda to request additional data following its review of a bla  which can significantly increase the drug development timeline and expenses 
we may elect either on our own  or at the request of the fda  to conduct further studies that are referred to as phase b and studies 
phase b studies are initiated and either completed or substantially completed while the bla is under fda review 
these studies are conducted under an ind 
phase studies  also referred to as post marketing studies  are studies that are initiated and conducted after the fda has approved a product for marketing 
in addition  as discovery research  preclinical development  and clinical programs progress  opportunities to expand development of drug candidates into new disease indications can emerge 
we may elect to add such new disease indications to our development efforts with the approval of our collaborator for joint development programs  thereby extending the period in which we will be developing a product 
for example  we  and our collaborators where applicable  continue to explore further development of arcalyst  zaltrap  and eylea in different disease indications 
there are numerous uncertainties associated with drug development  including uncertainties related to safety and efficacy data from each phase of drug development  uncertainties related to the enrollment and performance of clinical trials  changes in regulatory requirements  changes in the competitive landscape affecting a product candidate  and other risks and uncertainties described in item a  risk factors under risks related to the development and approval of our product candidates and new indications for our marketed products  risks related to commercialization of products  and regulatory and litigation risks 
the lengthy process of seeking fda approvals  and subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations  require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our business 
for these reasons and due to the variability in the costs necessary to develop a pharmaceutical product and the uncertainties related to future indications to be studied  the estimated cost and scope of the projects  and our ultimate ability to obtain governmental approval for commercialization  accurate and meaningful estimates of the total cost to bring our product candidates to market are not available 
similarly  we are currently unable to reasonably estimate if our product candidates in clinical development will generate material product revenues and net cash inflows 
selling  general  and administrative expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in due primarily to increases in compensation expense and recruitment costs  principally in connection with higher headcount in  higher commercialization costs primarily in connection with eylea for wet amd  an increase in non cash compensation expense for the reasons described above  and higher legal expenses in connection with patent related litigation with genentech 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold increased to million in from million in  due primarily to our launch of eylea for the treatment of wet amd in november cost of goods sold in and primarily consisted of royalties and the costs of producing eylea and arcalyst commercial supplies

in july  we earned a million substantive performance milestone payment from bayer healthcare in connection with the dosing of the first patient in the copernicus study 
net product sales in and  we recognized as revenue million and million  respectively  of arcalyst net product sales 
we had limited historical returns experience for arcalyst beginning with initial sales in through the end of  therefore  arcalyst net product sales were deferred until the right of return no longer existed and rebates could be reasonably estimated 
effective in the first quarter of  we determined that we had accumulated sufficient historical data to reasonably estimate both product returns and rebates of arcalyst 
as a result  million of previously deferred arcalyst net product sales were recognized as revenue in the first quarter of the effect of recognizing the previously deferred arcalyst net product sales revenue was to lower our net loss per share by in at december   there was no deferred revenue related to arcalyst net product sales

we classify our investments using a three tier fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value 
the three tiers are level  defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets  level  defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable  and level  defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists  therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions 
our methods for valuing our marketable securities are described in note to our financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
we held one level marketable security  which had no fair value at december  and this level security was valued using information provided by our investment advisors and other sources  including quoted bid prices which took into consideration the securities lack of liquidity 
during the year ended december   we recorded charges for other than temporary impairment of this level marketable security totaling million  therefore  as of december   the fair value of this security had been written down to zero

sanofi has agreed to be responsible for providing commercial scale manufacturing capacity for zaltrap 
under the collaboration agreement  as amended  agreed upon worldwide zaltrap development expenses incurred by both companies during the term of the agreement  including costs associated with the manufacture of clinical drug supply  will be funded by sanofi 
if the collaboration becomes profitable  we will be obligated to reimburse sanofi for of these development expenses in accordance with a formula based on the amount of development expenses and our share of the collaboration profits and japan royalties  or at a faster rate at our option 
since inception of the collaboration agreement through december   we and sanofi have incurred million in agreed upon development expenses related to zaltrap 
if the collaboration becomes profitable  we will also be obligated to reimburse sanofi for of the million payment received in connection with the january amendment to our collaboration agreement

as described above under item business clinical programs  based upon the positive findings in the phase velour study  sanofi has submitted a regulatory application for marketing approval of zaltrap for the treatment of previously treated mcrc patients to the ema in the fourth quarter of and the fda in february in addition  the phase venice study for the first line treatment for hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer in combination with docetaxel prednisone is ongoing 
sanofi funded million  million  and million  respectively  of our zaltrap development costs in   and in addition  in  we and sanofi began equally sharing zaltrap pre launch commercialization expenses under the collaboration agreement  as a result  we funded million of sanofi s zaltrap pre launch commercialization expenses in at december   there was a net payable of million to sanofi in connection with the companies zaltrap collaboration  and at december  and  amounts receivable from sanofi in connection with the zaltrap collaboration were million and million  respectively 
in addition  the up front payments from sanofi of million in september and million in january were recorded to deferred revenue and are being recognized as contract research and development revenue over the period during which we expect to perform services 
in   and  we recognized million per year of revenue  respectively  related to these up front payments 
sanofi has the right to terminate the agreement without cause with at least twelve months advance notice 
upon termination of the agreement for any reason  any remaining obligation to reimburse sanofi for of zaltrap development expenses will terminate and we will retain all rights to zaltrap 
antibodies in november  we and sanofi entered into a global  strategic collaboration to discover  develop  and commercialize fully human monoclonal antibodies 
the collaboration is governed by a discovery and preclinical development agreement and a license and collaboration agreement 
in connection with the execution of the discovery agreement in  we received a non refundable up front payment of million from sanofi 
pursuant to the collaboration  sanofi is funding our research to identify and validate potential drug discovery targets and develop fully human monoclonal antibodies against these targets 
in november  we and sanofi amended these collaboration agreements to expand and extend our antibody collaboration 
under the amended discovery agreement  sanofi agreed to fund up to million per year of our antibody discovery activities in through  subject to a one time option for sanofi to adjust the maximum reimbursement amount down to million per year commencing in if over the prior two years certain specified criteria were not satisfied 
in  as we scaled up our capacity to conduct antibody discovery activities  sanofi funded million of our preclinical research under the amended discovery agreement 
the balance between that amount and million  or million  has been added to the funding otherwise available to us in under the amended discovery agreement 
the amended discovery agreement will expire on december   however  sanofi has an option to extend the agreement for up to an additional three years for further antibody development and preclinical activities 
for each drug candidate identified through discovery research under the discovery agreement  sanofi has the option to license rights to the candidate under the license agreement 
if it elects to do so  sanofi will co develop the drug candidate with us through product approval 
under certain defined circumstances  upon exercising its option to license rights to particular candidates  sanofi must make a million substantive milestone payment to us 
under the license agreement  agreed upon worldwide development expenses incurred by both companies during the term of the agreement are funded by sanofi  except that following receipt of the first positive phase trial results for a co developed drug candidate  subsequent phase trial related costs for that drug candidate called shared phase trial costs are shared by sanofi and by us 
if the collaboration becomes profitable  we will be obligated to reimburse sanofi for of development expenses that were fully funded by sanofi or half of million as of december  and of shared phase trial costs  in accordance with a defined formula based on the amounts of these expenses and our share of the collaboration profits from commercialization of collaboration products 
however  we are not required to apply more than of our share of the profits from collaboration products in any calendar quarter towards reimbursing sanofi for these development costs 
if sanofi does not exercise its option to license rights to a particular drug candidate under the license agreement  we retain the exclusive right to develop and commercialize such drug candidate  and sanofi will receive a royalty on sales  if any 
sanofi will lead commercialization activities for products developed under the license agreement  subject to our right to co promote such products 
the parties will equally share profits and losses from sales within the united states 
the parties will share profits outside the united states on a sliding scale based on sales starting at sanofi us and ending at sanofi us  and losses outside the united states at sanofi us

the davis smyth patents are the subject of patent litigation between us and genentech now pending in the united states district court  southern district of new york 
patent litigation is continuing with respect to matters not covered by the genentech agreement see item legal proceedings

these facilities include approximately  square feet of newly constructed space in two new buildings buildings a and b that were completed during the third quarter of and approximately  square feet of additional new space in a third new building building c  that was completed in early the lease will expire in june and contains three renewal options to extend the term of the lease by five years each  as well as early termination options on approximately  square feet of space 
the lease provides for monthly payments over its term and additional charges for utilities  taxes  and operating expenses 
in connection with the lease  we have issued a million letter of credit to our landlord  which is fully collateralized by cash and marketable securities 
certain premises under the lease are accounted for as operating leases 
however  for buildings a  b  and c that we are leasing  we are deemed  in substance  to be the owner of the landlord s buildings in accordance with the application of fasb authoritative guidance 
as a result  we capitalized the landlord s costs of constructing these new facilities and recognized a corresponding facility lease obligation 
we also recognized  as additional facility lease obligation  reimbursements from our landlord for tenant improvement costs that we incurred since  under fasb authoritative guidance  such payments that we receive from our landlord are deemed to be a financing obligation 
monthly lease payments on these facilities are allocated between the land element of the lease which is accounted for as an operating lease and the facility lease obligation  based on the estimated relative fair values of the land and buildings 
as of december   we had capitalized the landlord s costs of constructing buildings a and b  which totaled million  and of constructing building c  which totaled million 
reimbursements from our landlord for buildings a and b tenant improvement costs totaled million and were received by us during and reimbursements for building c tenant improvement costs totaled million and were received by us during with respect to buildings a and b  monthly lease payments commenced in august  the buildings were placed in service by us in september  and the imputed interest rate applicable to our facility lease obligation is approximately

we expect to be reimbursed for a small portion of these capital expenditures for our rensselaer facilities by sanofi  with the remaining amount to be funded by our existing capital resources 
offering of convertible senior notes in october  we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes in a private placement 
the notes were offered by the initial purchaser only to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to rule a under the securities act of the notes will pay interest semi annually on april and october  beginning april   and will mature on october   unless earlier converted or repurchased 
the notes will be convertible  subject to certain conditions  into cash  shares of our common stock  or a combination of cash and shares of common stock  at our option 
the initial conversion rate for the notes will be shares of common stock subject to adjustment in certain circumstances per  principal amount of the notes  which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately per share 
a holder of the notes may surrender their notes at their option any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding july   only under the following circumstances i during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on december  and only during such calendar quarter  if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least trading days whether or not consecutive during a period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to of the conversion price on each applicable trading day  ii during the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period the measurement period in which the trading price  as defined  of the notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day  iii if we elect to issue to all or substantially all holders of our common stock any rights  options  or warrants other than pursuant to a rights plan entitling them for a period of not more than calendar days after the record date for such issuance  to subscribe for or purchase shares of our common stock  at a price per share less than the average of the last reported sales prices of our common stock for the ten consecutive day period ending on  and including  the trading day immediately preceding the declaration date for such issuance  iv upon specified distributions to our shareholders  or v upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions  such as a fundamental change ie  a change in control  or our common stock ceasing to be listed on at least one us national securities exchange

in connection with the offering of the convertible senior notes  we entered into convertible note hedge call option and warrant transactions with multiple counterparties  including an affiliate of the initial purchaser 
the convertible note hedge transactions cover  subject to customary anti dilution adjustments  the number of shares of our common stock that initially underlie the notes  and are intended to reduce the potential dilutive impact of the conversion feature of the notes 
the convertible note hedge will terminate upon the earlier of the maturity date of the notes or the first day the notes are no longer outstanding 
the warrant transactions have an initial strike price of approximately per share  and may be settled in cash or shares of our common stock  at our option 
the warrants expire at various dates during the net proceeds from the convertible senior notes offering were million after deducting the initial purchaser s discount and issuance costs 
in addition  the net cost of the convertible note hedge transactions  after taking into account the proceeds received by us from the warrant transactions  was million 
we intend to use the remaining net proceeds from the issuance of the notes for general corporate purposes 
funding requirements we expect to continue to incur substantial funding requirements for our research and development activities including preclinical and clinical testing 
as described above  research and development expenses that we incur in connection with our zaltrap and antibodies collaborations are generally funded by sanofi 
in addition  as described above  we and bayer healthcare share agreed upon development expenses that both companies incur in connection with our eylea collaboration 
after taking into account anticipated reimbursements from our collaborators  we currently estimate that approximately of our funding requirements for will be directed toward technology development  basic research and early preclinical activities  and the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates 
for  we also currently estimate that approximately of our funding requirements will be directed toward the planned commercialization of new indications for our marketed products and zaltrap  approximately of our funding requirements will be applied to capital expenditures as described above  and the remainder of our funding requirements will be used for general corporate purposes 
in connection with our funding requirements  the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  these obligations and commitments assume non termination of agreements and represent expected payments based on current operating forecasts  which are subject to change payments due by period less than greater than in millions total one year to years to years years convertible senior notes operating leases capital leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total contractual obligations consists of million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes that mature on october   unless earlier converted or repurchased 
the amounts in the table above assume the payment of interest on our convertible senior notes through their maturity date and the payment of the principal amount of the notes at their maturity date 
interest on the notes is payable semi annually 
the convertible senior notes will be convertible  subject to certain conditions  into cash  shares of our common stock  or a combination of cash and shares of common stock  at our option 
excludes future contingent costs for utilities  real estate taxes  and operating expenses 
in  these costs were million 
see note a to our financial statements 
purchase obligations primarily relate to i research and development commitments  including those related to clinical trials  ii capital expenditures for equipment acquisitions  and iii license payments 
our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may increase or be reduced based on certain future events 
open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the table above 
represents payments with respect to facility lease obligations in connection with our lease of facilities in tarrytown  new york  as described above 
see note a to our financial statements 
under our collaboration with bayer healthcare  over the next several years we and bayer healthcare will share agreed upon eylea development expenses incurred by both companies  under a global development plan  as described above 
in addition  under our collaboration agreements with sanofi and bayer healthcare  if the applicable collaboration becomes profitable  we have contingent contractual obligations to reimburse sanofi and bayer healthcare for a defined percentage generally of agreed upon development expenses incurred by sanofi and bayer healthcare  respectively 
profitability under each collaboration will be measured by calculating net sales less agreed upon expenses 
these reimbursements would be deducted from our share of the collaboration profits and  for our zaltrap collaboration with sanofi  royalties on product sales in japan otherwise payable to us  unless  in some cases  we elect to reimburse these expenses at a faster rate 
given the uncertainties related to drug development including the development of zaltrap and co developed antibody candidates in collaboration with sanofi and eylea in collaboration with bayer healthcare  such as the variability in the length of time necessary to develop a product candidate and the ultimate ability to obtain governmental approval for commercialization  we are currently unable to reliably estimate if our collaborations with sanofi and bayer healthcare will become profitable 
the amount we need to fund operations will depend on various factors  including revenues from net product sales  the potential regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates and new indications for our marketed products  and the timing thereof  the status of competitive products  the success of our research and development programs  the potential future need to expand our professional and support staff and facilities  the status of patents and other intellectual property rights and pending or future litigation related thereto  the delay or failure of a clinical trial of any of our potential drug candidates  and the continuation  extent  and success of our collaborations with sanofi and bayer healthcare 
clinical trial costs are dependent  among other things  on the size and duration of trials  fees charged for services provided by clinical trial investigators and other third parties  the costs for manufacturing the product candidate for use in the trials  and for supplies  laboratory tests  and other expenses 
the amount of funding that will be required for our clinical programs depends upon the results of our research and preclinical programs and early stage clinical trials  regulatory requirements  the duration and results of clinical trials underway and of additional clinical trials that we decide to initiate  and the various factors that affect the cost of each trial as described above 
our commercialization costs over approximately the next few years will depend on  among other things  whether or not new indications for our marketed products or our late stage product candidates receive regulatory approval  the market potential for such new indications or product candidates  and the commercialization terms of our collaboration agreements  if applicable whereby some or all commercialization costs may be shared with our collaborators 
currently  we are required to pay royalties on product sales of eylea for the treatment of wet amd and arcalyst for the treatment of caps 
in the future  if we are able to successfully develop  market  and sell eylea or arcalyst for other indications  or certain of our product candidates  we may be required to pay royalties or share the profits from such sales pursuant to our license or collaboration agreements 
we expect that expenses related to the filing  prosecution  defense  and enforcement of patents and other intellectual property will continue to be substantial 
we believe that our existing capital resources  together with funds generated by anticipated eylea net product sales and funding we are entitled to receive under our collaboration agreements  will enable us to meet our projected operating needs 
however  this is a forward looking statement based on our current operating plan  and there may be a change in projected revenues or expenses that would lead to our capital being consumed significantly before such time 
for example  in connection with preparing to commercialize and launch potential products that are not licensed to a third party  we could incur substantial pre marketing and commercialization expenses that could lead us to consume our cash at a faster rate 
if there is insufficient capital to fund all of our planned operations and activities  we anticipate that we would i seek sources of additional capital through collaborative arrangements and or additional public or private financing  including debt and equity financing and or ii prioritize available capital to fund selected preclinical and clinical development programs and or preparations for the potential commercialization of our late stage product candidates  or license selected products 
other than letters of credits totaling million  including the million letter of credit issued in connection with our lease for facilities in tarrytown  new york  as described above  we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
in addition  we do not guarantee the obligations of any other entity 
as of december   we had no other established banking arrangements through which we could obtain short term financing or a line of credit 
in october  we completed a private placement of convertible senior notes  as described above 
in addition  in october  we filed a shelf registration statement on form s registering the sale  in one or more offerings  of an indeterminate amount of equity or debt securities  together or separately  and our october public offering of approximately million shares of common stock was completed under this shelf registration statement 
there is no assurance  however  that we will be able to complete any additional offerings of securities 
factors influencing the availability of additional financing include our progress in product development and commercialization  investor perception of our prospects  and the general condition of the financial markets 
we may not be able to secure additional funding through new collaborative arrangements or additional public or private offerings 
if we cannot raise adequate funds to satisfy our capital requirements  we may have to delay  scale back  or eliminate certain of our research and development activities or future operations 
this could materially harm our business 
future impact of recently issued accounting standards fees paid to the federal government by pharmaceutical manufacturers in december  the fasb provided authoritative guidance on how pharmaceutical manufacturers should recognize and classify in their income statement annual fees mandated by the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act 
this guidance became effective for calendar years beginning after december  the adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our financial statements for the year ended december   and we do not anticipate that this guidance will have a material impact on our financial statements for the year ended december   since i arcalyst for the treatment of caps  has been approved as an orphan drug and orphan drugs are not subject to this annual fee and ii eylea received regulatory approval from the fda  and was launched  in november presentation of comprehensive income in june  the fasb amended its authoritative guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income 
under the amendment  an entity will have the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
this amendment  therefore  eliminates the currently available option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the amendment does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income 
we will adopt this amended guidance for the fiscal year beginning january  as this guidance relates to presentation only  the adoption of this guidance will not have any other effect on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates  principally in connection with our investments in marketable securities  which consist primarily of direct obligations of the us government and its agencies  other debt securities guaranteed by the us government  and money market funds that invest in us government securities 
we do not believe we are materially exposed to changes in interest rates 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we estimate that a one percent unfavorable change in interest rates would have resulted in approximately a million and million decrease in the fair value of our unrestricted investment portfolio at december  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest rate risk year over year is due primarily to lower balances of marketable debt securities with maturities in excess of one year that we held at december  compared to credit quality risk we have an investment policy that includes guidelines on acceptable investment securities  minimum credit quality  maturity parameters  and concentration and diversification 
nonetheless  deterioration of the credit quality of an investment security subsequent to purchase may subject us to the risk of not being able to recover the full principal value of the security 
we have recognized other than temporary impairment charges related to certain marketable securities of million in and during  we did not recognize any other than temporary impairment charges 
we are also subject to credit risk in connection with accounts receivable from our product sales of eylea and arcalyst 
our marketed products are sold in the united states  and related accounts receivable are due from three distributors and several specialty pharmacies  who are our customers 
we have contractual payment terms with each of our customers 
we monitor our customers financial performance and credit worthiness so that we can properly assess and respond to any changes in their credit profile 
during   and we did not recognize any charges for write offs of accounts receivable related to our marketed products
