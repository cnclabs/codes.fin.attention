item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in this section  references to the company  we  us and our with respect to the period before consummation of the initial public offering of campus crest communities  inc on october   refer to the business of campus crest communities  inc s predecessor entities through which campus crest group  llc carried out the development  construction  ownership and management of the properties that campus crest communities  inc acquired upon completion of the offering and the formation transactions 
overview our company we are a self managed  self administered and vertically integrated developer  builder  owner and manager of high quality  purpose built student housing 
we were formed as a maryland corporation on march  and the operating partnership  of which we  through our wholly owned subsidiary  campus crest communities gp  llc  are the sole general partner  was formed as a delaware limited partnership on march  as of december   we owned a limited partnership interest in the operating partnership 
as of december   we owned interests in operating student housing properties containing approximately  apartment units and  beds 
all of our properties are recently built  with an average age of approximately years as of december  twenty seven of our properties  containing approximately  apartment units and  beds  are wholly owned and four of our properties  containing approximately apartment units and  beds  are owned through a joint venture with hsre  in which we own a interest 
additionally  we completed construction of two joint venture properties  in august  in which we own a interest and contain units and  beds 
all of our communities contain modern apartment units with many resort style amenities 
we derive substantially all of our revenue from student housing rental  student housing services  construction and development services and management services 
as of december   the average occupancy for our operating properties was approximately and the average monthly total revenue per occupied bed was approximately our properties are primarily located in medium sized college and university markets  which we define as markets located outside of major us cities that have nearby schools generally with overall enrollment of approximately  to  students 
we believe such markets are underserved and are generally experiencing enrollment growth 
we intend to pay regular quarterly distributions to our common stockholders in amounts that meet or exceed the requirements for our qualification as a reit 
although we currently anticipate making distributions to our common stockholders in cash to the extent cash is available for such purpose  we may  in the sole discretion of our board of directors  make a distribution of capital or of assets or a taxable distribution of our stock as part of a distribution in which stockholders may elect to receive stock or  subject to a limit measured as a percentage of the total distribution  cash 
for the year ended december   we declared dividends totaling per share and paid dividends totaling per share 
the difference between the declared amount and the paid amount is due to the timing between the date the dividend is declared and the date the dividend is paid 
our business segments management evaluates operating performance through the analysis of results of operations of two distinct business segments i student housing operations and ii development  construction and management services 
management evaluates each segment s performance by net operating income  which we define as operating income before depreciation and amortization 
the accounting policies of our reportable business segments are described in more detail in the summary of significant accounting policies footnote note to our consolidated and combined financial statements 
intercompany fees are reflected at the contractually stipulated amounts  as adjusted to reflect our proportionate ownership of unconsolidated entities 

table of contents student housing operations our student housing operations are comprised of rental and other service revenues  such as application fees  pet fees and late payment fees 
we opened our first student housing property in asheville  north carolina in for the academic year 
we subsequently opened three additional properties in for the academic year  six additional properties in for the academic year and nine additional properties in for the academic year 
in  we opened one additional property that was consolidated by our predecessor and four additional properties that were owned by a real estate venture in which we have a noncontrolling interest 
in august  we opened three additional properties for the academic year that were owned by the same real estate venture 
concurrent with the offering in october  we purchased the noncontrolling interest in one of the properties owned by this real estate venture 
in december  we purchased the controlling interest in two properties that were opened in august in august  we opened four wholly owned properties and an additional two properties that are owned in a real estate ventures in which we have a noncontrolling interest 
due to the continuous opening of new properties in consecutive years and annual lease terms that do not coincide with our reported fiscal calendar years  the comparison of our consolidated financial results from period to period may not provide a meaningful measure of our operating performance 
for this reason  we divide the results of operations in our student housing operations segment between new property operations and same store operations  which we believe provides a more meaningful indicator of comparative historical performance 
development  construction and management services development and construction services 
in addition to our wholly owned properties  all of which were developed and built by us  we also provide development and construction services to unconsolidated joint ventures in which we have an ownership interest 
we act as a general contractor on all of our construction projects 
when building properties for our own account ie  for entities that are consolidated in our financial statements  construction revenues and expenses are eliminated for accounting purposes and construction costs are ultimately reflected as capital additions 
thus  building properties for our own account does not generate any revenues or expenses in our development  construction and management services segment on a consolidated basis 
alternatively  when performing these services for unconsolidated joint ventures  we recognize construction revenues based on the costs that have been contractually agreed to with the joint venture for the construction of the property and expenses based on the actual costs incurred 
construction revenues are recognized using the percentage of completion method  as determined by construction costs incurred relative to total estimated construction costs  as adjusted to eliminate our proportionate ownership of each entity 
actual construction costs are expensed as incurred and are likewise adjusted to eliminate our proportionate ownership of each entity 
operating income generated by our development and construction activities generally reflects the development fee and construction fee income that is realized by providing these services to unconsolidated joint ventures ie  the spread between the contractual cost of construction and the actual cost of construction 
management services 
in addition to our wholly owned properties  all of which are managed by us  we also provide management services to unconsolidated joint ventures in which we have an ownership interest 
we recognize management fees from these entities as earned in accordance with the property management agreement with these entities  as adjusted to eliminate our proportionate ownership of each entity

for additional information regarding the revolving credit facility  please refer to liquidity and capital resources principal capital resources below 
income taxation we elect to be treated as a reit under sections through of the internal revenue code 
our continued qualification as a reit depends upon our ability to meet on a continuing basis  through actual investment and operating results  various complex requirements under the internal revenue code relating to  
table of contents among other things  the sources of our gross income  the composition and values of our assets  our distribution levels and the diversity of ownership of our stock 
we believe that our intended manner of operation will enable us to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a reit 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to us federal income tax on taxable income that we distribute currently to our stockholders 
factors expected to affect our operating results unique leasing characteristics student housing properties are typically leased by the bed on an individual lease liability basis  unlike multi family housing where leasing is by the unit 
individual lease liability limits each student tenant s liability to his or her own rent without liability for a roommate s rent 
a parent or guardian is required to execute each lease as a guarantor unless the student tenant provides adequate proof of income 
the number of lease contracts that we administer is therefore equivalent to the number of beds occupied rather than the number of units 
due to our predominantly private bedroom accommodations  the high level of student oriented amenities offered at our properties and the individual lease liability for our student tenants and their parents  we believe that we typically command higher per unit and per square foot rental rates than many multi family properties located in the markets in which we operate 
we are also typically able to charge higher rental rates than on campus student housing  which generally offers fewer amenities 
unlike traditional multi family housing  most of our leases commence on the same date 
in the case of our typical month leases which provide for equal monthly payments  this date coincides with the commencement of the fall academic term and typically terminates at the completion of the last summer school session 
as such  we must re lease each property in its entirety each year  resulting in significant turnover in our tenant population from year to year 
as a result  we are highly dependent upon the effectiveness of our marketing and leasing efforts during the annual leasing season that typically begins in january and ends in august of each year 
our properties occupancy rates are therefore typically relatively stable during the august to july academic year  but are susceptible to fluctuation at the commencement of each new academic year  which may be greater than the fluctuation in occupancy rates experienced by traditional multi family properties 
for most of our properties  the primary leasing season concludes by the end of august our properties located in ellensburg  washington and cheney  washington are exceptions  where the primary leasing season typically extends into september  as the academic year for the primary university served by each of these properties typically starts in late september 
development  construction and management services the amount and timing of revenues from development  construction and management services will typically be contingent upon the number and size of development projects that we are able to successfully structure and finance in our current and future unconsolidated joint ventures 
in particular  we entered into a joint venture with hsre  hsre v  in which we have a interest and that is currently building two student housing properties with completion targeted for the academic year and is currently repositioning and expanding a third property 
we will receive fees for providing development and construction services to hsre v 
similarly  we will receive management fees for managing properties owned by hsre v once they are placed in service 
no assurance can be given that hsre v will be successful in developing student housing properties as currently contemplated or those currently under construction 

table of contents results of operations we have set forth a discussion comparing the consolidated results for year ended december  to the combined operating results of our operations for the period from october  through december   and the predecessor s historical results of operations for the period from january  through october  additionally  we have set forth a discussion comparing the combined operating results of the company and the predecessor for the year ended december  to the predecessor s historical results of operations for the year ended december  the historical results of operations presented below should be reviewed in conjunction with the notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements included elsewhere in this report

table of contents student housing operations revenues which include student housing rental and student housing service revenues in the student housing operations segment increased by approximately million and operating expenses in the student housing operations segment increased by approximately million  in as compared to the increase in revenues was primarily due to the opening of four new properties in august  the inclusion of operating results from the grove at san marcos for a full calendar year in  as well as increases in occupancy and monthly revenue per bed at our other consolidated properties 
the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to the opening of four new properties in august and the inclusion of operating results from the grove at san marcos for a full calendar year in this increase was partially offset by decreases in property level marketing expenses  repairs and maintenance and payroll 
new property operations 
in august  we opened six new properties that were developed by us 
as of december   two of these properties were owned by an unconsolidated joint venture 
four of these properties  the grove at ames  the grove at clarksville  the grove at columbia and the grove at fort wayne  were reflected in our consolidated operating results for the year ended december  these four properties contributed approximately million in revenue and approximately million of operating expenses for the year ended december  compared to no contribution to revenues and operating expenses for the year ended december  the grove at san marcos was acquired those interests that we did not already own on october  and consolidated from that date through december  and for the months ended december  prior to the acquisition of this interest  we accounted for our ownership interest in this property under the equity method 
the grove at san marcos contributed approximately million of revenues and approximately million of operating expenses for the year ended december  as compared to approximately million in revenues and million of operating expense for the period from october  to december  the two unconsolidated properties that opened in are discussed below under the heading equity in loss of unconsolidated entities

development  construction and management services revenues and operating expenses in the development  construction and management services segment decreased by approximately million and approximately million  respectively  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  our development  construction and management services segment recognizes revenues and operating expenses for development  construction and management services provided to unconsolidated joint ventures in which we have an ownership interest 
we eliminate revenue and related expenses on such transactions with our unconsolidated entities to the extent of our ownership interest 
the decrease in development  construction and management services revenues and operating expenses was primarily due to construction activity on two unconsolidated joint venture properties in in which we owned compared to three unconsolidated joint venture properties through october in which we owned 
such decrease was only partially offset by the fourth quarter construction activity for three additional unconsolidated joint venture properties  in which we own a interest 
we continued to generate development  construction and management services revenues and operating expenses in with respect to the two unconsolidated joint venture properties that opened in august our 
table of contents ability to generate revenues and expenses related to future development and construction projects will depend upon our ability to enter into and provide services to new joint ventures  including our new joint venture  hsre v  for which we have begun construction on three properties with completion targeted for the academic year  as well as our proportionate ownership of any such joint ventures 
we commenced building three additional student housing properties for our own account and are included in our consolidated financial statements and will not generate development  construction and management services revenues and operating expenses for us on a consolidated basis

write off of pre development costs write off of pre development costs were in and million in as a result of events that occurred in which led management to conclude that certain pre development projects would not result in either the acquisition of a site or commencement of construction 
as of december   all pre development prospects remain probable 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december  the million increase was primarily due to depreciation and amortization related to the number of operating properties and in service date of wholly owned properties in august as well as consideration of san marcos for the full year in equity in loss of unconsolidated entities equity in loss of unconsolidated entities  which represents our share of the net loss from entities in which we have a noncontrolling interest  increased from a loss of approximately million for the year ended december  to a loss of approximately million for the year ended december  this million increase was primarily due to an increase in our ownership interest to in hsre i upon the completion of the offering in october  the addition of three new properties owned by hsre i that commenced operations in august and had a full year of operations during and two additional properties owned by hsre iv that commenced operations in august these losses are primarily driven by the ventures depreciation expense 
nonoperating income expense interest expense 
interest expense decreased from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december  the million decrease was primarily due to lower outstanding indebtedness during as compared to due to the change in the company s capital structure as a result of the offering and formation transactions in october change in fair value of interest rate derivatives 
change in fair value of interest rate derivatives decreased from a gain of approximately million for the year ended december  to a gain of approximately million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in non cash mark to market adjustments of approximately million  offset by a decrease in monthly net cash settlements of approximately million

table of contents liquidity and capital resources as a reit  we generally must distribute annually at least of our reit taxable income  excluding any net capital gain  in order for corporate income tax not to apply to earnings that we distribute 
to the extent that we satisfy this distribution requirement  but distribute less than of our reit taxable income  we will be subject to us federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income 
in addition  we will be subject to a nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we distribute to our stockholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under us federal income tax laws 
we intend to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the requirements of the internal revenue code and to avoid paying corporate tax on undistributed income 
in addition  we intend to make distributions that exceed these requirements 
we may need to obtain financing to meet our distribution requirements because our income may not be matched by our related expenses at the time the income is considered received for purposes of determining taxable income  and non deductible capital expenditures  creation of reserves or debt service requirements may reduce available cash but not taxable income 
in these circumstances  we may be forced to obtain third party financing on terms we might otherwise find unfavorable  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing 
alternatively  if we are unable or unwilling to obtain third party financing on the available terms  we could choose to pay a portion of our distributions in stock instead of cash  or we may fund distributions through asset sales 
as of december   we have approximately million of total consolidated indebtedness which does not include any indebtedness we may incur in connection with any future distributions or any other unanticipated borrowings under our revolving credit facility  representing debt to total market capitalization ratio of approximately 
we define our debt to total market capitalization ratio as our total outstanding consolidated indebtedness divided by the sum of the market value of our outstanding common stock and preferred stock which may decrease  thereby increasing our debt to total market capitalization ratio  including shares of restricted stock or restricted stock units that we may issue to our officers and directors under our equity incentive compensation plan  plus the aggregate value of op units  plus the book value of our total consolidated indebtedness excluding indebtedness encumbering our current and future joint venture properties 
as of december   our pro rata share of indebtedness encumbering properties held in unconsolidated joint ventures was approximately million 
the company serves as guarantor for the joint ventures outstanding indebtedness 
principal capital resources on october   we closed the credit agreement with citibank  na and certain other parties thereto relating to a three year  million senior secured revolving credit facility 
this facility was secured by of our wholly owned properties 
on august   we amended and restated the credit agreement to increase the amount to million and adjust the interest rate  the result of which decreased the spread over the elected floating interest rate 
additionally  the revolving credit facility  which was formerly secured  became unsecured and now matures on august   subject to a one year extension option we may exercise at our option  pursuant to certain terms and conditions 
on november   we amended the amended and restated credit agreement with citibank  na and certain other lenders 
the amendment increased the maximum amount we may borrow from million to million  with a sublimit of million for swing line loans and million for letters of credit 
unless otherwise terminated pursuant to terms of the amended and restated credit agreement  the revolving credit facility will mature on august   subject to a one year extension option which we may exercise at our option  pursuant to certain terms and conditions  including the payment of an extension fee  contained in the amended and restated credit agreement 

table of contents as of december   approximately million was outstanding under our revolving credit facility and approximately million of borrowing capacity was available under this facility 
the amount available for us to borrow under this credit facility is based on the lesser of i of the as is appraised value of our properties that form the borrowing base of the facility  and ii the amount that would create a debt service coverage ratio of not less than 
additionally  our revolving credit facility has an accordion feature that allows us to request an increase in the total commitments of an additional million to a total commitment of million 
amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility bear interest at a floating rate equal to  at our election  the eurodollar rate or the base rate each as defined in our revolving credit facility plus a spread 
the spread depends upon our leverage ratio and ranges from to for eurodollar rate based borrowings and from to for base rate based borrowings 
our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility is subject to our ongoing compliance with a number of customary financial covenants  including a maximum leverage ratio of  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of  a minimum ratio of fixed rate debt and debt subject to hedge agreements to total debt of  a maximum secured recourse debt ratio of  a minimum tangible net worth of not less than the sum of approximately million plus an amount equal to of the net proceeds of any additional equity issuances  and a maximum secured debt ratio of not greater than through february   and not greater than on any date thereafter 
under our revolving credit facility  our distributions may not exceed the greater of i of our ffo or ii the amount required for us to qualify and maintain our status as a reit 
if a default or event of default occurs and is continuing  we may be precluded from making certain distributions other than those required to allow us to qualify and maintain our status as a reit 
we and certain of our subsidiaries guarantee the obligations under our revolving credit facility and we and certain of our subsidiaries have provided a negative pledge against specified assets including real property  stock and other interests 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants in our revolving credit facility 
on november   we filed a shelf registration statement which was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission on december  and provides for the ability to issue up to million of debt and equity securities

see short term liquidity needs 
short term liquidity needs the nature of our business  coupled with the requirement imposed by reit rules that we distribute a substantial majority of our reit taxable income on an annual basis in order for us to qualify as a reit  will cause us to have substantial liquidity needs 
our short term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay operating expenses associated with our properties  recurring capital expenditures  development costs  interest expense  scheduled debt service payments and expected distribution payments including distributions to persons who hold op units 
we typically expect to meet our short term liquidity needs through cash flow from operations and  to the extent necessary  borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

table of contents on february   we closed an underwritten public offering of  shares of our series a cumulative redeemable preferred stock the series a preferred stock  including  shares issued and sold pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters overallotment option in full 
the shares of series a preferred stock were issued at a public offering price of per share  for net proceeds of approximately million  after deducting the underwriting discount and other estimated offering costs 
we used the net proceeds to repay approximately million of indebtedness outstanding under two construction loans which had been used as partial funding for the four properties that were delivered for the academic year 
we intend to use the remaining proceeds to reduce borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes  including funding properties currently under development 
recurring capital expenditures our properties require periodic investments of capital for general maintenance 
these recurring capital expenditures vary in size annually based upon the nature of the maintenance required for that time period 
for example  recently developed properties typically do not require major maintenance such as the replacement of a roof 
in addition  capital expenditures associated with newly acquired or developed properties are typically capitalized as part of their acquisition price or development budget  so that such properties typically begin to require recurring capital expenditures only following their first year of ownership 
our historical recurring capital expenditures at our consolidated properties are set forth below total beds as of january total recurring capital expenditures average per bed total number of beds is as of january of the year indicated  excluding beds at consolidated properties that commenced operations during the year indicated  as they did not require material recurring capital expenditures 
in  we had properties with  beds and an average age of approximately years  excluding properties which commenced operation in that year that required maintenance capital expenditures 
such expenditures included furniture replacement 
in  we had properties with  beds and an average age of approximately years  excluding properties which commenced operation in the current year and required maintenance capital expenditures 
such expenditures included furniture and appliance replacement 
in  we have properties with  beds and an average age of approximately years  excluding properties which commenced operations in the current year and required maintenance capital expenditures 
such expenditures included furniture replacement 
the differential in per bed recurring maintenance capital expenditures from through is a function of the uneven nature of the timing of such expenditures 
additionally  we are contractually required to fund reserves for capital repairs at certain mortgaged properties 
in particular  our indebtedness relating to our asheville property requires us to fund a monthly reserve of  for capital repairs  our indebtedness relating to our carrollton  las cruces and milledgeville properties requires us to fund a monthly reserve of  per property for capital repairs  our indebtedness relating to our ellensburg and greely properties requires us to fund a monthly reserve of  per property for capital repairs and our indebtedness relating to our nacogdoches property requires us to fund a monthly reserve of  for capital repairs 
those reserves are funded through operating cash flows 
development expenditures our development activities have historically required us to fund pre development expenditures such as architectural fees  engineering fees and earnest deposits 
because the closing of a development project s 
table of contents financing is often subject to various delays  we cannot always predict accurately the liquidity needs of these activities 
we frequently incur these pre development expenditures before a financing commitment has been obtained and  accordingly  bear the risk of the loss of these pre development expenditures if financing cannot ultimately be arranged on acceptable terms 
we are building six new student housing properties  three of which are wholly owned by us and three of which are owned by hsre v  a joint venture that we established with hsre  and in which we own a interest 
we are currently targeting completion of these six properties for the academic year 
for each of these projects  we commenced construction subsequent to conducting significant pre development activities 
we estimate that the cost to complete all three wholly owned properties will be approximately million 
additionally  we will be obligated to fund our pro rata portion of the development costs of our joint venture with hsre  and we estimate that the cost to complete the three joint venture properties will be approximately million and our net pro rata share of equity will be approximately million 
no assurance can be given that we will complete construction of these six properties in accordance with our current expectations including the estimated cost thereof 
during  we closed on all financing necessary for our six development projects  including million of construction financings for our wholly owned projects in auburn  al and orono  me  million for the remaining wholly owned development in flagstaff  az  as well as million of construction loans for our three joint venture projects with hsre 
we intend to finance our share of the remaining construction costs through the revolving credit facility 
long term liquidity needs our long term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for long term development activities  non recurring capital expenditures  potential acquisitions of properties and payments of debt at maturity 
long term liquidity needs may also include the payment of unexpected contingencies  such as remediation of unknown environmental conditions at our properties or at additional properties that we develop or acquire  or renovations necessary to comply with the ada or other regulatory requirements 
we do not expect that we will have sufficient funds on hand to cover all of our long term liquidity needs 
we will therefore seek to satisfy these needs through cash flow from operations  additional long term secured and unsecured debt  including borrowings under our revolving credit facility  the issuance of debt securities  the issuance of equity securities and equity related securities including op units  property dispositions and joint venture transactions 
we believe that we will have access to these sources of capital to fund our long term liquidity requirements  but we cannot make any assurance that this will be the case  especially in difficult market conditions

funds from operations ffo ffo is used by industry analysts and investors as a supplemental operating performance measure for reits 
we calculate ffo in accordance with the definition that was adopted by the board of governors of nareit 
ffo  as defined by nareit  represents net income loss determined in accordance with gaap  excluding extraordinary items as defined under gaap and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets  plus specified non cash items  such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
in addition  in october  nareit communicated to its members that the exclusion of impairment write downs of depreciable real estate is consistent with the definition of ffo 
we use ffo as a supplemental performance measure because  in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from property dispositions  it provides a performance measure that  when compared year over year  captures trends in occupancy rates  rental rates and operating expenses 
we also believe that  as a widely recognized measure of the performance of equity reits  ffo will be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other reits 
however  because ffo excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties  all of which have real economic effects and could materially and adversely impact our results of operations  the utility of ffo as a measure of our performance is limited 
while ffo is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of equity reits  other equity reits may use different methodologies for calculating ffo and  accordingly  ffo as disclosed by such other reits may not be comparable to ffo published herein 
therefore  we believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our historical operating results  ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income loss as presented in the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss computed in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our properties financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to pay dividends or make distributions 
the following table presents a reconciliation of our ffo to our net income loss for the year ended december   the period from october  through december   the period from january  through october  and the years ended december   and in thousands campus crest communities  inc campus crest communities predecessor year ended december  october  through december  january  through october  year ended december  funds from operations ffo net income loss gain on purchase of joint venture properties real estate related depreciation and amortization real estate related depreciation and amortization unconsolidated joint ventures ffo for  gain is from the purchase of our joint venture partner s interest in the grove at san marcos  for  gain is from the purchase of our joint venture partner s interest in the grove at huntsville and the grove at statesboro 

table of contents in addition to ffo  we believe it is also a meaningful measure of our performance to adjust ffo to exclude the change in fair value of interest rate derivatives and the write off of development costs 
excluding the change in fair value of interest rate derivatives and development cost write offs adjusts ffo to be more reflective of operating results prior to capital replacement or expansion  debt service obligations or other commitments and contingencies

inflation our student housing leases typically do not have terms that extend beyond months 
accordingly  although on a short term basis we would be required to bear the impact of rising costs resulting from inflation  we have the opportunity to raise rental rates at least annually to offset any rising costs 
however  our ability to raise rental rates could be limited by a weak economic environment or declining student enrollment at our principal colleges and universities 
critical accounting policies set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these accounting policies are particularly important for an understanding of the financial position and results of operations presented in the consolidated and combined financial statements set forth elsewhere in this report 
these policies require the application of judgment and assumptions by management and  as a result  are subject to a degree of uncertainty 
actual results could differ as a result of such judgment and assumptions 
our consolidated and combined financial statements include the accounts of all investments  which include joint ventures in which we have a controlling interest  and our consolidated subsidiaries and the combined subsidiaries of the predecessor 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions combined that affect amounts reported in our historical consolidated and combined financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has utilized all available information  including its past history  industry standards and the current economic environment  among other factors  in forming its estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the historical consolidated and combined financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
our estimates may not be ultimately realized 
application of the critical accounting policies below involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results will differ from these estimates 
in addition  other companies in similar businesses may utilize different estimation policies and methodologies  which may impact the comparability of our results of operations and financial condition to those companies 
valuation of investment in real estate investment in real estate is recorded at historical cost 
pre development expenditures include items such as entitlement costs  architectural fees and deposits associated with the pursuit of partially owned and wholly owned development projects 
these costs are capitalized until such time that management believes it is probable 
table of contents that a contract will be executed and or construction will commence 
management evaluates the status of projects where we have not yet acquired the target property or where we have not yet commenced construction on a periodic basis and writes off any pre development costs related to projects whose current status indicates the commencement of construction is not probable 
such write offs are included within operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated and combined statements of operations 
management assesses whether there has been impairment in the value of our investment in real estate whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of investment in real estate is assessed by a comparison of the carrying amount of a student housing property to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the property 
impairment is recognized when estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the property 
the estimation of expected future cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future economics and market conditions 
if such conditions change  then an adjustment reducing the carrying value of our long lived assets could occur in the future period in which conditions change 
to the extent that a property is impaired  the excess of the carrying amount of the property over its estimated fair value is charged to operating earnings 
fair value is determined based upon the discounted cash flows of the property  quoted market prices or independent appraisals  as considered necessary 
investment in unconsolidated entity under the equity method  investments are initially recognized in the balance sheet at cost and are subsequently adjusted to reflect our proportionate share of net earnings or losses of the entity  distributions received  contributions  and certain other adjustments  as appropriate 
any difference between the carrying amount of these investments on our balance sheet and the underlying equity in net assets is amortized as an adjustment to equity in net income loss of unconsolidated entities 
when circumstances indicate there may have been a loss in value of an equity method investment  and we determine the loss in value is other than temporary  we recognize an impairment charge to reflect the investment at fair value 
development  construction and management services development and construction service revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method  as determined by construction costs incurred relative to total estimated construction costs 
any changes in significant judgments and or estimates used in determining construction and development revenue could significantly change the timing or amount of construction and development revenue recognized 
development and construction service revenues are recognized for contracts with entities we do not consolidate 
for projects where the revenue is based on a fixed price  any cost overruns incurred during construction  as compared to the original budget  will reduce the net profit ultimately recognized on those projects 
profit derived from these projects is eliminated to the extent of our interest in the unconsolidated entity 
any incentive fees  net of the impact of our ownership interest if the entity is unconsolidated  are recognized when the project is complete and performance has been agreed upon by all parties  or when performance has been verified by an independent third party 
when total development or construction costs at completion exceed the fixed price set forth within the related contract  such cost overruns are recorded as additional investment in the unconsolidated entity 
entitlement fees  where applicable  are recognized when earned 
allowance for doubtful accounts allowances for student receivables are established when management determines that collections of such receivables are doubtful 
balances are considered past due when payment is not received on the contractual due date 
when management has determined receivables are uncollectible  they are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts 

table of contents fair value of financial instruments the estimated fair value of our revolving line of credit approximates the outstanding balance due to the frequent market based repricing of the underlying variable rate index 
the estimated fair values of mortgages and construction loans are determined by comparing current borrowing rates and risk spreads offered in the market to the stated interest rates and spreads on our current mortgages and construction loans 
fair value guidance for financial assets and liabilities which are recognized and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis and nonfinancial assets on a nonrecurring basis establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level measurements and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs level measurements 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows level observable inputs  such as quoted prices in active markets at the measurement date for identical  unrestricted assets or liabilities 
level other inputs that are observable directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs which are observable  either directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term of the asset or liability 
level unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data and which we make our own assumptions about how market participants would price the asset or liability 
fair value is defined as the price that would be received when selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date exit price 
in instances where inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy  the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety has been determined is based on the lowest level input significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability 
income taxes we elected and qualified to be treated as a reit under sections through of the internal revenue code commencing with our taxable year ended on december  we believe that we continue to be organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a reit under the internal revenue code and that our manner of operation will enable us to maintain qualification and taxation as a reit 
as a reit  we generally are not subject to us federal income tax on taxable income that we distribute currently to our stockholders 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions  we will be subject to us federal income tax at regular corporate rates and generally will be precluded from qualifying as a reit for the subsequent four taxable years following the year during which we lost our reit qualification 
accordingly  our failure to qualify as a reit could materially and adversely affect us  including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders in the future 
even as a reit  we may be subject to some us federal  state and local taxes on our income or property and the income of our trss will be subject to taxation at normal corporate rates 
property acquisitions we allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets based on relative fair values 
fair value estimates are based on information obtained from independent appraisals  other market data  information obtained during due diligence  and information related to the marketing and leasing at the specific property 
the value of in place leases is based on the difference between i the property valued with existing in place leases adjusted to market rental rates and ii the property valued as if vacant 
as lease terms 
table of contents are typically one year or less  rates on in place leases generally approximate market rental rates 
factors considered in the valuation of in place leases include an estimate of the carrying costs during the expected lease up period considering current market conditions  nature of the tenancy  and costs to execute similar leases 
carrying costs include estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up period  net of variable operating expenses 
the value of in place leases is amortized over the remaining initial term of the respective leases  generally less than one year 
the purchase price of property acquisitions is not expected to be allocated to tenant relationships  considering the terms of the leases and the expected levels of renewals 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new guidance on disclosure requirements for fair value measurements 
the guidance requires additional disclosures related to transfers of financial instruments within the fair value hierarchy and quantitative and qualitative disclosures related to significant unobservable inputs 
the standards update is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating what impact  if any  its adoption will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued new accounting guidance which eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity 
entities will have the option to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement or two separate but consecutive statements 
this guidance requires retrospective application and is effective for annual periods  and interim periods contained within those annual periods  beginning after december  we have not yet decided on the format that will be used in future periods 
the standard will not change the recognition or measurement of net income or comprehensive income 
in december  the fasb issued an accounting standards update to defer those changes that relate only to the presentation of reclassification adjustments in the statement of operations 
in december  the fasb issued an accounting standards update requiring new disclosures about financial instruments and derivative instruments that are either offset by  or subject to  an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement 
the standards update is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating what impact  if any  its adoption will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued new accounting guidance which addresses whether the existing guidance on sales of real estate applies to derecognition events involving subsidiaries that are in substance real estate 
the guidance addresses whether or not the loss of a controlling interest in the in substance real estate as a result of a default on the entity s nonrecourse debt  is sufficient to justify derecognition of the entity s assets including the real estate and liabilities including the nonrecourse debt 
the guidance is intended to emphasize that investors should apply the existing guidance on sale of real estate to determine whether to derecognize the in substance real estate and that accounting for such transactions be based on substance over form 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning on or after june  we believe that the adoption of this guidance on january  will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements

our ultimate exposure to interest rate fluctuations depends on the amount of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates  the time at which the interest rate is adjusted  the amount of adjustment  the ability to prepay or refinance variable rate indebtedness and hedging strategies used to reduce the impact of any increases in rates 
as of december   the estimated fair value of our construction loans and fixed rate mortgage debt was million 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
we seek to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower the overall borrowing costs by closely monitoring our variable rate debt and converting such debt to fixed rates when we deem such conversion advantageous 
as of december   approximately million of our aggregate indebtedness of total indebtedness was subject to variable interest rates 
if market rates of interest on our variable rate long term debt fluctuate by  interest cost would increase or decrease  depending on rate movement  future earnings and cash flows by approximately million annually 
this assumes that the amount outstanding under our variable rate debt remains at million  the balance as of december  we do and may in the future  continue to use derivative financial instruments to manage  or hedge  interest rate risks related to such variable rate borrowings 
we do not  and do not expect to  use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes  and we expect to enter into contracts only with major financial institutions
