table of contents the sheepskin used in certain ugg products is in high demand and limited supply  and there have been significant increases in the prices of sheepskin as the demand from competitors for this material has increased 
the markets for casual  outdoor  and athletic footwear have grown significantly during the last decade 
we believe this growth is a result of the trend toward casual dress in the workplace  increasingly active outdoor lifestyles  and a growing emphasis on comfort 
consumers are more often seeking footwear designed to address a broader array of activities with the same quality  comfort  and high performance attributes they have come to expect from traditional athletic footwear 
our consumers have narrowed their footwear product breadth  focusing on brands with a rich heritage and authenticity as market category creators and leaders 
consumers have become increasingly focused on luxury and comfort  seeking out products and brands that are fashionable while still comfortable 
there is an emerging sustainable lifestyle movement happening all around the world 
consumers are demanding that brands and companies become more environmentally responsible 
by emphasizing our brands images and our focus on comfort  performance and authenticity  we believe we can continue to maintain a loyal consumer following that is less susceptible to fluctuations caused by changing fashions and changes in consumer preferences 
we have also responded to consumer focus on sustainability by establishing objectives  policies  and procedures to help us drive key sustainability initiatives around human rights  environmental sustainability  and community affairs 
we have experienced costs increases  most significantly with sheepskin 
we attempt to cover the full amount of our sheepskin purchases under fixed price contracts 
we continually strive to contain our material costs through increasing the mix of non sheepskin products  exploring new footwear materials and new production technologies  and utilizing lower cost production  including the us where we will begin sourcing product from in also  refer to item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for further discussion of our commodity price risk 
below is an overview of the various components of our business  including some key factors that affect each business and some of our strategies for growing each business 
ugg brand overview the ugg brand has become well known throughout the us as well as internationally 
over the past several years  our ugg brand has received increased global media exposure including increased print media in ads and cooperative advertising with our customers  which has contributed to broader public awareness of the brand and significantly increased demand for the collection 
we believe that the increased global media focus and demand for ugg products were driven by the following consumer brand loyalty  due to the luxury and comfort of ugg footwear  continued innovation of new product categories and styles  including those beyond footwear  increased marketing in high end magazines  out of home and digital advertising for women and men  a targeted ugg for men campaign featuring tom brady  targeted marketing at prospective consumers in new catalogs and direct mail pieces  successful targeting of higher end distribution  expanded product assortment purchases from existing accounts  
table of contents adoption by high profile celebrities as a favored footwear brand  increased media attention that has enabled us to introduce the brand to consumers much faster than we would have otherwise been able to  increased exposure to the brand driven by our concept stores that showcase all of our product offerings  continued expansion of worldwide retail through new ugg australia stores  continued geographic expansion across the us and internationally  and expansion of our shop in shop program worldwide 
we believe the luxury and comfort features of ugg products will continue to drive long term consumer demand 
recognizing that there is a significant fashion element to ugg footwear and that footwear fashions fluctuate  our strategy seeks to prolong the longevity of the brand by offering a broader product line suitable for wear in a variety of climates and occasions and by limiting distribution to selected higher end retailers 
as part of this strategy we have increased our product offering  including a growing spring line  an expanded men s line  and a fall line that consists of a range of luxurious collections for both genders  an expanded kids line  as well as handbags  cold weather accessories  and apparel 
we have also recently expanded our marketing and promotional efforts  which we believe has and will continue to contribute to our growth 
we believe that the evolution of the ugg brand and our strategy of product diversification also will help decrease our reliance on sheepskin  which is in high demand and subject to price volatility 
nonetheless  we cannot assure investors that our efforts will continue to provide ugg brand growth 
teva brand overview our teva brand is positioned to be a leading innovative  global  action outdoor brand  with over years worth of contributions to the outdoor adventure experience 
the teva brand pioneered the water sport sandal category in  and to this day  our brand mission is to inspire spontaneity  camaraderie  and adventure on  around  or in water 
leveraging our core performance competencies of traction  hydro  and comfort footwear  we are focused on driving growth through innovation in the emerging action outdoor space through multi sport  light hiking  freestyle mountain bike riding  action water sports  and other action outdoor lifestyle products 
our efforts to expand the teva brand beyond sandals  while embracing our core water based competencies  contributed to significant revenue growth in and throughout the past few years  our broader range of footwear demonstrated strong retail sell through across all channels  and we believe that our retail partners have viewed both our product and marketing innovations as relevant and compelling 
we see an opportunity to grow the teva brand significantly outside of the us 
in january  we converted from a distributor model to a wholesale model in the benelux region and france  enhancing our marketing and distribution capabilities in the outdoor active benelux market 
in january  we converted our teva brand international business from an independent distributor to a wholesale model in the uk  including scotland and ireland  which now affords us the opportunity to better drive our brand building and growth initiatives in this influential market 
in  our teva brand will be re launched in the japanese market by our japan subsidiary 
within the us  we see strong growth opportunities within our current core channels of distribution  outdoor specialty  and sporting goods  as our product assortment evolves and expands 
also  through effective product and distribution segmentation  we see significant expansion opportunities within the family value  department store  better footwear  and action sports channels 
however  we cannot assure investors that these efforts will be successful

the brand has a history of innovation  product invention  foot friendly comfort  and clever branding 
sanuk is currently available in more than  retailers in countries and at sanuk 
com 
we believe that the sanuk brand is an ideal addition to the deckers family of brands and that each of our brands can leverage off each others distribution channels 
the sanuk business is a profitable  well run business that we believe provides for substantial growth opportunities within the action sports market  as well as other markets and channels in which deckers is already established 
in the years since its inception  the sanuk brand has consistently brought creativity  fun  and comfort to the line of sandals and shoes for men  women  and children

the mozo brand strives to deliver revolutionary footwear for creative  passionate  and talented professionals that spend long hours working on their feet 
our high performance footwear is designed to the standards of these professionals  not just their workplace 
in  mozo introduced the chef signature collection footwear designed by marcus samuelsson  aaron sanchez  and chris cosentino 
this collection has put the mozo brand in the press for the first time and allowed the brand to open up new distribution opportunities 
we have recently expanded our distribution to include large on line retailers and into the health care worker market

managing our ecommerce business requires us to focus on the latest trends and techniques for web design and marketing  to generate internet traffic to our websites  to effectively convert website visits into orders  and to maximize average order sizes 
we plan to continue to grow our ecommerce business through improved website features and performance  increased marketing  expansion into international markets  and utilization of mobile and tablet technology

in june  our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to  of our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  subject to market conditions  applicable legal requirements and other factors 
the program did not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program could be suspended at any time at our discretion 
as of june   we had repurchased the full amount authorized under this program 
during the year 
table of contents ended december   we repurchased approximately  shares for approximately  or an average price of per share 
on february   our board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program to repurchase up to  of our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  subject to market conditions  applicable legal requirements  and other factors 
the program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion 
the purchases will be funded from available working capital 
on august   we entered into a credit agreement the credit agreement with jpmorgan chase bank  national association as the administrative agent  comerica bank and hsbc bank usa  national association  as syndication agents  and the lenders party thereto 
the credit agreement is a five year   secured revolving credit facility which contains a  sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit and a  sublimit for swingline loans and replaces the previous credit agreement 
subject to customary conditions and the approval of any lender whose commitment would be increased  we have the option to increase the maximum principal amount available under the credit agreement by up to an additional  resulting in a maximum available principal amount of  none of the lenders under the credit agreement has committed at this time or is obligated to provide any such increase in the commitments 
at our option  revolving loans issued under the credit agreement will bear interest at either adjusted libor for days at december  plus per annum  in the case of libor borrowings  or at the alternate base rate plus per annum  and thereafter the interest rate will fluctuate between adjusted libor plus per annum and adjusted libor plus per annum or between the alternate base rate plus per annum and the alternate base rate plus per annum  based upon our total adjusted leverage ratio at such time 
in addition  we will initially be required to pay fees of per annum on the daily unused amount of the revolving credit facility  and thereafter the fee rate will fluctuate between and per annum  based upon our total adjusted leverage ratio 
at december   we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement and outstanding letters of credit of as a result   was available under the credit agreement at december  our obligations under the credit agreement are guaranteed by our existing and future domestic subsidiaries other than certain immaterial subsidiaries and foreign subsidiaries the guarantors  and is secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets and the guarantors  including all or a portion of the equity interests of certain of our domestic and foreign subsidiaries 
the credit agreement contains financial covenants which include our asset coverage ratio must be greater than to  and the sum of the consolidated annual earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda and annual rental expense  divided by the sum of the annual interest expense and the annual rental expense must be greater than to  and other customary limitations 
the credit agreement contains certain other covenants which include a maximum additional secured debt related to a capital asset not to exceed  maximum additional unsecured debt not to exceed  maximum secured debt not related to a capital asset not to exceed  maximum judgment of  maximum erisa event of  in one year   in all years  we may not have a change of control  there is no limit on acquisitions  if the total adjusted leverage ratio does not exceed to and we must have a minimum amount of cash plus unused credit of  and there is no restriction on dividends or share repurchases  if the minimum amount of cash plus unused credit is  as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants and remain so as of the date of this report 

table of contents contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effects such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase obligations unrecognized tax benefits total our operating lease obligations consist primarily of building leases for our retail locations  distribution centers  and corporate and regional offices 
the majority of other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets  with the exception of our sanuk contingent consideration liability discussed below  are related to deferred rents  of which the cash lease payments are included in operating lease obligations in this table 
our purchase obligations consist mostly of open purchase orders 
they also include promotional expenses and service contracts 
outstanding purchase orders are primarily with our third party manufacturers and are expected to be paid within one year 
these are outstanding open orders and not minimum purchase obligations 
our promotional expenditures and service contracts are due periodically through we also entered into minimum purchase commitments see note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we have included the total remaining cash commitments  net of deposits  as of december  in this table 
we expect our sheepskin purchases by third party factories supplying ugg product to us will eventually exceed the minimum commitment levels  therefore we believe the deposits will become fully refundable  and thus  we believe this will not materially affect our results of operations  as it is in the normal course of our business 
the unrecognized tax benefits are related to uncertain tax positions taken in our income tax return that would impact the effective tax rate or additional paid in capital  if recognized 
see note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the purchase price for the sanuk brand also includes contingent consideration over the next five years as follows ebitda of the sanuk brand multiplied by ten  less the closing payment  up to maximum of  which we expect to pay  in march  of the gross profit of the sanuk brand in  defined as total sales less the cost of sales for the business of the sellers  of gross profit of the sanuk brand in  and of the product of gross profit of the sanuk brand in multiplied by five 
there is no maximum to the contingent consideration payments for   and these payments were excluded from the table above as all conditions for the payments have not been met 
contingent consideration payments of  are included within other accrued expenses and long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  we are currently involved in various legal claims arising from the ordinary course of business 
management does not believe that the disposition of these matters will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in addition  we have agreed to indemnify certain licensees  distributors and promotional partners in connection with claims related to the use of our intellectual 
table of contents property 
the terms of such agreements range up to five years initially and generally do not provide for a limitation on the maximum potential future payments 
management believes the likelihood of any payments is remote and would be immaterial 
we determined the risk was low based on a prior history of insignificant claims 
we are not currently involved in any indemnification matters in regards to our intellectual property 
we believe that internally generated funds  the available borrowings under our existing credit agreement  and our cash and cash equivalents will provide sufficient liquidity to enable us to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  risks and uncertainties that could impact our ability to maintain our cash position include our growth rate  the continued strength of our brands  our ability to respond to changes in consumer preferences  our ability to collect our receivables in a timely manner  our ability to effectively manage our inventories  our ability to generate returns on our acquisitions of businesses  and market volatility  among others 
see part i  item a  risk factors for a discussion of additional factors that may affect our working capital position 
furthermore  we may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other future developments  including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue 
if these sources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements  we may seek to sell debt securities or additional equity securities or to obtain a new credit agreement or draw on our existing credit agreement 
the sale of convertible debt securities or additional equity securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
the incurrence of indebtedness would result in incurring debt service obligations and could result in operating and financial covenants that would restrict our operations 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
although there are no other material present understandings  commitments or agreements with respect to the acquisition of any other businesses  we may evaluate acquisitions of other businesses or brands 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  presentation of comprehensive income  an amendment to asc  comprehensive income  that brings us generally accepted accounting principles gaap into alignment with international financial reporting standards for the presentation of other comprehensive income oci 
effective for us beginning january   the option in current gaap that permits the presentation of oci in the statement of changes in equity has been eliminated 
the provisions of the update provide that an entity that reports items of oci has two options a single statement must present the components of net income  total net income  the components of oci  total oci  and total comprehensive income  or a two statement approach whereby an entity must present the components of net income and total net income in the first statement 
that statement must be immediately followed by a financial statement that presents the components of oci  a total for oci  and a total for comprehensive income 
beginning january   we will adopt this asu using the single statement approach 
the adoption of this asu will only change the presentation of oci on our consolidated financial statements 
impact of inflation we believe that the rates of inflation in the three most recent fiscal years have not had a significant impact on our net sales or profitability 
critical accounting policies and estimates refer to note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our significant accounting policies 
those policies and estimates that we believe are most critical to the understanding of our consolidated financial statements contained in this report are revenue recognition  use of estimates  which includes the below reserves and allowances  inventories  accounting for long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets  fair value of contingent consideration  and stock compensation 

table of contents use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts during the reporting period 
management reasonably could use different estimates and assumptions  and changes in estimates and assumptions could occur from period to period  with the result in each case being a potential material change in the financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations 
we have historically been materially accurate in our estimates used for the reserves and allowances below 
the following table summarizes data related to the critical accounting estimates for accounts receivable allowances and reserves  which are discussed below december  december  amount of gross trade accounts receivable amount of gross trade accounts receivable gross trade accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts reserve for sales discounts allowance for estimated chargebacks amount of net sales amount of net sales net sales for the three months ended allowance for estimated returns estimated returns liability allowance for doubtful accounts 
we provide a reserve against trade accounts receivable for estimated losses that may result from customers inability to pay 
we determine the amount of the reserve by analyzing known uncollectible accounts  aged trade accounts receivables  economic conditions and forecasts  historical experience and the customers credit worthiness 
trade accounts receivable that are subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged or written off against this reserve 
the reserve includes specific reserves for accounts  which all or a portion of are identified as potentially uncollectible  plus a non specific reserve for the balance of accounts based on our historical loss experience 
reserves have been established for all projected losses of this nature 
our use of different estimates and assumptions could produce different financial results 
for example  a change in the rate used to estimate the reserve for the accounts we consider to have credit risk and are not specifically identified as uncollectible would change the allowance for doubtful accounts at december  by approximately  reserve for sales discounts 
a significant portion of our domestic net sales  as well as our international wholesale sales  and resulting trade accounts receivable reflects a discount that our customers may take  generally based upon meeting certain order  shipment and payment timelines 
we use the amount of the discounts that are available to be taken against the period end trade accounts receivable to estimate and record a corresponding reserve for sales discounts 
the decrease in the reserve was primarily due to one of our largest customers receiving discounted pricing on invoices rather than receiving payment terms discounts  which lowered the overall reserve 
allowance for estimated chargebacks 
when our wholesale customers pay their invoices  they often take deductions for chargebacks against their invoices  which are often valid 
therefore  we record an allowance for the balance of chargebacks that are outstanding in our accounts receivable balance as of the end of each period  along with an estimated reserve for chargebacks that have not yet been taken against outstanding accounts receivable balances 
this estimate is based on historical trends of the timing and amount of chargebacks taken against invoices 

table of contents allowance for estimated returns and estimated returns liability 
we record an allowance for anticipated future returns of goods shipped prior to period end and a liability for anticipated returns of goods sold direct to consumers 
in general  we accept returns for damaged or defective products 
we also have a policy whereby we accept returns from our retail and ecommerce customers for a thirty day period 
we base the amounts of the allowance and liability on any approved customer requests for returns  historical returns experience  and any recent events that could result in a change from historical returns rates  among other factors 
the allowance for estimated returns increased as a percentage of net sales due to higher levels of actual returns received subsequent to year end 
our use of different estimates and assumptions could produce different financial results 
for example  a change in the rate used to estimate the percentage of sales expected to ultimately be returned would change the allowance and liability reserves for returns in total at december  by approximately  inventory write downs 
we review the various items in inventory on a regular basis for excess  obsolete  and impaired inventory 
in doing so  we write the inventory down to the lower of cost or expected future net selling prices 
at december   inventories were stated at  net of inventory write downs of  at december   inventories were stated at  net of inventory write downs of  the increase in inventory write downs was primarily due to additional write downs primarily in our other brand segment related to simple brand inventories 
our use of different estimates and assumptions could produce different financial results 
for example  a change in the estimated selling prices of our potentially obsolete inventory would change the inventory write down reserve at december  by approximately valuation of goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of goodwill  intangible  and other long lived assets on a separate asset basis based on assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying amount of these assets individually 
we performed our annual impairment tests for goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets 
we evaluated our ugg and sanuk goodwill and our teva trademarks 
based on the carrying amounts of the ugg  teva  and sanuk goodwill  trademarks  and net assets  the brands sales and operating results  and the brands long term forecasts of sales and operating results as of their evaluation dates  we concluded that the carrying amounts of the ugg and sanuk goodwill  as well as the teva trademarks  were not impaired 
our teva trademarks were evaluated using the relief from royalty method 
our use of different estimates including estimated royalty rates  discount rates  and future revenues  among others and assumptions could produce different financial results 
as of october   our teva trademarks had a carrying value of  at that date  our estimate of the trademarks fair value was substantially in excess of the carrying value 
however  if growth rates fail to meet our forecasts  impairment of the teva trademark may occur in the future 
our goodwill balance at december  represents goodwill in the sanuk and ugg reporting units 
we believe the ugg reporting unit s fair value is substantially in excess of its carrying value 
we believe the sanuk reporting unit s fair value is greater than its carrying value  as we have increased our sanuk sales and profitability forecasts since the acquisition 
all goodwill was evaluated based on qualitative analyses  and the teva trademarks were evaluated based on level inputs 
for  we performed our annual impairment tests of goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets using income approaches and valuation techniques and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill or intangible assets as of october or december  on our teva trademarks or other nonamortizable intangible assets and goodwill  respectively 
we also evaluated amortizable long lived assets  including intangible assets as of december  and we recorded immaterial impairment losses in sg a in our other brands segment for which the fair values did not exceed their carrying values 
we recorded certain amortizable intangible assets related to our sanuk acquisition see note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for the valuation methodologies used 
our other valuation methodologies used as of december  did not change from the prior year 

table of contents fair value of contingent consideration 
we have entered into contingent consideration arrangements when we acquired brands 
the fair value of our sanuk brand contingent consideration is material and highly subjective 
it is based on estimated future sales and gross profits  and discount rates  among other variables and estimates  and certain years have no maximum payment see note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
these are evaluated each reporting period and the contingent consideration is adjusted accordingly 
our estimated revenue forecasts include a compound annual growth rate of through our use of different estimates and assumptions could produce different financial results 
for example  a change in the estimated compound annual growth rate would change the total liability balance at december  by approximately  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our market risk exposure with respect to financial instruments is tied to changes in the prime rate in the us and changes in libor 
our credit agreement provides for interest on outstanding borrowings at rates tied to the prime rate or  at our election  tied to libor 
at december   we did not have any outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement 
a increase in interest rates on our current borrowings would have no impact on income before income taxes 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we face market risk to the extent that changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect our foreign assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we hedge certain foreign currency forecasted transactions and exposures from existing assets and liabilities 
other than an increasing amount of sales  expenses  and financial positions denominated in foreign currencies  as discussed above  we do not believe that there has been a material change in the nature of our primary market risk exposures  including the categories of market risk to which we are exposed and the particular markets that present the primary risk of loss 
as of the date of this annual report on form k  we do not know of or expect there to be any material change in the general nature of our primary market risk exposure in the near term 
we currently utilize forward contracts and other derivative instruments to mitigate exposure to fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rate  for a portion of the amounts we expect to purchase and sell in foreign currencies 
as our international operations grow and we increase purchases and sales in foreign currencies  we will evaluate and may utilize additional derivative instruments  as needed  to hedge our foreign currency exposures 
we do not use foreign currency contracts for trading purposes 
although the majority of our sales and inventory purchases are denominated in us currency  these sales and inventory purchases may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rates between the us dollar and the local currencies in the international markets where our products are sold and manufactured 
our foreign currency exposure is generated primarily from our asian and european operations 
approximately  or  of our total net sales for the year ended december  were denominated in foreign currencies 
as we begin to hold more cash and other monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies  we are exposed to financial statement translation gains and losses as a result of translating the operating results and financial positions held in foreign currencies into us dollars 
we translate monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies into us dollars using the exchange rate as of the end of the reporting period 
in addition  certain of our foreign subsidiaries local currency is their designated functional currency 
accordingly  we translate those assets and liabilities into us dollars using the exchange rates at of the end of the reporting period  which results in financial statement translation gains and losses in oci 
changes in foreign exchange rates affect our reported profits and can distort comparisons from year to year 
in addition  if the us dollar strengthens  it may result in increased pricing pressure on our foreign distributors  and retailers  which may have a negative impact on our net sales and gross margins 
as of december   our hedging contracts had notional amounts totaling approximately  based upon sensitivity analysis as of december   a change in foreign exchange rates would cause the fair value of our financial instruments to increase or decrease by approximately  
table of contents commodity price risk 
we purchase certain materials that are affected by commodity prices  the most significant of which is sheepskin 
the supply of sheepskin used in certain ugg products is in high demand and there are a limited number of suppliers able to meet our expectations for the quantity and quality of sheepskin required 
there have been significant increases in the price of sheepskin in recent years as the demand from our competitors for this commodity has increased 
we experienced a increase in sheepskin costs in compared to  and we expect an additional increase in for this commodity 
other significant factors affecting the price of sheepskin include weather patterns  harvesting decisions  global economic conditions  and other factors which are not considered predictable or within our control 
we use purchasing contracts  pricing arrangements  and refundable deposits to attempt to reduce the impact of price volatility as an alternative to hedging commodity prices 
the purchasing contracts and pricing arrangements we use may result in unconditional purchase obligations  which are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
in the event of significant commodity cost increases  we will likely not be able to adjust our selling prices sufficiently to mitigate the impact on our margins
