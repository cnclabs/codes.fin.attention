table of contents business overview analogic is a high technology company that designs and manufactures advanced medical imaging and security systems and subsystems sold to original equipment manufacturers  or oems  and end users primarily in the healthcare and airport security markets 
we were incorporated in the commonwealth of massachusetts in november and are recognized worldwide for advancing state of the art technology in the areas of medical computed tomography  or ct  ultrasound  magnetic resonance imaging  or mri  digital mammography  and ct based automated explosive detection systems for airport security 
our oem customers incorporate our technology into systems they in turn sell for various medical and security applications 
we also sell our ultrasound products directly into clinical end user markets through our direct worldwide sales force under the brand name b k medical 
our business is strategically aligned into three business segments medical imaging  ultrasound  and security technology 
at the end of fiscal year  we combined our oem ultrasound transducer business  which was previously reported in the medical imaging segment  and our b k medical direct ultrasound systems business in the ultrasound segment  under one management team 
the combined business is now reported as the ultrasound segment consistent with how our principal executive officer began monitoring the business in the first quarter of fiscal year all periods presented have been revised accordingly to reflect the new reporting segments 
a significant portion of our products are sold to oems  whose purchasing dynamics have an impact on our reported sales 
oems that purchase our medical imaging products generally incorporate those products as components in their systems  which are in turn sold to end users  who are primarily hospitals and medical clinics 
in our security technology segment  our oem customers purchase and resell our products to end users including domestic and foreign airports as well as the tsa in the us those customers purchasing dynamics are affected by the level of government funding  the expansion of airport terminals and fluctuations in airline passenger volume 
fiscal year overview the following table sets forth the percentage of total net revenue by reporting segment for fiscal years and all periods presented have been revised accordingly to reflect our new reporting segments 
fiscal year medical imaging ultrasound security technology total the following is a summary of the metrics from our consolidated statement of operations that our management believes are most important in understanding our results of operations for the periods indicated 
this summary is not a substitute for the detail provided in the following pages or for the audited consolidated financial statements and notes that appear elsewhere in this document 
fiscal year percentage change total net revenue gross profit gross margin income from operations operating margin income from continuing operations diluted net income per share from continuing operations 
table of contents during fiscal year our total net revenue increased by as compared to the prior year due primarily to growth in revenue in our security and ultrasound segments of and  respectively 
gross margin remained relatively consistent in fiscal year versus the prior year due to gross margin increases in our ultrasound and security technology segments partially offset by a gross margin decline in our medical imaging segment 
income from operations increased in fiscal year from the prior year comparable period due primarily to increased gross profit from an increase in sales volumes and headcount reductions made in fiscal year also contributing to the increase was a reduction in internally funded research and product development expenses and restructuring charges partially offset by an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses 
during fiscal year  we received a refund of  as the result of the completion of an irs audit of us federal income tax returns for the fiscal years ended july    and the refund was largely the result of us federal research and experimentation credits that carryover from the fiscal years ended july  through into the audited returns 
we recorded a tax benefit for this refund  including the related interest  in the audited consolidated statement of operations of  in fiscal year the tax benefit from the refund and interest were partially offset by related contingent professional fees of  recorded in general and administrative expenses within income from operations in the audited consolidated statement of operations in fiscal year in connection with the conclusion of the irs audit  we also recorded a reversal and re measurement of related tax reserves of  in the audited consolidated statement of operations in fiscal year in addition to the positive impact from the growth in income from operations and the tax benefit of  income from continuing operations and diluted net income per share from continuing operations in fiscal year were favorably impacted by a gain of  on the sale of our remaining ownership interest in a china based affiliate 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we sold our hotel business  and realized net proceeds of  after transaction costs 
we recorded a gain on sale of the hotel business of  net of a tax provision of  or per diluted share in fiscal year the hotel business is being reported as a discontinued operation 
revenues and net income loss for the hotel business for fiscal years and were as follows year ended july  total net revenue net income loss we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of  and  at july  and  respectively 
as of july  our investment portfolio primarily consisted of demand deposits at highly rated banks and financial institutions 
the following table sets forth an overview of our cash flows for fiscal years and see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual 
table of contents report on form k for information regarding certain items in our fiscal year audited consolidated statement of cash flows being reclassified to conform to the current period presentation 
year ended july  net cash provided by continuing operations for operating activities net cash used by continuing operations for investing activities net cash used for financing activities net cash used by discontinued operations effect of exchange rate changes on cash net increase in cash and cash equivalents during fiscal year  we generated  of cash provided by continuing operations for operating activities as compared to  in the prior year 
the increase was due primarily to an increase in sales volume and improved operating efficiency in fiscal year as compared to the prior year comparable period as well as an income tax refund and related interest received in fiscal year of  net cash used by continuing operations for investing activities in fiscal year was due primarily to capital spending of  which includes the construction of a manufacturing facility in shanghai  china  and the purchase of a new facility in state college  pennsylvania 
prior year cash used by continuing operations for investing activities was due primarily to capital spending of  which included the construction of the shanghai  china manufacturing facility 
this was partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of our hotel business of  after transaction costs

results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year net revenue product revenue product revenue for fiscal year as compared with fiscal year is summarized in the table below 
year ended july  percentage change product revenue medical imaging ultrasound security technology total medical imaging the increase for fiscal year versus the prior year primarily reflects growth in our mri and digital mammography product lines driven by higher sales volume of existing products 
this increase was offset by fewer shipments in our ct product line due primarily to customer ordering patterns and lower sales of our motion control products  reflecting a decline in the semiconductor market and the sale of a subsidiary of our motion control business in the fourth quarter of fiscal year ultrasound the increase for fiscal year versus the prior year was due primarily to increased sales of our flex focus platform of products in the us through our expanded sales force and internationally through both our 
table of contents direct sales force and our distributor network 
also contributing to the increase was the acquisition of an oem ultrasound transducer business in the second quarter of fiscal year security technology the increase for fiscal year versus the prior year was due primarily to increased sales of baggage scanners  driven by demand for our new high speed and small footprint systems as well as growth in demand for our medium speed systems

commitments  contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements our contractual obligations at july   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flows in future periods are as follows contractual obligation total less than year years more than years years more than years operating leases purchasing obligations pension contingent consideration 
table of contents as of july   the total liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions were  due to the complexity associated with our tax uncertainties  we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle the non current liabilities associated with these uncertain tax positions 
therefore  these amounts have not been included in the contractual obligations table 
on october   we entered into a million five year  revolving credit agreement  which we refer to as the credit agreement  with the financial institutions identified therein as lenders  which included sovereign bank  td bank  na  and hsbc bank usa  national association 
the credit agreement is guaranteed by our material domestic subsidiaries as designated by us from time to time or as required under the credit agreement  and is supported by a pledge of of the capital stock and equity equivalents of our principal international subsidiary 
the credit facility does not require amortization of principal and may be reduced or repaid before maturity in whole or in part at our option without penalty 
the credit agreement replaces a  credit facility with sovereign bank that had been renewed annually since and was terminated in connection with the new facility 
borrowings under the credit agreement may be used for general corporate purposes  including permitted acquisitions 
the amount of the facility can be increased under specified circumstances up to  in aggregate 
we are the sole borrower under the credit agreement 
interest rates on borrowings under the credit facility range from to above the libor rate  or  if we do not elect the libor rate  from to above the defined base rate which is the highest of the prime rate  the federal funds rate plus  or one month libor plus  in each case based upon our leverage ratio 
a quarterly commitment fee ranging from to per annum is applicable on the undrawn portion of the credit facility  based upon our leverage ratio 
the credit agreement limits our and our subsidiaries ability to  among other things incur additional indebtedness  incur liens or guarantee obligations  pay dividends or make other distributions  make investments  dispose of assets  and engage in transactions with affiliates except on an arms length basis 
in addition  the credit agreement requires us to maintain the following financial ratios a leverage ratio  defined as consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated trailing four quarters ebitda of no greater than at any time  and an interest coverage ratio  defined as the ratio of consolidated trailing four quarters ebitda to consolidated interest charges of no less than at any time 
at july   our leverage ratio was and our interest coverage ratio was infinite as we had no attributable interest expense  and we were in full compliance with all financial and operating covenants 
any failure to comply with the financial or operating covenants of the credit facility would prevent us from being able to borrow and would also constitute a default  permitting the lenders to  among other things  accelerate repayment of outstanding borrowings  including all accrued interest and fees  and to terminate the credit facility 
a change in control of analogic corporation  as defined in the credit agreement  would also constitute an event of default  permitting the lenders to accelerate repayment and terminate the credit agreement 
in connection with the entering into this facility  we incurred approximately of transactions costs  which are being expensed over the five year life of the credit facility 
we currently also have approximately  in other revolving credit facilities with banks available for direct borrowings 
we did not have any borrowing outstanding under credit facilities at july  and 
table of contents impact of investigation regarding our danish subsidiary as previously disclosed in our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended july   we have identified transactions involving our danish subsidiary  b k medical  and certain of its foreign distributors  with respect to which we have raised questions concerning compliance with law  including danish law and the united states foreign corrupt practices act  and our business policies 
we have voluntarily disclosed this matter to the danish government  the doj and the sec  and are cooperating with an inquiry by the doj and the sec 
we are unable to estimate the potential penalties and or sanctions  if any  that might be assessed in connection with this matter 
we have concluded that the identified transactions have been properly accounted for in our reported financial statements in all material respects 
we have terminated the employment of b k medical employees that were involved in the transactions 
we have wound down  or are in the process of winding down  our relationship with the b k medical distributors that were involved in the transactions 
replacing these employees and distributors could have an adverse impact on b k medical s distributor sales until their replacements are in place and productive 
revenue from sales to the b k medical distributors with whom we have decided to wind down b k medical s relationship  represented less than of our total revenue in fiscal year and less than of our total revenue in fiscal year during fiscal year  we incurred employee termination costs of approximately and inquiry related costs of approximately  in connection with this matter 
recent accounting pronouncements recently adopted impairment testing in december  the financing accounting standards board  or fasb  issued guidance modifying step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
for those reporting units  an entity is required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
this guidance was effective for us on august  and did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued an accounting standards update which provides  subject to certain conditions  the option to perform a qualitative  rather than quantitative  assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
this guidance was effective for us on august  and did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
business combinations and noncontrolling interests in december  the fasb issued guidance specifying that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements  the entity acquirer should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination s that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
it also expands the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
this guidance was effective for us prospectively for material business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after august  fair value measurements in may  the fasb issued an update to the accounting on fair value measurement to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between us gaap and international financial reporting standards  or ifrs 
this update changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements 

table of contents this update does not extend the use of fair value accounting  but provides guidance on how it should be applied where its use is already required or permitted by other standards within us gaap or ifrs 
this update is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   and is applied prospectively 
early adoption is prohibited 
this guidance was effective for us on february   and had no impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
not yet effective presentation of comprehensive income in june  the fasb issued an update to the accounting on comprehensive income to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income and to facilitate convergence of us gaap and ifrs 
this update requires that all non owner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
this update does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income 
further  this update does not affect how earnings per share is calculated or presented 
this update is effective for annual periods beginning after december   and annual and interim periods thereafter 
the update is applied retrospectively 
early adoption is permitted 
subsequently  in december  the fasb issued guidance which defers only those changes that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments 
this guidance was effective for us on august   and did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment in july  the fasb issued an update regarding testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
this update gives an entity the option first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
if  after assessing the totality of events and circumstances  an entity concludes that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired  then the entity is not required to take further action 
however  if an entity concludes otherwise  then it is required to determine the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying amount 
an entity also has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test 
an entity will be able to resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 
the guidance is effective for us on august   and it not expected to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
our most critical accounting policies  and the estimates involved in their application  have a significant impact on the preparation of these consolidated financial statements 
these policies involve significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expense  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we continue to evaluate our estimates and judgments on an on going basis 
by their nature  the policies discussed below require management to make its most difficult and subjective estimates and judgments  often on matters that are inherently uncertain 
our estimates and judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers  and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies  see note  summary of business operations and significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in 
table of contents item  exhibits and financial statements schedule  of this annual report on form k 
we believe the following accounting policies require management to make the most difficult estimates and judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and accordingly are critical to an understanding of our financial statements 
revenue recognition policy we provide engineering services to some of our customers on a contractual basis and generally recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method 
we generally estimate the progress towards completion on contracts with a fixed fee arrangement on a monthly basis utilizing costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated costs at completion of the project or on a milestone basis based on contractual terms  as appropriate 
when total cost estimates exceed revenues  we accrue for the estimated losses immediately 
judgments and uncertainties our revenue recognition accounting methodology for engineering services with a fixed fee arrangement involves uncertainties because it requires management to make estimates of our total estimated costs at completion of projects 
the timing of when revenue  profits  and loss reserves are recognized may fluctuate if changes to the estimates of costs at completion of projects are needed 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions when actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions or if our estimates are revised  we recognize a gain or loss in our consolidated statement of operations 
these variances could have a material impact on our consolidated statement of operations and financial position 
allocation of consideration in multiple element revenue arrangements policy we allocate arrangement consideration to each deliverable in an arrangement based on its relative selling price 
we determine selling price using vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  if it exists  and otherwise third party evidence  or tpe 
if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exists for a unit of accounting  we use estimated selling price  or esp 
we generally expect that we will not be able to establish tpe due to the nature of the markets in which we compete  and  as such  we typically will determine selling price using vsoe or if not available  esp 
if we are unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe  and the order was received or materially modified after july   we use esp in the allocation of arrangement consideration 
the objective of esp is to determine the price at which we would transact if the product or service were sold by us on a standalone basis 
judgments and uncertainties our determination of esp involves a weighting of several factors based on the specific facts and circumstances of the arrangement 
specifically  we will consider the cost to produce the deliverable  the anticipated margin on that deliverable  the selling price and profit margin for similar parts  our ongoing pricing strategy and policies as evident in the price list as established and updated on a regular basis  the value of any enhancements that have been built into the deliverable and the characteristics of the varying markets in which the deliverable is sold 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions if the esp is not accurate  then the revenue allocated to each deliverable in a multiple element arrangement could be inaccurate resulting in the potential for revenue recognition in the wrong periods 
inventory policy we value our inventory at the lower of the cost of the inventory or market in a manner that approximates the first in first out method 
management assesses the recoverability of inventory based on types and levels of inventory held  product life cycles  and changes in technology 
a variety of methodologies are used to determine the amount of inventory write downs necessary to adjust excess and 
table of contents obsolete inventory 
write downs are based upon the age of the inventory  lower of cost or market  along with significant management judgments concerning future demands for the inventory 
if actual demand for our products is less than our estimates  or we experience a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  additional write downs for existing inventories might be recorded in future periods 
once recorded  inventory adjustments are not subsequently reversed until the inventory is used or disposed of 
judgments and uncertainties our inventory write downs involve uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding inventory aging  forecasted customer demand  and technological obsolescence 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions if estimates regarding customer demand are inaccurate or changes in technology affect demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner  we may be exposed to losses that could be material 
additional write downs would result in a charge to cost of goods sold to adjust inventory to its estimate net realizable value 
share based compensation policy we have share based compensation plans  which include stock options  restricted stock awards  and an employee stock purchase plan 
we estimate the fair value of stock options using the black scholes valuation model and the fair value of the company s restricted stock awards  which include shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units  based on the quoted market price of its common stock or the use of a monte carlo simulation model 
we recognize the associated share based compensation expense for time based awards on a straight line basis over the vesting periods of the awards  net of estimated forfeitures 
forfeiture rates are estimated based on historical pre vesting forfeitures and are updated on the vesting dates to reflect actual forfeitures 
the amount of share based compensation expense for performance based unvested restricted stock awards that is recognized on a straight line basis over the performance period is based upon the number of shares that management ultimately expects to vest 
for performance based awards with an earnings per share related target  management evaluates the probability of meeting the performance criteria at each balance sheet date and related compensation cost is amortized over the performance period on a straight line basis because such awards vest only at the end of the measurement period 
changes to the probability assessment and the estimate of shares expected to vest will result in adjustments to the related share based compensation expense that will be recorded in the period of the change 
if the performance is not achieved  no compensation cost is recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed 
for performance based awards with a market condition related target  related compensation cost is amortized over the performance period on a straight line basis  net of estimated forfeitures  regardless of whether the awards are ultimately earned 
judgments and uncertainties option pricing models and generally accepted valuation techniques to value restricted stock awards with market conditions require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards 
these assumptions and judgments include estimating the future volatility of our stock price  expected dividend yield  future employee turnover rates and future employee stock option exercise behaviors 
performance based non vested restricted stock awards require management to make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving future company financial targets or personal performance goals 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate and the amount of compensation expense we recognize 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  particularly those used in determining what the percentage of performance based non vested restricted stock awards that are expected to be earned  we may be exposed to changes in share based compensation expense that could be material 

table of contents warranty reserves policy we estimate the costs of product warranties based on specific warranty claims  historical data  and engineering estimates  where applicable 
judgments and uncertainties our warranty reserve involves uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions based on specific warranty claims  historical data  and engineering estimates  where applicable 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions if actual product failure rates or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
such revisions could adversely affect our operating results 
derivative instruments and hedging activities policy we recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or accumulated other comprehensive income loss  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction 
we classify the cash flows from these instruments in the same category as the cash flows from the hedged items 
we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
judgments and uncertainties we assess  both at inception and on an ongoing basis  whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows or fair values of the hedged items 
we also assess hedge ineffectiveness on a quarterly basis and record the gain or loss related to the ineffective portion to current earnings 
if we determine that a forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring  we discontinue hedge accounting for the affected portion of the hedge instrument  and any related unrealized gain or loss on the contract is recognized in current earnings 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions if we determine that a forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring  we discontinue hedge accounting for the affected portion of the hedge instrument  and any related unrealized gain or loss on the contract is recognized in current earnings 
purchase price allocation for business combinations policy we apply the purchase accounting method to account for business combinations  which requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to assign the purchase price to the fair value of the assets and liabilities purchased  with the excess value  if any  being classified as goodwill 
for those assets with finite lives  useful lives are assigned to those intangibles and their values are amortized over their remaining life 
judgments and uncertainties our purchase price allocation methodology involves uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities 
management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon widely accepted valuation techniques  including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses 
unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates  including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  accelerated amortization for intangible assets with finite lives or impairment charges for intangible assets or goodwill could be required 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets policy we evaluate goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets may 
table of contents not be recoverable 
we conduct our impairment evaluation by performing internal valuation analyses  which consider both the market approach and income approach for goodwill and the relief from royalty approach for the indefinite lived intangible assets under the market approach  the fair value of the reporting unit is based on trading and acquisition multiples 
under the income approach  the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
under the relief from royalty approach  the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset is based on after tax royalty rate and discount rate applied to future forecasted sales 
in the second quarter of fiscal year  we completed our annual impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets using the methodologies described herein  and determined there was no impairment 
the carrying values of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets related to acquisitions at july  were  and  respectively 
judgments and uncertainties the valuation analyses described above involve uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies 
it is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions  as well as our future expectations 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 
income tax contingencies policy our income tax returns  like those of most companies  are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities 
these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions  including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
at any one time  multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities 
in evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions  we record a liability for exposures subject to a minimum threshold of more likely than not before any benefit is recognized 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which we have established a liability  is audited and fully resolved or clarified 
we adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provision in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled  the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available 
judgments and uncertainties our liability for unrecognized tax benefits involves uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable  actual results could differ  and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established  or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability  the effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected 
an unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 
deferred tax valuation allowances policy we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions within which we operate 
this process involves assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from 
table of contents future taxable income and  to the extent that recovery is not more than likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
to the extent a valuation allowance is established  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
judgments and uncertainties our effective income tax rate is affected by changes in tax law  the tax jurisdiction of new business ventures  the level of earnings and where they came from  and the results of tax audits 
our deferred tax valuation allowances involve uncertainties because the calculations require management to make assumptions based on historical data  future book income  and tax planning strategies 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions in the event that actual results differ from the estimates and assumptions we use in determining our valuation allowances  the provision for income taxes and results of operations could be materially impacted 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all dollar amounts in this item a are in thousands 
certain of our foreign operations enter into transactions in currencies other than their functional currency  primarily the us dollar and the euro 
we also have foreign currency exposure arising from the translation of our net equity investment in our foreign operations to us dollars 
we generally view our investments in foreign operations with functional currencies other than the us dollar as long term 
the currencies to which we are exposed are the british pound  chinese yuan  canadian dollar  danish kroner  euro  and japanese yen 
a depreciation in the july  and functional currencies  relative to the us dollar  would result in a reduction of stockholders equity of approximately and  respectively 
at july   we had forward contracts outstanding with notional amounts totaling  in the canadian dollar 
these contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges  and the unrealized gains of  net of tax  as of july  on these contracts are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
no significant cash flow hedges were outstanding for periods prior to fiscal year realized gains and losses on the cash flow hedges are recognized in income in the period when the payment of expenses is recognized 
we expect all contracts to settle in the first two quarters of the year the fiscal year ended july   which we refer to as fiscal year and any amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income loss to be reported as an adjustment to operating expenses 
we place our cash and cash equivalents in high quality financial instruments and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution 
our cash includes cash equivalents  which we consider to be investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less 
investments having original maturities in excess of three months are stated at amortized cost  which approximates fair value  and are classified as held to maturity 
total net interest income for fiscal year was a change in interest income or interest rate would not have a material impact on the fair value of our portfolio or on future earnings
