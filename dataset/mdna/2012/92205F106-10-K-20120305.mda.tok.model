item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and the accompanying financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our future plans  estimates  forecasts  guidance  beliefs and expected performance 
the forward looking statements are dependent upon events  risks and uncertainties that may be outside our control 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  market prices for natural gas  production volumes  estimates of proved reserves  capital expenditures  economic and competitive conditions  regulatory changes and other uncertainties  as well as those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report  particularly in item a 
risk factors and forward looking statements  all of which are difficult to predict 
in light of these risks  uncertainties and assumptions  the forward looking events discussed may not occur 
overview we are a publicly traded limited liability company focused on the acquisition and development of mature  long lived oil and natural gas properties in the united states 
our primary business objective is to generate stable cash flows allowing us to make quarterly cash distributions to our unitholders and over time to increase our quarterly cash distributions through the acquisition of new oil and natural gas properties 
we own properties and oil and natural gas reserves primarily located in seven operating areas the permian basin in west texas and new mexico  the big horn basin in wyoming and montana  the southern portion of the appalachian basin  primarily in southeast kentucky and northeast tennessee  south texas  the williston basin in north dakota and montana  mississippi  and the arkoma basin in arkansas and oklahoma 
at december   we owned working interests in  gross  net productive wells 
in addition to these productive wells  we own leasehold acreage allowing us to drill new wells 
in the permian  big horn  south texas and williston basins  we own working interests ranging from in approximately  gross undeveloped acres surrounding our existing wells 
approximately or mmboe of our estimated proved reserves were attributable to our working interests in undeveloped acreage 
in february  we entered into a unit exchange agreement with our founding unitholder to transfer our ownership interests in oil and natural gas properties in the appalachian basin in exchange for million vnr common units with an effective date of january  as of december   based on a reserve report prepared by our independent reserve engineers  these interests had estimated total net proved reserves of mmboe  of which was natural gas and was proved developed 
this transaction is expected to close in march outlook our revenue  cash flow from operations and future growth depend substantially on factors beyond our control  such as access to capital  economic  political and regulatory developments  and competition from other sources of energy 
oil  natural gas and ngls prices historically have been volatile and may fluctuate widely in the future 
sustained periods of low prices for oil  natural gas and ngls could materially and adversely affect our financial position  our results of operations  the quantities of oil  natural gas and ngls reserves that we can economically produce  our access to capital and our ability to pay distributions 
we have mitigated the volatility on our cash flows through with oil and natural gas price derivative contracts 
these hedges are placed on a portion of our proved producing and a portion of our total anticipated production during this time frame 
as oil  natural gas and ngls prices fluctuate  we will recognize non cash  unrealized gains and losses in our consolidated statement of operations related to the change in fair value of our commodity derivative contracts 
we face the challenge of oil  natural gas and ngls production declines 
as a given well s initial reservoir pressures are depleted  oil  natural gas and ngls production decreases  thus reducing our total reserves 
we attempt to overcome this natural decline both by drilling on our properties and acquiring additional reserves 
we will maintain our focus on controlling costs to add reserves through drilling and acquisitions  as well as controlling the corresponding costs necessary to produce such reserves 
during the year ended december   we drilled and completed seven gross net wells on operated properties and drilled and completed eight gross net non operated wells 
our ability to add reserves through drilling is dependent on our capital resources and can be limited by many factors  including the ability to timely obtain drilling permits and regulatory approvals and voluntary reductions in capital spending in a low commodity price environment 
any delays in drilling  completion or connection to gathering lines of our new wells will negatively impact the rate of our production  which may have an adverse effect on our revenues and as a result  cash available for distribution 
in accordance with our business plan  we intend to invest the capital necessary to maintain our production at existing levels over the long term provided that it is economical to do so based on the commodity price environment 
however  we cannot be certain that we will be able to issue equity or debt securities on favorable terms  or at all  and we may be unable to refinance our reserve based credit facility when it expires 
additionally  in the event of significant declines in commodity prices  our borrowing base under our reserve based credit facility may be re determined such that it will not provide for the working capital necessary to fund our capital spending program and could affect our ability to make distributions 
the next scheduled redetermination of our borrowing base is april results of operations the following table sets forth selected financial and operating data for the periods indicated

excludes amortization of premiums paid and amortization of value on derivative contracts acquired 
the increase in oil  natural gas and ngls sales during the year ended december  compared to the same period in was due primarily to the increases in production from our acquisitions 
we experienced an increase in the average realized oil price  excluding hedges  and an decrease in the average realized natural gas sales price received  excluding hedges 
oil revenues increased from million during the year ended december  to million during the same period in as a result of a per bbl increase in our average realized oil price  excluding hedges  and a  mbbls increase in our oil production volumes 
our higher average realized oil price was primarily due to a higher average nymex price  which increased from per bbl during the year ended december  to per bbl during the same period in however  we did not recognize the entire benefit of the increase in the nymex oil price due to significant widening of the basis differential received on our oil primarily as a result of the temporary closure of exxon mobil s pipelines in wyoming during the third quarter due to leaks which affected production from enp s elk basin field where we had to settle for a lower price per barrel of oil produced during the closure 
natural gas revenues increased from million during the year ended december  to million during the same period in as a result of a increase in our natural gas production volumes from the wells acquired in the encore acquisition 
the impact of the increase in our natural gas production volumes was offset by a per mcf decrease in our average realized natural gas price  excluding hedges  primarily due to a lower average nymex price  which decreased from per mcf during the year ended december  to per mcf during the same period in additionally  our total production increased by on a boe basis 
the increase in production for the year ended december  over the comparable period in was primarily attributable to the impact from the encore acquisition completed in december and all of the additional acquisitions completed during the on a boe basis  crude oil  natural gas and ngls accounted for  and  respectively  of our production during the year ended december  compared to crude oil  natural gas  and ngls of  and  respectively  during the same period in hedging and price risk management activities during the year ended december   we recognized a million realized gain on other commodity derivative contracts related to the settlements recognized during the period and a million loss related to the change in fair value of derivative contracts not meeting the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting 
these realized and unrealized gains and losses resulted from the changes in commodity prices  and the effect of these price changes is discussed in the paragraph below 
during the years ended december  and  we recognized million and million in losses on commodity cash flow hedges that previously met the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting  respectively 
these amounts relate to derivative contracts that we entered into in order to mitigate commodity price exposure on a portion of our expected production and designated as cash flow hedges 
they were later de designated as cash flow hedges and the losses for the years ended december  and relate to amounts that settled in the respective periods which have been reclassified to earnings from accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the purpose of our hedging program is to mitigate the volatility in our operating cash flow 
depending on the type of derivative contract used  hedging generally achieves this by the counterparty paying us when commodity prices are below the hedged price and we pay the counterparty when commodity prices are above the hedged price 
in either case  the impact on our operating cash flow is approximately the same 
however  because the majority of our hedges are not designated as cash flow hedges  there can be a significant amount of volatility in our earnings when we record the change in the fair value of all of our derivative contracts 
as commodity prices fluctuate  the fair value of those contracts will fluctuate and the impact is reflected as a non cash  unrealized gain or loss in our consolidated statement of operations 
however  these fair value changes that are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations only reflect the value of the derivative contracts to be settled in the future and do not take into consideration the value of the underlying commodity 
if the fair value of the derivative contract goes down  it means that the value of the commodity being hedged has gone up  and the net impact to our cash flow when the contract settles and the commodity is sold in the market will be approximately the same 
conversely  if the fair value of the derivative contract goes up  it means the value of the commodity being hedged has gone down and again the net impact to our operating cash flow when the contract settles and the commodity is sold in the market will be approximately the same for the quantities hedged 
costs and expenses lease operating expenses include third party transportation costs  gathering and compression fees  field personnel  and other customary charges 
lease operating expenses increased by million to million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   of which million related to the encore acquisition and to increased lease operating expenses for oil and natural gas properties acquired during additionally  contributing to this increase were higher lease operating expenses for wells acquired in the parker creek acquisition and the permian basin i acquisition 
production and other taxes include severance  ad valorem and other taxes 
severance taxes are a function of volumes and revenues generated from production 
ad valorem taxes vary by state county and are based on the value of our reserves 
production taxes increased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  primarily due to higher wellhead revenues  which exclude the effects of commodity derivative contracts 
severance taxes increased by million as a result of increased oil  natural gas and ngls production due to the encore acquisition 
ad valorem taxes increased by million primarily due to the taxes on oil and natural gas properties acquired in the encore acquisition 
as a percentage of wellhead revenues  production  severance  and ad valorem taxes increased from for the year ended december  to during the year ended december  depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion increased to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december  due primarily to approximately million additional depletion recorded on oil and natural gas properties acquired in the encore acquisition and oil and natural gas properties acquired during selling  general and administrative expenses include the costs of our administrative employees and executive officers  related benefits  office leases  professional fees and other costs not directly associated with field operations 
these expenses for the year ended december  increased million as compared to the year ended december  principally due to approximately million in incremental costs related to enp  a million increase in compensation related expenses due to the hiring of additional personnel and expanding operations in connection with the enp acquisition  a million increase in non cash compensation charges related to the grant of units to employees and the grant of phantom units to officers and a million increase in general office expenses also resulting from our expanding operations 
additionally  during we incurred million in non recurring transaction costs in connection with the enp purchase 
other income and expense interest expense increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  primarily due to approximately million of interest expense on the term loan as discussed below borrowed in connection with the encore acquisition  million of interest expense incurred for the enp credit agreement as discussed below and higher average outstanding debt under our reserve based credit facility during the year ended december  in accordance with the guidance contained within asc topic  business combinations  asc topic  the measurement of the fair value at acquisition date of the assets acquired in the acquisitions completed during compared to the fair value of consideration transferred  adjusted for purchase price adjustments  resulted in goodwill of million  which was immediately impaired and recorded as a loss  and a gain of million for the year ended december   resulting in a combined net loss of million 
the measurement of the fair value at acquisition date of the assets acquired in the parker creek acquisition as compared to the fair value of consideration transferred  adjusted for purchase price adjustments  resulted in goodwill of million  which was immediately impaired and recorded as a loss for the year ended december  the gain and losses resulted from the increases and decreases in oil and natural gas prices used to value the reserves and has been recognized in current period earnings and classified in other income and expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations

also  during  we acquired certain oil and natural gas properties and related assets  as well as additional interests in these assets  in south texas from the sun tsh acquisition 
the operating results of these properties are included with ours from the date of acquisition forward 
south texas area includes production from the dos hermanos  sun tsh and a portion of the parker creek acquisitions 
during  we acquired certain oil and natural gas properties and related assets  as well as additional interests in these assets  in mississippi 
the operating results of these properties are included with ours from the date of acquisition forward 
excludes results from hedging activities 
the increase in oil  natural gas and ngls sales during the year ended december  compared to the same period in was due primarily to the increases in commodity prices and an increase in production 
we experienced a increase in the average realized natural gas sales price received excluding hedges and a increase in the average realized oil price excluding hedges 
additionally  our total production increased by on a boe basis 
the increase in production for the year ended december  over the comparable period in was primarily attributable to the impact from the sun tsh  ward county and parker creek acquisitions completed in august  december and may  respectively 
in appalachia  we experienced a decrease in natural gas production which was partially offset by a increase in oil production during year ended december  compared to the same period in for a net production decline of on a boe basis 
while our natural gas wells had lower production during  we experienced a increase in appalachian oil production primarily due to our focus on completing seven vertical oil wells in hedging and price risk management activities during the years ended december  and  we recognized million and million in losses on commodity cash flow hedges  respectively 
these amounts relate to derivative contracts we entered into in order to mitigate commodity price exposure on a portion of our expected production and designated as cash flow hedges 
the losses on commodity cash flow hedges for the years ended december  and relate to the amounts that settled in those years and have been reclassified to earnings from accumulated other comprehensive loss 
during the years ended december  and  we recognized a million and million realized gain on other commodity derivative contracts  respectively  related to the settlements recognized during those periods and a million and million loss related to the change in fair value of derivative contracts not meeting the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting in those periods  respectively 
costs and expenses lease operating expenses in appalachia historically included a per well per month administrative charge pursuant to a management services agreement with vinland 
this fee was temporarily increased to per well per month beginning march  through december  pursuant to an agreement whereunder vinland provided well tending services on vanguard owned wells under a turnkey pricing contract 
in addition  we historically have paid a per mcf and per mcf gathering and compression charge for production from wells drilled pre and post january   respectively  to vinland pursuant to a gathering and compression agreement with vinland 
this gathering and compression agreement was amended for the period beginning march  through december  to provide for a temporary fee based upon the actual costs incurred by vinland to provide gathering and transportation services plus a per mcf margin 
both temporary amendments expired on december  and all the terms of the agreements reverted back to the original agreements 
in june  we began discussions with vinland regarding an amendment to the gathering and compression agreement which would go into effect beginning on july  the amended agreement would provide gathering and compression services based upon actual costs plus a margin of 
per mcf 
we and vinland agreed in principle to this change effective july   and we have jointly operated on this basis although the formal agreements have yet to be signed 
lease operating expenses increased by million to million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  of which million related to the sun tsh and ward county and parker creek acquisitions and million related to increase lease operating expenses for wells in appalachia 
production and other taxes increased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in severance taxes increased million as a result of increased oil  natural gas and ngls sales 
texas margin and other corporate taxes increased by million and ad valorem taxes increased by million primarily due to an increase of million in the taxes on oil and natural gas properties acquired in the sun tsh  ward county and parker creek acquisitions  offset by a million decrease in the taxes on appalachia properties 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion increased to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december  due primarily to the additional depletion recorded on the oil and natural gas properties acquired in the sun tsh  ward county and parker creek acquisitions 
an impairment of oil and natural gas properties in the amount of million was recognized during the year ended december  as the unamortized cost of oil and natural gas properties exceeded the sum of the estimated future net revenues from proved properties using the month average price of oil and natural gas  discounted at and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties 
the impairment for the first quarter was million as a result of a decline in natural gas prices at the measurement date  march  this impairment was calculated based on prices of per mmbtu for natural gas and per barrel of crude oil 
the sec s final rule  modernization of oil and gas reporting  which became effective december   changed the price used to calculate oil and gas reserves to a month average price rather than a year end price 
as a result of declines in oil and natural gas prices based upon the month average price  we recorded an additional impairment of million in the fourth quarter of this impairment was calculated using the month average price for natural gas and oil of per mmbtu for natural gas and per barrel of crude oil 
the majority of the fourth quarter impairment was incurred on properties that we acquired in the last six months of when oil and natural gas prices were higher than the month average price 
we were able to lock in the higher prices at the time of the acquisitions for a substantial portion of the expected production through for natural gas and for crude oil by using commodity derivative contracts 
however  the impairment calculation did not consider the positive impact of our commodity derivative positions as generally accepted accounting principles only allow the inclusion of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges 
no impairment of oil and natural gas properties was necessary during the year ended december  in addition  our analysis of goodwill concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill as of december  selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  decreased million as compared to the year ended december  principally due to a decrease in non cash compensation charges related to the grant of restricted class b units to officers and an employee  the grant of phantom units to officers and the grant of common units to board members and employees 
non cash compensation charges declined million to million for the year ended december  offsetting this decline was a million increase in general and administrative expenses primarily related to transaction costs incurred in connection with the enp acquisition and a million increase in bonuses awarded to employees 
other income and expense interest expense increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  primarily due to higher interest rates and higher average outstanding debt for the year ended december  critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
certain accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions  or if different assumptions had been used 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements 
below  we have provided expanded discussion of our more significant accounting policies  estimates and judgments 
we have discussed the development  selection and disclosure of each of these with our audit committee 
we believe these accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements
