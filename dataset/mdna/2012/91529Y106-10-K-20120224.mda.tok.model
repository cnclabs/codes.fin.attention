item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion and analysis presented in this section should be read in conjunction with the cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements included below the table of contents  risk factors included in item a  selected financial data included in item  and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item executive summary during  our focus continued to be on disciplined top line growth and capital management 
objectives for included continue to consistently execute against our operating plans  which emphasize disciplined  profitable growth  further enhance our financial flexibility through solid operating and investment performance and a sustainable capital deployment strategy  leverage our capabilities  products  relationships  and reputation to deliver on our commitments as well as our bottom line targets  continue to invest in our businesses and leverage global capabilities to capitalize on current and future growth opportunities 
a discussion of our operating performance and capital management follows 
operating performance and capital management for we reported net income of million  or per diluted common share  compared to million  or per diluted common share  for after tax operating income was million  or per diluted common share  in compared to million  or per diluted common share  in separate and distinct from our underlying operating results and excluded from after tax operating income are the fourth quarter of charges related to our long term care product line strategic review as well as a claim reserve increase in our individual disability closed block of business to reflect our current estimate of future benefit obligations 
also excluded from after tax operating income are a reduction in our income tax resulting from a tax settlement  an increase in our income tax related to dividends from our uk subsidiaries  and an increase in our income tax related to the impact of the tax law change associated with healthcare reform 
our net income per share and after tax operating income per share  as compared to the prior year period  benefited from the repurchase of our common stock during and total operating revenue in by segment was marginally higher than  with the current economic environment continuing to negatively impact our premium growth 
total operating income by segment  excluding the charges related to our long term care and individual disability closed blocks of business  was generally consistent with the level of  with higher earnings in unum us partially offset by lower earnings in our other core segments  as well as lower earnings in the corporate segment 
see additional information presented in this executive summary under long term care strategic review and claim reserve increase for individual disability closed block business as well as consolidated operating results and reconciliation of non gaap financial measures contained herein in item our unum us segment reported an increase in segment operating income of percent in compared to  with higher operating revenue and favorable risk results 
the benefit ratio for the unum us segment for was percent  compared to percent in  with favorable risk results for the supplemental and voluntary products partially offset by less favorable risk results for the group disability and group life and accidental death and dismemberment products as compared to although unum us premium income increased slightly in compared to  the ongoing high levels of unemployment and the competitive environment continued to pressure our premium income growth 
in particular  premium growth from existing customers throughout continued to be unfavorably impacted by lower salary growth and lower growth in the number of employees covered under existing policies 
unum us sales increased percent in compared to we experienced sales increases in nearly all of our product lines and market segments in compared to voluntary benefits sales increased percent in compared to our group core market segment  which we define for unum us as employee groups with fewer than  lives  reported sales increases of percent in relative to persistency  although below the level of last year for some of our unum us product lines  remains high relative to historical levels 
our unum uk segment reported a decrease in segment operating income of percent in  as measured in unum uk s local currency  relative to the decrease was driven by less favorable risk results and higher expenses related to unum uk s growth plans 
premium income grew percent in relative to  although premium growth continued to be pressured by pricing actions resulting from the competitive uk market 
the benefit ratio for unum uk was percent in compared to percent in  driven by less favorable risk experience in group long term disability 
unum uk sales  which were also negatively impacted by the economy and the competitive pricing environment  declined percent relative to  as measured in unum uk s local currency 
persistency in was below the level of but remains strong 
our colonial life segment operating income in was consistent with the level of although premium income grew percent in compared to  risk results were less favorable  with an overall benefit ratio of percent in compared to percent in  due primarily from less favorable risk results in the accident  sickness  and disability product line 
colonial life s sales increased percent in relative to the number of new agent contracts increased percent in relative to  but the number of new accounts declined by percent 
persistency in was below the level of but remains strong 
our investment portfolio continued to perform well  with an increase in net investment income of percent in relative to the net unrealized gain on our fixed maturity securities was billion at december   compared to billion at december   driven primarily by a decline in us treasury rates 
we believe our capital and financial positions are strong 
at december   the risk based capital rbc ratio for our traditional us insurance subsidiaries  calculated on a weighted average basis using the naic company action level formula  was approximately percent  compared to percent at december  our leverage ratio  when calculated using consolidated debt to total consolidated capital  was percent at december   compared to percent at december  the increase was due primarily to million of securities lending agreements outstanding at december   partially offset by the maturity of million of senior notes and our principal payments on the debt of northwind holdings  llc northwind holdings and tailwind holdings  llc tailwind holdings 
our leverage ratio  when calculated excluding the non recourse debt and associated capital of northwind holdings and tailwind holdings and the short term debt arising from securities lending agreements  was percent at december   compared to percent at december  the cash and marketable securities at our holding companies equaled approximately million at december   compared to billion at december  during  we repurchased million shares of unum group s common stock at a cost of million 
we have completed the million share repurchase program authorized in and purchased million under our billion share repurchase program authorized in february despite the difficult economic environment  we continue to make steady and disciplined progress  executing on our business plans and maintaining our strong financial position 
we remain cautious of the near term outlook for employment levels and wages  both of which limit opportunities for premium growth  but we believe we are poised to profitably grow as employment trends improve 
further discussion is included in segment results  investments  and liquidity and capital resources contained in this item long term care strategic review following a comprehensive and strategic review of our long term care business  in february we announced that we would discontinue selling group long term care 
we discontinued selling individual long term care during because both group and individual long term care are now considered closed blocks of business  effective december   we reclassified our long term care products from the unum us segment to the closed block segment 
we also reclassified our other insurance products not actively marketed  including individual life and corporate owned life insurance  reinsurance pools and management operations  group pension  health insurance  and individual annuities  which were previously reported in the corporate and other segment to the closed block segment 
the inclusion of all closed blocks of business into one operating segment aligns with our reporting and monitoring of our closed blocks of business within a discrete segment and is consistent with our separation of these blocks of business from the lines of business which actively market new products 
prior period segment results have been restated to reflect these changes in our reporting classifications 
as part of the strategic review  and as is typical in the fourth quarter of each year  we analyzed our reserve assumptions for long term care in conjunction with our annual loss recognition testing 
we generally perform loss recognition tests on our deferred acquisition costs and policy reserves in the fourth quarter of each year  but more frequently if appropriate  using best estimate assumptions as of the date of the test 
included in the analysis was a review of our reserve discount rate assumptions and mortality and morbidity assumptions 
our analysis of reserve discount rate assumptions considered the significant decline in long term interest rates which occurred late in the third quarter of due to the european union debt crisis and the federal reserve board s actions  including the announcement of operation twist 
we also considered an updated industry study for long term care experience which was made available mid year from the society of actuaries 
our analysis of this study  which was completed during the fourth quarter of  showed that lower termination rates than we had previously assumed were beginning to emerge in industry and in our own company experience 
based on our analysis  as of december  we lowered the discount rate assumption to reflect the low interest rate environment and our expectation of future investment portfolio yield rates 
we also changed our mortality assumptions to reflect emerging experience due to an increase in life expectancies which increases the ultimate number of people who will utilize long term care benefits and also lengthens the amount of time a claimant receives long term care benefits 
we changed our morbidity assumptions to reflect emerging industry experience as well as our own company experience 
while our morbidity experience is still emerging and is not fully credible  we modified our assumptions to align more closely with the recently published industry study 
using our revised best estimate assumptions  as of december  we determined that deferred acquisition costs of million were not recoverable and that our policy and claim reserves should be increased by million to reflect our current estimate of future benefit obligations 
these charges decreased our net income by million 
the increase in reserves represented a percent increase in long term care policy and claim reserves as of december   which equal billion subsequent to the charge 
claim reserve increase for individual disability closed block business claim reserves supporting our individual disability closed block of business are calculated using assumptions based on actual experience believed to be currently appropriate 
claim reserves are subject to revision as current claim experience emerges and alters our view of future expectations 
claim resolution rates  which measure the resolution of claims from recovery  deaths  settlements  and benefit expirations  are very sensitive to operational and environmental changes and can be volatile 
our claim resolution rate assumption used in determining reserves is our expectation of the resolution rate we will experience over the life of the block of business 
we are now able  with a higher degree of confidence  to assess our own experience for older ages in our long duration lifetime claim block as our data has become credible 
there is very little industry experience for lifetime disability benefits  as our insurance companies were the primary disability companies in the insurance industry at the time lifetime disability benefits were offered 
these benefits were offered during the s and s  recent enough such that claimants are just reaching the older ages and providing us with data to build our claim experience base 
emerging experience indicates a longer life expectancy for our older age  longer duration disabled claimants  which lengthens the time a claimant receives disability benefits 
as a result of this experience  as of december  we adjusted our mortality assumption within our claim resolution rate assumption and  as a result  increased our claim reserves for our individual disability closed block of business by million and decreased net income by million 
the increase in reserves represented a percent increase in individual disability policy and claim reserves as of december   which equal billion subsequent to the charge 
outlook for during  we intend to remain focused on disciplined top line growth in select markets and a sustainable capital generation and deployment strategy 
we continue to believe that our strategy of delivering a broad set of financial protection choices to employees while also enabling employers to define their financial contribution in support of those choices should enable us to continue in a leadership position in our markets over the long term 
critical accounting estimates we prepare our financial statements in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known  which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed in our financial statements 
the accounting estimates deemed to be most critical to our financial position and results of operations are those related to reserves for policy and contract benefits  deferred acquisition costs  valuation of investments  pension and postretirement benefit plans  income taxes  and contingent liabilities 
for additional information  refer to our significant accounting policies in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item reserves for policy and contract benefits our largest liabilities are reserves for claims that we estimate we will eventually pay to our policyholders 
the two primary categories of reserves are policy reserves for claims not yet incurred and claim reserves for claims that have been incurred or are estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported to us 
these reserves equaled billion and billion at december  and  respectively  or approximately percent and percent of our total liabilities  respectively 
reserves ceded to reinsurers were billion at both december  and  and are reported as a reinsurance recoverable in our consolidated balance sheets 
policy reserves policy reserves are established in the same period we issue a policy and equal the difference between projected future policy benefits and future premiums  allowing a margin for expenses and profit 
these reserves relate primarily to our traditional non interest sensitive products  including our individual disability and voluntary benefits products in our unum us segment  individual disability products in our unum uk segment  disability and cancer and critical illness policies in our colonial life segment  and individual disability and long term care products in our closed block segment 
the reserves are calculated based on assumptions that were appropriate at the date the policy was issued and are not subsequently modified unless the policy reserves become inadequate ie loss recognition occurs 
persistency assumptions are based on our actual historical experience adjusted for future expectations 
claim incidence and claim resolution rate assumptions related to mortality and morbidity are based on actual experience or industry standards adjusted as appropriate to reflect our actual experience and future expectations 
discount rate assumptions are based on our current and expected net investment returns 
in establishing policy reserves  we use assumptions that reflect our best estimate while considering the potential for adverse variances in actual future experience  which results in a total policy reserve balance that has an embedded reserve for adverse deviation 
we do not  however  establish an explicit and separate reserve as a provision for adverse deviation from our assumptions 
we perform loss recognition tests on our policy reserves annually  or more frequently if appropriate  using best estimate assumptions as of the date of the test  without a provision for adverse deviation 
we group the policy reserves for each major product line within a segment when we perform the loss recognition tests 
if the policy reserves determined using these best estimate assumptions are higher than our existing policy reserves net of any deferred acquisition cost balance  the existing policy reserves are increased or deferred acquisition costs are reduced to immediately recognize the deficiency 
thereafter  the policy reserves for the product line are calculated using the same method we used for the loss recognition testing  referred to as the gross premium valuation method  wherein we use our best estimate as of the gross premium valuation loss recognition date rather than the initial policy issue date to determine the expected future claims  commissions  and expenses we will pay and the expected future gross premiums we will receive 
because the key policy reserve assumptions for policy persistency  mortality and morbidity  and discount rates are all locked in at policy issuance based on assumptions appropriate at that time  policy reserve assumptions are generally not changed due to a change in claim status from active to disabled subsequent to policy issuance 
therefore  we maintain policy reserves for a policy for as long as the policy remains in force  even after a separate claim reserve is established 
incidence rates in industry standard valuation tables for policy reserves have traditionally included all lives  active and disabled 
in addition  the waiver of premium provision provides funding for the policy reserve while a policyholder is disabled 
as a result  the funding mechanisms and the cost of claims are aligned and require a policy reserve to be held while on claim 
in addition  most policies allow for multiple occurrences of claims  and a policy reserve is consequently still maintained at the time of claim to fund any potential future claims 
the policy reserves build up and release over time based on assumptions made at the time of policy issuance such that the reserve is eliminated as policyholders reach the terminal age for coverage  die  or voluntarily lapse the policy 
policy reserves for unum us  unum uk  and colonial life products  which at december  represented approximately percent  percent  and percent  respectively  of our total gross policy reserves  are determined using the net level premium method as prescribed by gaap 
in applying this method  we use  as applicable by product type  morbidity and mortality incidence rate assumptions  claim resolution rate assumptions  and policy persistency assumptions  among others  to determine our expected future claim payments and expected future premium income 
we then apply an interest  or discount  rate to determine the present value of the expected future claims and claim expenses we will pay and the expected future premiums we will receive  with a provision for profit allowed 
policy reserves for our closed block segment include certain older policy forms for individual disability  individual and group long term care  and certain other products  all of which are no longer actively marketed 
the reserves for individual disability and individual and group long term care  which represented approximately percent of our total gross policy reserves at december   are determined using the gross premium valuation method 
reserves for individual disability are based on assumptions established as of january   the date of loss recognition 
reserves for long term care are based on assumptions established as of december   the date of loss recognition 
key assumptions are persistency  mortality  claim incidence  claim resolution rates  commission rates  and maintenance expense rates 
we apply an interest  or discount  rate to determine the present value of the expected future claims  commissions  and expenses we will pay as well as the expected future premiums we will receive  with no provision for future profit 
the interest rate is based on our expected net investment returns on the investment portfolio supporting the reserves for these blocks of business 
under the gross premium valuation method  we do not include an embedded provision for the risk of adverse deviation from these assumptions 
gross premium valuation assumptions do not change after the date of loss recognition unless reserves are again determined to be deficient 
we perform loss recognition tests on the policy reserves for this block of business annually  or more frequently if appropriate 
policy reserves for certain other products no longer actively marketed and reported in our closed block segment represent billion on a gross basis  or approximately percent of our total policy reserves 
we have ceded billion of the related policy reserves to reinsurers 
the ceded reserve balance is reported in our consolidated balance sheets as a reinsurance recoverable 
we continue to service a block of group pension products  which we have not ceded  and the policy reserves for these products are based on expected mortality rates and retirement rates 
expected future payments are discounted at interest rates reflecting the anticipated investment returns for the assets supporting the liabilities 
claim reserves claim reserves are established when a claim is incurred or is estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported ibnr to us and  as prescribed by gaap  equals our long term best estimate of the present value of the liability for future claim payments and claim adjustment expenses 
a claim reserve is based on actual known facts regarding the claim  such as the benefits available under the applicable policy  the covered benefit period  and the age and occupation of the claimant  as well as assumptions derived from our actual historical experience and expected future changes in experience for factors such as the claim duration and discount rate 
reserves for ibnr claims  similar to incurred claim reserves  include our assumptions for claim duration and discount rates but because we do not yet know the facts regarding the specific claims  are also based on historical incidence rate assumptions  including claim reporting patterns  the average cost of claims  and the expected volumes of incurred claims 
our incurred claim reserves and ibnr claim reserves do not include any provision for the risk of adverse deviation from our assumptions 
claim reserves  unlike policy reserves  are subject to revision as current claim experience and projections of future factors affecting claim experience change 
each quarter we review our emerging experience to ensure that our claim reserves are appropriate 
if we believe  based on our actual experience and our view of future events  that our long term assumptions need to be modified  we adjust our reserves accordingly with a charge or credit to our current period income 
multiple estimation methods exist to establish claim reserve liabilities  with each method having its own advantages and disadvantages 
available reserving methods utilized to calculate claim reserves include the tabular reserve method  the paid development method  the incurred loss development method  the count and severity method  and the expected claim cost method 
no single method is better than the others in all situations and for all product lines 
the estimation methods we have chosen are those that we believe produce the most reliable reserves 
claim reserves supporting our unum us group and individual disability product lines and our closed block individual disability and individual and group long term care product lines represent approximately percent and percent  respectively  of our total claim reserves at december  we use a tabular reserve methodology for group and individual long term disability and group and individual long term care claims that have been reported 
under the tabular reserve methodology  reserves for reported claims are based on certain characteristics of the actual reported claimants  such as age  length of time disabled  and medical diagnosis 
we believe the tabular reserve method is the most accurate to calculate long term liabilities and allows us to use the most available known facts about each claim 
ibnr claim reserves for our long term products are calculated using the count and severity method using historical patterns of the claims to be reported and the associated claim costs 
for unum us group short term disability products  an estimate of the value of future payments to be made on claims already submitted  as well as ibnr claims  is determined in aggregate rather than on the individual claimant basis that we use for our long term products  using historical patterns of claim incidence as well as historical patterns of aggregate claim resolution rates 
the average length of time between the event triggering a claim under a policy and the final resolution of those claims is much shorter for these products than for our long term liabilities and results in less estimation variability 
claim reserves supporting the unum us group life and accidental death and dismemberment products represent approximately percent of our total claim reserves at december  claim reserves for these products are related primarily to death claims reported but not yet paid  ibnr death claims  and a liability for waiver of premium benefits 
the death claim reserve is based on the actual face amount to be paid  the ibnr reserve is calculated using the count and severity method  and the waiver of premium benefits reserve is calculated using the tabular reserve methodology 
claim reserves supporting our unum uk segment represent approximately percent of our total claim reserves at december   and are calculated using generally the same methodology that we use for unum us disability and group life reserves 
the assumptions used in calculating claim reserves for this line of business are based on standard united kingdom industry experience  adjusted for unum uk s own experience 
the majority of the colonial life segment lines of business have short term benefits  which generally have less estimation variability than our long term products because of the shorter claim payout period 
our claim reserves for colonial life s lines of business  which approximate percent of our total claim reserves at december   are predominantly determined using the incurred loss development method based on our own experience 
the incurred loss development method uses the historical patterns of payments by loss date to predict future claim payments for each loss date 
where the incurred loss development method may not be appropriate  we estimate the incurred claims using an expected claim cost per policy or other measure of exposure 
the key assumptions for claim reserves for the colonial life lines of business are the timing  rate  and amount of estimated future claim payments  and the estimated expenses associated with the payment of claims 
the following table displays policy reserves  incurred claim reserves  and ibnr claim reserves by major product line  with the summation of the policy reserves and claim reserves shown both gross and net of the associated reinsurance recoverable 
incurred claim reserves represent reserves determined for each incurred claim and also include estimated amounts for litigation expenses and other expenses associated with the payment of the claims as well as provisions for claims which we estimate will be reopened for our long term care products 
ibnr claim reserves include provisions for incurred but not reported claims and a provision for reopened claims for our disability products 
the ibnr and reopened claim reserves for our disability products are developed and maintained in aggregate based on historical monitoring that has only been on a combined basis

of these assumptions  our discount rate and claim resolution rate assumptions have historically had the most significant effects on our level of reserves because many of our product lines provide benefit payments over an extended period of time 
the discount rate  which is used in calculating both policy reserves and incurred and ibnr claim reserves  is the interest rate that we use to discount future claim payments to determine the present value 
a higher discount rate produces a lower reserve 
if the discount rate is higher than our future investment returns  our invested assets will not earn enough investment income to support our future claim payments 
in this case  the reserves may eventually be insufficient 
we set our assumptions based on our current and expected future investment yield of the assets supporting the reserves  considering current and expected future market conditions 
if the investment yield on new investments that are purchased is below or above the investment yield of the existing investment portfolio  it is likely that the discount rate assumption on claims will be established to reflect the effect of the new investment yield 
the claim resolution rate  used for both policy reserves and incurred and ibnr claim reserves  is the probability that a disability or long term care claim will close due to recovery or death of the insured 
it is important because it is used to estimate how long benefits will be paid for a claim 
estimated resolution rates that are set too high will result in reserves that are lower than they need to be to pay the claim benefits over time 
claim resolution assumptions involve many factors  including the cause of disability  the policyholder s age  the type of contractual benefits provided  and the time since initially becoming disabled 
we primarily use our own claim experience to develop our claim resolution assumptions 
these assumptions are established for the probability of death and the probability of recovery from disability 
our studies review actual claim resolution experience over a number of years  with more weight placed on our experience in the more recent years 
we also consider any expected future changes in claim resolution experience 
the incidence rate  used for policy reserves and ibnr claim reserves  is the rate at which new claims are submitted to us 
the incidence rate is affected by many factors  including the age of the insured  the insured s occupation or industry  the benefit plan design  and certain external factors such as consumer confidence and levels of unemployment 
we establish our incidence assumption using a historical review of actual incidence results along with an outlook of future incidence expectations 
establishing reserve assumptions is complex and involves many factors 
reserves  particularly for policies offering insurance coverage for long term disabilities and long term care  are dependent on numerous assumptions other than just those presented in the preceding discussion 
the impact of internal and external events  such as changes in claims management procedures  economic trends such as the rate of unemployment and the level of consumer confidence  the emergence of new diseases  new trends and developments in medical treatments  and legal trends and legislative changes  among other factors  will influence claim incidence and resolution rates 
in addition  for policies offering coverage for disability or long term care at advanced ages  the level and pattern of mortality rates at advanced ages will impact overall benefit costs 
reserve assumptions differ by product line and by policy type within a product line 
additionally  in any period and over time  our actual experience may have a positive or negative variance from our long term assumptions  either singularly or collectively  and these variances may offset each other 
we test the overall adequacy of our reserves using all assumptions and with a long term view of our expected experience over the life of a block of business rather than test just one or a few assumptions independently that may be aberrant over a short period of time 
therefore it is not possible to bifurcate the assumptions to evaluate the sensitivity of a change in each assumption  but rather in the aggregate by product line 
we have presented in the following section an overview of our trend analysis for key assumptions and the results of variability in our assumptions  in aggregate  for the reserves which we believe are reasonably possible to have a material impact on our future financial results if actual claims yield a materially different amount than what we currently expect and have reserved for  either favorable or unfavorable 
trends in key assumptions generally  we do not expect our mortality and morbidity claim incidence trends or our persistency trends to change significantly in the short term  and to the extent that these trends do change  we expect those changes to be gradual over a longer period of time 
however  we have historically experienced an increase in our group long term disability morbidity claim incidence trends during and following a recessionary period  particularly in our unum us operations 
during  claim incidence rates for unum us group long term disability were slightly elevated 
given the current economic conditions  it is possible that our claim incidence rates for this type of product may increase 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed an extensive review of experience factors for our long term care business using emerging industry experience as well as our own company experience 
an updated industry study for long term care experience was made available mid year from the society of actuaries which allowed us to compare our limited company experience to broader industry experience and trends 
the trends reflected in emerging industry experience  as well as our own company experience  resulted in a modification to our mortality and morbidity assumptions  which together with the decline in interest rates as noted below  resulted in our recognition of a loss deficiency in our long term care closed block of business as of december  see long term care strategic review contained in this item throughout the period to  actual new money interest rates varied with the changing market conditions  and the assumptions we used to discount our reserves generally trended downward slightly for all segments and product lines 
late in the third quarter of  long term interest rates declined significantly due to the european union debt crisis and the federal reserve board s actions  including the announcement of operation twist 
reserve discount rate assumptions for new policies and new claims have been adjusted to reflect our current and expected net investment returns 
changes in our average discount rate assumptions tend to occur gradually over a longer period of time because of the long duration investment portfolio needed to support the reserves for the majority of our lines of business 
both the mortality rate experience and the retirement rate experience for our block of group pension products have remained stable and consistent with expectations 
claim resolution rates have a greater chance of significant variability in a shorter period of time than our other reserve assumptions 
these rates are reviewed on a quarterly basis for the death and recovery components separately 
claim resolution rates in our unum us segment group and individual long term disability product lines and our closed block individual disability product line have over the last several years exhibited some variability 
relative to the resolution rate we expect to experience over the life of the block of business  actual quarterly rates during and have varied by and percent in our unum us group long term disability line of business  between and percent in our unum us individual disability recently issued line of business  and between and percent in our closed block individual disability line of business 
claim resolution rates are very sensitive to operational and environmental changes and can be volatile over short periods of time 
throughout the period to  we had generally stable to improving claims management performance  and our claim resolution rates were fairly consistent with or slightly favorable to our long term assumptions 
our claim resolution rate assumption used in determining reserves is our expectation of the resolution rate we will experience over the life of the block of business and will vary from actual experience in any one period  both favorably and unfavorably 
as our claims data for older ages in our long duration lifetime claim block in our closed block individual disability line of business has become credible  we are now able  with a higher degree of confidence  to assess our own experience for this particular claim block 
emerging experience indicates a longer life expectancy for our older age  longer duration disabled claimants  which lengthens the time a claimant receives disability benefits 
as a result of this experience  as of december  we adjusted our mortality assumption within our claim resolution rate assumption  resulting in an increase of million in our closed block individual disability line of business claim reserves 
see claim reserve increase for individual disability closed block business contained in this item we monitor and test our reserves for adequacy relative to all of our assumptions in the aggregate 
in our estimation  scenarios based on reasonably possible variations in each of our reserve assumptions  when modeled together in aggregate  could produce a potential result  either positive or negative  in our unum us group disability line of business that would change our claim reserve balance by percent 
using our actual claim reserve balance at december   this variation would have resulted in an approximate change either positive or negative of million to our claim reserves 
using the same sensitivity analysis approach for our closed block individual disability line of business  the claim reserve balance could potentially vary by percent of our reported balance  which at december   would have resulted in an approximate change either positive or negative of million to our claim reserves 
the major contributor to the variance for both the unum us group long term disability line of business and the closed block individual disability line of business is the claim resolution rate 
in addition  we consider variability in our reserve assumptions related to long term care policy reserves 
these reserves are held under the gross premium valuation method with assumptions established as of december   the date of loss recognition 
assumptions for policy reserves do not change after the date of loss recognition unless reserves are again determined to be deficient 
as such  positive developments will result in the accumulation of reserve margin  while adverse developments would result in an additional reserve charge 
variability in our reserve assumptions for long term care may be mitigated by potential future rate increases  particularly those variations associated with long term changes in morbidity or mortality experience as well as investment yields 
when modeled in the aggregate  downside scenarios based on reasonably possible adverse variations in each of our reserve assumptions  including the potential impact of future rate increases on expected future premiums we will receive  could require a reserve increase of percent  or approximately million 
we believe that these ranges provide a reasonable estimate of the possible changes in reserve balances for those product lines where we believe it is possible that variability in the assumptions  in the aggregate  could result in a material impact on our reserve levels  but we record our reserves based on our long term best estimate 
because these product lines have long term claim payout periods  there is a greater potential for significant variability in claim costs  either positive or negative 
deferred acquisition costs dac we defer certain costs incurred in acquiring new business and amortize expense these costs over the life of the related policies 
deferred costs include certain commissions  other agency compensation  selection and policy issue expenses  and field expenses 
acquisition costs that do not vary with the production of new business  such as commissions on group products which are generally level throughout the life of the policy  are excluded from deferral 
approximately percent of our dac relates to traditional non interest sensitive products  and we amortize dac in proportion to the premium income we expect to receive over the life of the policies 
key assumptions used in developing the future amortization of dac are future persistency and future premium income 
we use our own historical experience and expectation of the future performance of our businesses in determining the expected persistency and premium income 
the estimated premium income in the early years of the amortization period is generally higher than in the later years due to the anticipated cumulative effect of policy persistency in the early years  which results in a greater proportion of the costs being amortized in the early years of the life of the policy 
during  our key assumptions used to develop the future amortization of acquisition costs deferred during did not change materially from those used in generally  we do not expect our persistency or interest rates to change significantly in the short term  and to the extent that these trends do change  we expect those changes to be gradual over a longer period of time 
the following are our current assumptions regarding the length of our amortization periods  the approximate dac balance that remains at the end of years   and as a percentage of the cost initially deferred  and our dac balances as of december  and balance remaining as a dac balances amortization of initial deferral at december period year year year unum us group disability group life and accidental death dismemberment to supplemental and voluntary individual disability recently issued voluntary benefits to unum uk group disability group life supplemental and voluntary colonial life accident  sickness  and disability life cancer and critical illness closed block long term care totals amortization of dac on traditional products is adjusted to reflect the actual policy persistency as compared to the anticipated experience  and as a result  the unamortized balance of dac reflects actual persistency 
we may experience accelerated amortization if policies terminate earlier than projected 
conversely  we may also experience longer amortization periods if policies terminate later than projected 
because our actual experience regarding persistency and premium income has varied very little from our assumptions during the last three years  we have had minimal adjustments to our projected amortization of dac during those years 
we measure the recoverability of dac by performing loss recognition tests in the fourth quarter of each year  but more frequently if appropriate  using best estimate assumptions as of the date of the test 
insurance contracts are grouped for each major product line within a segment when we perform loss recognition tests 
if loss recognition testing indicates that dac is not recoverable  the deficiency is charged to expense 
our testing during the fourth quarter of indicated impairment of our long term care dac  and the balance of million as of december  was charged to expense 
our testing indicates that our remaining dac balance as of december  is recoverable 
see long term care strategic review contained in this item for further discussion 
in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standards update  now included in accounting standards codification financial services insurance  to address diversity in practice regarding the interpretation of which costs relating to the acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts qualify as deferred acquisition costs 
the amendments in the update modify the existing guidance and require that only incremental direct costs associated with the successful acquisition of a new or renewal insurance contract can be capitalized 
all other costs are to be expensed as incurred 
the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning after december   and permit retrospective application 
our retrospective adoption of this standard during the first quarter of is expected to result in a cumulative effect decrease in stockholders equity as of january    and of approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
net income restated as a result of the retrospective adoption is expected to decrease million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively  excluding the impact of this adoption on the long term care dac impairment which occurred as of december  a portion of the long term care dac will be written off as of the beginning of the earliest period presented  and as such  the remaining balance to be impaired  subsequent to adoption of this update  will equal million before tax as of december  the adjustment to this previously reported impairment charge is expected to increase net income million in  resulting in a net increase of million on a restated basis for the year ended december  the adoption of this update will result in a decrease in the level of costs we defer and is expected to result in an immaterial decrease in net income in see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item valuation of investments all of our fixed maturity securities are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value 
our derivative financial instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  are reported as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value 
we hold an immaterial amount of equity securities  which are also reported at fair value 
definition of fair value fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and  therefore  represents an exit price  not an entry price 
the exit price objective applies regardless of a reporting entity s intent and or ability to sell the asset or transfer the liability at the measurement date 
the degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability 
financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and less judgment utilized in measuring fair value 
an active market for a financial instrument is a market in which transactions for an asset or a similar asset occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis 
a quoted price in an active market provides the most reliable evidence of fair value and should be used to measure fair value whenever available 
conversely  financial instruments rarely traded or not quoted have less observability and are measured at fair value using valuation techniques that require more judgment 
pricing observability is generally impacted by a number of factors  including the type of financial instrument  whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established  the characteristics specific to the transaction  and overall market conditions 
valuation techniques valuation techniques used for assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value are generally categorized into three types the market approach uses prices and other relevant information from market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities 
valuation techniques consistent with the market approach often use market multiples derived from a set of comparables or matrix pricing 
market multiples might lie in ranges with a different multiple for each comparable 
the selection of where within the range the appropriate multiple falls requires judgment  considering both quantitative and qualitative factors specific to the measurement 
matrix pricing is a mathematical technique used principally to value certain securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but comparing the securities to benchmark or comparable securities 
the income approach converts future amounts  such as cash flows or earnings  to a single present amount  or a discounted amount 
income approach techniques rely on current market expectations of future amounts 
examples of income approach valuation techniques include present value techniques  option pricing models that incorporate present value techniques  and the multi period excess earnings method 
the cost approach is based upon the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset  or the current replacement cost 
that is  from the perspective of a market participant seller  the price that would be received for the asset is determined based on the cost to a market participant buyer to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility 
we use valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available that can be obtained without undue cost and effort 
in some cases  a single valuation technique will be appropriate for example  when valuing an asset or liability using quoted prices in an active market for identical assets or liabilities 
in other cases  multiple valuation techniques will be appropriate 
if we use multiple valuation techniques to measure fair value  we evaluate and weigh the results  as appropriate  considering the reasonableness of the range indicated by those results 
a fair value measurement is the point within that range that is most representative of fair value in the circumstances 
the selection of the valuation method s to apply considers the definition of an exit price and depends on the nature of the asset or liability being valued 
for assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value  we generally use valuation techniques consistent with the market approach  and to a lesser extent  the income approach 
we believe the market approach valuation technique provides more observable data than the income approach  considering the type of investments we hold 
the market sources from which we obtain or derive the fair values of our assets and liabilities carried at market value include quoted market prices for actual trades  price quotes from third party pricing vendors  price quotes we obtain from outside brokers  matrix pricing  discounted cash flow  and observable prices for similar publicly traded or privately traded issues that incorporate the credit quality and industry sector of the issuer 
our fair value measurements could differ significantly based on the valuation technique and available inputs 
when using a pricing service  we obtain the vendor s pricing methodology documentation to ensure we understand their methodologies 
we periodically review and approve the selection of the pricing vendors we use to ensure we are in agreement with their methodologies 
we also review the reasonableness of sources and inputs used in developing pricing 
when markets are less active  brokers may rely more on models with inputs based on the information available only to the broker 
we monitor securities priced by brokers and evaluate their prices for reasonableness based on benchmarking to available primary and secondary market information 
in weighing a broker quote as an input to fair value  we place less reliance on quotes that do not reflect the result of market transactions 
we also consider the nature of the quote  particularly whether the quote is a binding offer 
if prices in an inactive market do not reflect current prices for the same or similar assets  adjustments may be necessary to arrive at fair value 
when relevant market data is unavailable  which may be the case during periods of market uncertainty  the income approach can  in suitable circumstances  provide a more appropriate fair value 
during  we have applied valuation techniques on a consistent basis to similar assets and liabilities and consistent with those techniques used at year end inputs to valuation techniques inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants use in pricing assets or liabilities  including assumptions about risk  for example  the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique used to measure fair value such as a pricing model and or the risk inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique 
we use observable and unobservable inputs in measuring the fair value of our financial instruments 
observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from independent sources 
unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances 
inputs that may be used include the following broker market maker prices and price levels trade reporting and compliance engine trace pricing prices obtained from external pricing services benchmark yields treasury and interest rate swap curves transactional data for new issuance and secondary trades security cash flows and structures recent issuance supply sector and issuer level spreads security credit ratings maturity capital structure optionality corporate actions underlying collateral prepayment speeds loan performance delinquencies weighted average life seasoning public covenants comparative bond analysis derivative spreads relevant reports issued by analysts and rating agencies audited financial statements we review all prices obtained to ensure they are consistent with a variety of observable market inputs and to verify the validity of a security s price 
in the event we receive a vendor s market price that does not appear reasonable based on our market analysis  we may challenge the price and request further information about the assumptions and methodologies used by the vendor to price the security 
we may change the vendor price based on a better data source such as an actual trade 
we also review all price changes from the prior month which fall outside a predetermined corridor 
the overall valuation process for determining fair values may include adjustments to valuations obtained from our pricing sources when they do not represent a valid exit price 
these adjustments may be made when  in our judgment and considering our knowledge of the financial conditions and industry in which the issuer operates  certain features of the financial instrument require that an adjustment be made to the value originally obtained from our pricing sources 
these features may include the complexity of the financial instrument  the market in which the financial instrument is traded  counterparty credit risk  credit structure  concentration  or liquidity 
additionally  an adjustment to the price derived from a model typically reflects our judgment of the inputs that other participants in the market for the financial instrument being measured at fair value would consider in pricing that same financial instrument 
in the event that we sell an asset  we test the validity of the fair value determined by our valuation techniques by comparing the selling price to the fair value determined for the asset in the immediately preceding reporting period or prior month end closest to the transaction date 
historically  our realized gain or loss on disposition of an investment is consistent with the assumptions under the valuation methodologies described above  which  combined with the results of our testing  indicates to us that our pricing methodologies are appropriate 
the parameters and inputs used to validate a price on a security may be adjusted for assumptions about risk and current market conditions on a quarter to quarter basis  as certain features may be more significant drivers of valuation at the time of pricing 
changes to inputs in valuations are not changes to valuation methodologies  rather  the inputs are modified to reflect direct or indirect impacts on asset classes from changes in market conditions 
fair values for derivatives other than embedded derivatives in modified coinsurance arrangements are based on market quotes or pricing models and represent the net amount of cash we would have paid or received if the contracts had been settled or closed as of the last day of the period 
we analyze credit default swap spreads relative to the average credit spread embedded within the london interbank offered rate libor setting syndicate in determining the effect of credit risk on our derivatives fair values 
if counterparty credit risk for a derivative asset is determined to be material and is not adequately reflected in the libor based fair value obtained from our pricing sources  we adjust the valuations obtained from our pricing sources 
in regard to our own credit risk component  we adjust the valuation of derivative liabilities wherein the counterparty is exposed to our credit risk when the libor based valuation of our derivatives obtained from pricing sources does not effectively include an adequate credit component for our own credit risk 
fair values for our embedded derivative in a modified coinsurance arrangement are estimated using internal pricing models and represent the hypothetical value of the duration mismatch of assets and liabilities  interest rate risk  and third party credit risk embedded in the modified coinsurance arrangement 
certain of our investments do not have readily determinable market prices and or observable inputs or may at times be affected by the lack of market liquidity 
for these securities  we use internally prepared valuations combining matrix pricing with vendor purchased software programs  including valuations based on estimates of future profitability  to estimate the fair value 
additionally  we may obtain prices from independent third party brokers to aid in establishing valuations for certain of these securities 
key assumptions used by us to determine fair value for these securities include risk free interest rates  risk premiums  performance of underlying collateral if any  and other factors involving significant assumptions which may or may not reflect those of an active market 
as of december   the key assumptions we generally used to estimate the fair value of these types of securities included those listed below 
where appropriate  we have noted the assumption used for the prior period as well as the reason for the change 
risk free interest rates of percent for five year maturities to percent for year maturities were derived from the current yield curve for us treasury bonds with similar maturities 
this compares to interest rates of percent for five year maturities to percent for year maturities used at december  current baa corporate bond spreads ranging from percent to percent were added to the risk free rate to reflect the lack of liquidity 
we used spreads ranging from percent to percent at december  the changes were based on observable market spreads 
newly issued private placement securities have historically offered yield premiums higher than a similar interest rate spread on comparable newly issued public securities 
additional basis points were added as deemed appropriate for foreign investments  certain industries  and individual securities in certain industries that are considered to be of greater risk 
at december   approximately percent of our fixed maturity securities were valued using active trades from trace pricing or broker market maker prices for which there was current market activity in that specific security comparable to receiving one binding quote 
the prices obtained were not adjusted  and the assets were classified as level  the highest category of the three level fair value hierarchy classification wherein inputs are unadjusted and represent quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
the remaining percent of our fixed maturity securities were valued based on non binding quotes or other observable and unobservable inputs  as discussed below 
approximately percent of our fixed maturity securities were valued based on prices from pricing services that generally use observable inputs such as prices for securities or comparable securities in active markets in their valuation techniques 
these assets were classified as level level assets or liabilities are those valued using inputs other than prices included in level that are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the measurement date and for the duration of the instrument s anticipated life 
approximately percent of our fixed maturity securities were valued based on one or more non binding broker price levels  if validated by observable market data  or on trace prices for identical or similar assets absent current market activity 
when only one price is available  it is used if observable inputs and analysis confirms that it is appropriate 
these assets  for which we were able to validate the price using other observable market data  were classified as level approximately percent of our fixed maturity securities were valued based on prices of comparable securities  matrix pricing  market models  and or internal models or were valued based on non binding quotes with no other observable market data 
these assets were classified as either level or level  with the categorization dependent on whether there was other observable market data 
level is the lowest category of the fair value hierarchy and reflects the judgment of management regarding what market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities at the measurement date 
financial assets and liabilities categorized as level are generally those that are valued using unobservable inputs to extrapolate an estimated fair value 
we consider transactions in inactive or disorderly markets to be less representative of fair value 
we use all available observable inputs when measuring fair value  but when significant other unobservable inputs and adjustments are necessary  we classify these assets or liabilities as level as of december   approximately percent of our fixed maturity securities were categorized as level  percent as level  and percent as level during  we transferred million of fixed maturity securities into level and million of fixed maturity securities out of level the transfers between levels resulted primarily from a change in observability of three inputs used to determine fair values of the securities transferred transactional data for new issuance and secondary trades  broker dealer quotes and pricing  primarily related to changes in the level of activity in the market and whether the market was considered orderly  and comparable bond metrics from which to perform an analysis 
for fair value measurements of financial instruments that were transferred either into or out of level  we reflect the transfers using the fair value at the beginning of the period 
we believe this allows for greater transparency as all changes in fair value that arise during the reporting period of the transfer are disclosed as a component of our level reconciliation as shown in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item other than temporary impairment analysis for investments in determining when a decline in fair value below amortized cost of a fixed maturity security is other than temporary  we evaluate the following factors whether we expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security whether we intend to sell the security or will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis whether the security is current as to principal and interest payments the significance of the decline in value the time period during which there has been a significant decline in value current and future business prospects and trends of earnings the valuation of the security s underlying collateral relevant industry conditions and trends relative to their historical cycles market conditions rating agency and governmental actions bid and offering prices and the level of trading activity adverse changes in estimated cash flows for securitized investments changes in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date any other key measures for the related security 
we evaluate available information  including the factors noted above  both positive and negative  in reaching our conclusions 
in particular  we also consider the strength of the issuer s balance sheet  its debt obligations and near term funding requirements  cash flow and liquidity  the profitability of its core businesses  the availability of marketable assets which could be sold to increase liquidity  its industry fundamentals and regulatory environment  and its access to capital markets 
although all available and applicable factors are considered in our analysis  our expectation of recovering the entire amortized cost basis of the security  whether we intend to sell the security  whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost  and whether the security is current on principal and interest payments are the most critical factors in determining whether impairments are other than temporary 
the significance of the decline in value and the length of time during which there has been a significant decline are also important factors  but we generally do not record an impairment loss based solely on these two factors  since often other more relevant factors will impact our evaluation of a security 
while determining other than temporary impairments is a judgmental area  we utilize a formal  well defined  and disciplined process to monitor and evaluate our fixed income investment portfolio  supported by issuer specific research and documentation as of the end of each period 
the process results in a thorough evaluation of problem investments and the recording of losses on a timely basis for investments determined to have an other than temporary impairment 
if we determine that the decline in value of an investment is other than temporary  the investment is written down to fair value  and an impairment loss is recognized in the current period  either in earnings or in both earnings and other comprehensive income  as applicable 
for those fixed maturity securities with an unrealized loss for which we have not recognized an other than temporary impairment  we believe we will recover the entire amortized cost  we do not intend to sell the security  and we do not believe it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost 
there have been no defaults in the repayment obligations of any securities for which we have not recorded an other than temporary impairment 
other than temporary impairment losses on fixed maturity securities which we intend to sell or more likely than not will be required to sell before recovery in value are recognized in earnings and equal the entire difference between the security s amortized cost basis and its fair value 
for securities which we do not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell before recovery in value  other than temporary impairment losses recognized in earnings generally represent the difference between the amortized cost of the security and the present value of our best estimate of cash flows expected to be collected  discounted using the effective interest rate implicit in the security at the date of acquisition 
the determination of cash flows is inherently subjective  and methodologies may vary depending on the circumstances specific to the security 
the timing and amount of our cash flow estimates are developed using historical and forecast financial information from the issuer  including its current and projected liquidity position 
we also consider industry analyst reports and forecasts  sector credit ratings  future business prospects and earnings trends  issuer refinancing capabilities  actual and or potential asset sales by the issuer  and other data relevant to the collectibility of the contractual cash flows of the security 
we take into account the probability of default  expected recoveries  third party guarantees  quality of collateral  and where our debt security ranks in terms of subordination 
we may use the estimated fair value of collateral as a proxy for the present value of cash flows if we believe the security is dependent on the liquidation of collateral for recovery of our investment 
for fixed maturity securities for which we have recognized an other than temporary impairment loss through earnings  if through subsequent evaluation there is a significant increase in expected cash flows  the difference between the new amortized cost basis and the cash flows expected to be collected is accreted as net investment income 
we use a comprehensive rating system to evaluate the investment and credit risk of our mortgage loans and to identify specific properties for inspection and reevaluation 
mortgage loans are considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
we establish an allowance for probable losses on mortgage loans based on a review of individual loans  considering the value of the underlying collateral 
mortgage loans are not reported at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets unless the mortgage loan is considered impaired  in which case the impairment is recognized as a realized investment loss in our consolidated statements of income 
there are a number of significant risks inherent in the process of monitoring our investments for impairments and determining when and if an impairment is other than temporary 
these risks and uncertainties include the following possibilities the assessment of a borrower s ability to meet its contractual obligations will change 
the economic outlook  either domestic or foreign  may be less favorable or may have a more significant impact on the borrower than anticipated  and as such  the investment may not recover in value 
new information may become available concerning the security  such as disclosure of accounting irregularities  fraud  or corporate governance issues 
significant changes in credit spreads may occur in the related industry 
significant increases in interest rates may occur and may not return to levels similar to when securities were initially purchased 
adverse rating agency actions may occur 
pension and postretirement benefit plans we sponsor several defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit opeb plans for our employees  including non qualified pension plans 
the us pension plans comprise the majority of our total benefit obligation and pension expense 
our uk operation maintains a separate defined benefit plan for eligible employees 
the uk defined benefit pension plan was closed to new entrants on december  our net periodic benefit costs and the value of our benefit obligations for these plans are determined based on a set of economic and demographic assumptions that represent our best estimate of future expected experience 
major assumptions used in accounting for these plans include the expected discount interest rate and the long term rate of return on plan assets 
we also use  as applicable  expected increases in compensation levels and a weighted average annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits  which reflects a health care cost trend rate  and the uk pension plan also uses expected cost of living increases to plan benefits 
the assumptions chosen for our pension and opeb plans are reviewed annually  using a december measurement date for each of our plans 
the discount rate assumptions and expected long term rate of return assumptions have the most significant effect on our net periodic benefit costs associated with these plans 
in addition to the effect of changes in our assumptions  the net periodic cost or benefit obligation under our pension and opeb plans may change due to factors such as actual experience being different from our assumptions  special benefits to terminated employees  or changes in benefits provided under the plans 
discount rate assumptions the discount rate is an interest assumption used to convert the benefit payment stream to a present value 
we set the discount rate assumption at the measurement date for each of our retirement related benefit plans to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality fixed income debt instruments matched against the timing and amounts of projected future benefits 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases our costs 
the discount rate we used to determine our and net periodic benefit costs for our us pension plans was percent and percent  respectively 
the discount rate used for the net periodic benefit costs for and for our uk pension plan was percent and percent  respectively 
the discount rate used in the net periodic benefit cost for our opeb plan for and was percent and percent  respectively 
reducing the discount rate assumption by basis points would have resulted in an increase in our pension expense of approximately million  before tax  and an increase in our benefit obligation of approximately million as of december   resulting in an after tax decrease in stockholders equity of approximately million as of december  a basis point reduction in the discount rate assumption would not change our annual opeb costs 
increasing the discount rate assumption by basis points would have resulted in a decrease in our pension expense of approximately million  before tax  and a decrease in our benefit obligation of approximately million as of december   resulting in an after tax increase in stockholders equity of approximately million as of december  a basis point increase in the discount rate assumption would not change our annual opeb costs 
long term rate of return assumptions the long term rate of return assumption is the best estimate of the average annual assumed return that will be produced from the pension trust assets until current benefits are paid 
the us pension plans use a compound interest method in computing the rate of return on their pension plan assets 
the investment portfolio for our us qualified pension plan contains a diversified blend of domestic and international large cap  mid cap  and small cap equity securities  us government and agency and corporate fixed income securities  private equity funds of funds  and hedge funds of funds 
assets for our uk pension plan are invested in pooled funds  including a diversified growth fund  which invests in assets such as global equities  hedge funds  commodities  below investment grade fixed income securities  and currencies  as well as leveraged  interest rate  and inflation swap funds intended to broadly match part of the interest rate and inflation sensitivities of the plan s liabilities 
assets for our opeb plan are invested primarily in life insurance contracts 
we believe our investment portfolios are well diversified by asset class and sector  with no potential risk concentrations in any one category 
our expectations for the future investment returns of the asset categories are based on a combination of historical market performance  evaluations of investment forecasts obtained from external consultants and economists  and current market yields 
for the us pension plans  the methodology underlying the return assumption included the various elements of the expected return for each asset class such as long term rates of return  volatility of returns  and the correlation of returns between various asset classes 
the expected return for the total portfolio is calculated based on the plan s current asset allocation 
investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements  periodic asset liability studies  and quarterly investment portfolio reviews 
risk tolerance is established through consideration of plan liabilities  plan funded status  and corporate financial condition 
in  we changed the investment strategy for our uk pension plan  which resulted in new investment classes as well as a new target allocation for the plan s assets 
at december   the uk pension plan s target allocation was percent equity securities and percent fixed income securities 
in  we changed the plan s target allocation for the assets to percent diversified growth assets and percent interest rate and inflation swap funds 
the new investment classes and new target allocation resulted in lower yields and lower expected returns on the plan s assets 
we expect that our pension costs will be higher than our pension costs in due primarily to the lower yields on the uk plan s investments 
this change in investment strategy will not have an impact on our ability to fund this plan 
the long term rate of return on asset assumption used in the net periodic pension costs for our us qualified defined benefit pension plan for and was percent for both years 
the long term rate of return on asset assumption used for and for our uk pension plan was percent and percent  respectively  and for our opeb plan  percent for both years 
the actual rate of return on plan assets is determined based on the fair value of the plan assets at the beginning and the end of the period  adjusted for contributions and benefit payments 
changing the expected long term rate of return on the plan assets by basis points would have changed our pension plan expense by approximately million before tax  but our opeb plan expense would not change 
a lower rate of return on plan assets increases our expense 
benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets the market related value equals the fair value of assets  determined as of the measurement date 
the return on assets fully recognizes all asset gains and losses  including changes in fair value  through the measurement date 
during  the fair value of plan assets in our us qualified defined benefit pension plan decreased million  or approximately percent  while the fair value of plan assets in our uk pension plan increased million  or approximately percent 
although the effect of these changes in fair value had no impact on our net periodic pension costs  the unfavorable rate of return on the us plan assets in will have an unfavorable impact on our net periodic pension costs for we expect that our pension costs for the us qualified defined benefit pension plan will be higher than our pension costs in due to asset underperformance and a decrease in the discount rate 
the favorable rate of return on the uk plan assets in will have a favorable impact on our net periodic pension costs for however  we expect that our uk pension plan costs will be higher than in due to a reduction in the expected return on plan assets resulting from lower yields  as previously discussed 
we believe our assumptions appropriately reflect the impact of the current economic environment 
our pension and opeb plans have an aggregate unrecognized net actuarial loss of million and an unrecognized prior service credit of million  which together represent the cumulative liability and asset gains and losses as well as the portion of prior service credits that have not been recognized in pension expense 
as of december   the unrecognized net loss for these two items combined was approximately million 
the unrecognized gains or losses are amortized as a component of the net benefit cost 
our   and pension and opeb expense includes million  million  and million  respectively  of amortization of the unrecognized net actuarial gain loss and prior service credit cost 
the unrecognized net actuarial loss for our pension plans  which is million at december   will be amortized over the average future working life of pension plan participants  currently estimated at years for us participants and years for uk participants  to the extent that it exceeds the percent corridor  as described below 
the unrecognized net actuarial loss of million for our opeb plan will be amortized over the average future working life of opeb plan participants  currently estimated at years  to the extent the loss is outside of a corridor established in accordance with gaap 
the corridor for the pension and opeb plans is established based on the greater of percent of the plan assets or percent of the benefit obligation 
at december   million of the actuarial loss was outside of the corridor for the us plan and million was outside of the corridor for the uk plan 
at december   none of the actuarial loss was outside of the corridor for the opeb plan 
the fair value of plan assets in our us qualified defined benefit pension plan was  million at december   compared to  million at december  the effect of a reduction in the liability discount rate  together with the decrease in fair value of plan assets  increased our year end deficit funding level to million at december   compared to a deficit of million as of december  the fair value of plan assets in our opeb plan was million at december   compared to million at december  these assets represent life insurance contracts to fund the life insurance benefit portion of our opeb plan 
our opeb plan represents a non vested  non guaranteed obligation  and current regulations do not require specific funding levels for these benefits  which are comprised of retiree life  medical  and dental benefits 
it is our practice to use general assets to pay medical and dental claims as they come due in lieu of utilizing plan assets for the medical and dental benefit portions of our opeb plan 
we expect to continue to receive subsidies under the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  based on current law  to partially offset these payments 
the expected subsidy included in our consolidated balance sheets is immaterial 
our expected return on plan assets and discount rate discussed above will not affect the cash contributions we are required to make to our us pension and opeb plans because we have met all minimum funding requirements set forth by erisa 
we had no regulatory contribution requirements for and  however  we elected to make voluntary contributions of million in to our us qualified defined benefit pension plan 
we made no pension contributions to our us qualified defined benefit pension plan during  but we expect to make a contribution of approximately million in during  the us federal government enacted the pension protection act of which requires companies to fully fund defined benefit pension plans over a seven year period 
we have evaluated this requirement and have made estimates of amounts to be funded in the future 
based on this assessment  we do not believe that the funding requirements of the pension protection act will cause a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
the fair value of plan assets for our uk pension plan was million at december   compared to million at december  the uk pension plan had a surplus of million and million at december  and  respectively 
we contribute to the plan in accordance with a schedule of contributions which requires that we contribute to the plan at the rate of at least percent of pensionable salaries for active members of the plan  plus percent of pensionable salaries for all employees including active members of the plan who are entitled to lump sum death in service benefits under the plan  sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirement under uk legislation 
during and  we made required contributions of million and million  respectively 
we expect to make contributions of approximately million during see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item for further discussion 
income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
as of december   we had no net operating loss carryforward pertaining to our us operations 
in  as part of an irs settlement  we released the million valuation allowance related to basis differences in foreign subsidiaries and net operating loss carryforwards in foreign jurisdictions for which we previously believed we would not realize a tax benefit 
in evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets  we have considered all available positive and negative evidence including past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
in the event we determine that we most likely would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an increase to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
likewise  if it is later determined that it is more likely than not that those deferred tax assets would be realized  the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws in a multitude of jurisdictions  both domestic and foreign 
the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions  and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect profitability 
gaap prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns 
the evaluation of a tax position is a two step process 
the first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position 
the second step is to measure a position that satisfies the recognition threshold at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not threshold but that now satisfy the recognition threshold are recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met 
previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met 
if a previously recognized tax position is settled for an amount that is different from the amount initially measured  the difference will be recognized as a tax benefit or expense in the period the settlement is effective 
we believe that tax positions have been reflected in our financial statements at appropriate amounts in conformity with gaap 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item contingent liabilities on a quarterly basis  we review relevant information with respect to litigation and contingencies to be reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
an estimated loss is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated

see reconciliation of non gaap financial measures as follows for additional discussion of these items 
the comparability of our financial results between years is affected by the fluctuation in the british pound sterling to dollar exchange rate 
the functional currency of our uk operations is the british pound sterling 
in periods when the pound weakens  translating pounds into dollars decreases current period results relative to the prior period 
in periods when the pound strengthens  translating pounds into dollars increases current period results in relation to the prior period 
our weighted average pound dollar exchange rate was   and for the years ended   and  respectively 
if the and results for our uk operations had been translated at the higher exchange rate of  our operating revenue by segment in and would have been higher by approximately million and million  respectively  and operating income by segment in and would have been higher by approximately million and million  respectively 
however  it is important to distinguish between translating and converting foreign currency 
except for a limited number of transactions  we do not actually convert pounds into dollars 
as a result  we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting item and not a reflection of operations or profitability in the uk consolidated premium income for both and includes premium growth  relative to the preceding years  for our unum us group life and accidental death and dismemberment and voluntary benefits lines of business as well as for colonial life 
our unum us group disability line of business experienced declines in premium income during both and relative to prior years due primarily to the ongoing high levels of unemployment and the competitive environment which impact sales growth and premium growth from existing customers 
in particular  premium growth from existing customers continues to be unfavorably impacted by lower salary growth and lower growth in the number of employees covered under an existing policy 
premium income for unum us individual disability recently issued increased in and decreased in relative to prior years due primarily to the volume of sales 
unum uk premium income  in local currency  increased in but declined in relative to the prior year periods 
premium growth in unum uk continues to be pressured by pricing actions resulting from the competitive uk market 
premium income for our individual disability closed block of business continued its expected decline in both and our long term care closed block of business experienced premium growth in both and relative to prior years due to higher persistency and group long term care sales 
net investment income was higher in relative to due primarily to continued growth in the level of invested assets and higher bond call premiums  partially offset by an increase in the amortization of the principal amount invested in our tax credit partnerships due to the higher level of investment in this asset class  a decrease in income on other partnership investments  and a decline in the level of prepayment income on mortgage backed securities 
net investment income was higher in relative to due primarily to growth in the level of invested assets and higher bond call premiums 
we also received higher interest income during on bonds for which interest income is linked to a uk inflation index 
we invest in index linked bonds to support the claim reserves associated with unum uk group policies that provide for inflation linked increases in benefits 
although over the intermediate term the investment return from index linked bonds generally matches the index linked claim payments and reserves  the effect on investment income from the inflation index linked bonds may not be completely offset by a similar change in claim payments and reserves in each quarterly or annual period 
we recognized in earnings a net realized investment loss of million in compared to gains of million and million in and  respectively 
included in these amounts were other than temporary impairment losses on fixed maturity securities of million  million  and million in   and  respectively  all of which were recognized in earnings other than a loss of million in which was recognized in other comprehensive income 
also recognized in earnings through realized investment gains and losses was the change in the fair value of an embedded derivative in a modified coinsurance arrangement 
changes in the fair value of this embedded derivative resulted in a realized loss of million in compared to realized gains of million and million in and  respectively 
gains and losses on this embedded derivative result primarily from changes in credit spreads in the overall investment market 
the reported benefit ratio was percent in excluding the reserve charges for our long term care and individual disability closed blocks of business  the benefit ratio was percent in  compared to percent and percent in and  respectively  with unfavorable year over year risk results in our unum uk and colonial life segments partially offset by favorable risk results in our unum us segment 
further discussion of our line of business risk results and claims management performance for each of our segments is included in segment results as follows 
interest and debt expense in was marginally higher than due primarily to the september issuance of million of debt  mostly offset by the maturity of million of debt in march we also experienced lower interest expense in compared to on million of debt which we effectively converted into floating rate debt through the use of an interest rate swap entered into during the fourth quarter of interest and debt expense for was higher than in due to higher levels of outstanding debt  partially offset by lower rates of interest on our floating rate debt issued by northwind holdings and tailwind holdings 
see debt contained in this item for additional information 
the deferral of acquisition costs increased in both and relative to the prior year periods  with continued growth in certain of our product lines and the associated increase in deferrable expenses more than offsetting the lower level of deferrable costs in product lines with lower growth 
the amortization of acquisition costs in was lower than due to a decline in amortization related to internal replacement transactions for our unum us group disability business  lower levels of accelerated amortization related to favorable persistency relative to assumptions for certain issue years in our individual disability recently issued and long term care product lines  as well as favorable mortality experience for certain of our interest sensitive life products 
the amortization of acquisition costs in was slightly higher than the preceding year due to the continued increase in the level of deferred acquisition costs as well as an acceleration of amortization resulting from lower persistency for certain issue years in our individual disability recently issued and long term care product lines 
although the rate of persistency for the overall block of business within these product lines was favorable to  the persistency for certain individual issue years was less than expected and required additional amortization of deferred acquisition costs 
as previously discussed  at december  we determined that our long term care deferred acquisition costs of million were not recoverable  and we recognized an impairment charge at that time 
the year over year variability in compensation expense primarily relates to incentive compensation which varies with the volume of sales 
also impacting the higher compensation expense in were costs related to the implementation of expense management initiatives 
other expenses were slightly lower in compared to the prior year due to our continued focus on operating effectiveness and expense management 
other expenses decreased in compared to due primarily to a decline in our pension costs as well as continued expense management 
in  we recognized a reduction in federal income taxes of million due to a final settlement with the internal revenue service irs with respect to our appeal of audit adjustments for the tax years to also favorably impacting income tax compared to prior years is our increased level of investments in low income housing tax credit partnerships 
our income tax for was unfavorably impacted by an million tax related to the repatriation of million of dividends from our uk subsidiaries 
the income tax rate in the uk is expected to be reduced annually  at least one percent per year  beginning in april  with the ultimate goal of reducing the rate from percent to percent 
in accordance with gaap  we are required to adjust deferred tax assets and liabilities through income on the date of enactment of a rate change  the first of which occurred during the third quarter of an additional rate change was enacted during the third quarter of we recorded a reduction of million and million to our income tax expense during and  respectively  to reflect the impact of the rate changes on our net deferred tax liability related to our uk operations 
in march  legislation related to healthcare reform was signed into law 
among other things  the new legislation reduced the tax benefits available to an employer that receives a postretirement prescription drug coverage subsidy from the federal government under the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of under the new legislation  to the extent our future postretirement prescription drug coverage expenses are reimbursed under the subsidy program  the expenses covered by the subsidy will no longer be tax deductible after employers that receive the subsidy were required to recognize the deferred tax effects relating to the future postretirement prescription drug coverage in the period the legislation was enacted 
our income tax expense for included a non cash tax charge of million which was recorded in the first quarter of to reflect the impact of the tax law change 
reconciliation of non gaap financial measures we analyze our performance using non gaap financial measures 
a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s performance  financial position  or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
we believe operating income or loss which excludes realized investment gains and losses and certain other items listed in our reconciliation is a better performance measure and a better indicator of the profitability and underlying trends in our business 
our investment focus is on investment income to support our insurance liabilities as opposed to the generation of realized investment gains and losses  and a long term focus is necessary to maintain profitability over the life of the business 
realized investment gains and losses depend on market conditions and do not necessarily relate to decisions regarding the underlying business of our segments 
however  income or loss excluding realized investment gains and losses and certain other items does not replace net income or net loss as a measure of overall profitability 
we may experience realized investment losses  which will affect future earnings levels since our underlying business is long term in nature and we need to earn the interest rates assumed in calculating our liabilities 
the non gaap financial measures of operating revenue  operating income or operating loss  and after tax operating income differ from revenue  income loss before income tax  and net income as presented in our consolidated operating results and in income statements prepared in accordance with gaap due to the exclusion of before tax realized investment gains and losses and certain other items 
a reconciliation of operating revenue by segment to revenue and operating income by segment to net income is as follows in millions of dollars year ended december operating revenue by segment net realized investment gain loss revenue operating income by segment net realized investment gain loss income tax net income as previously noted  included in before tax operating income by segment shown in the preceding chart are certain other items which we may at times exclude from our discussion of financial ratios and metrics in order to enhance the understanding and comparability of our operational performance and the underlying fundamentals  but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur 
excluding the before tax charges of million to recognize an impairment of our long term care deferred acquisition costs and million and million to increase reserves in our long term care and individual disability closed blocks  respectively  our operating income by segment is  million for the after tax impacts of these charges  as well as certain other items  are reflected in the following reconciliation of after tax operating income to net income year ended december in millions per share in millions per share in millions per share after tax operating income deferred acquisition costs impairment and reserve charges for long term care closed block reserve charge for individual disability closed block tax reduction from irs settlement tax related to uk repatriation tax related to healthcare reform legislation net realized investment gain loss income tax benefit on net realized investment gain loss net income assuming dilution consolidated sales results as previously discussed  effective with the fourth quarter of  we reclassified our long term care line of business from the unum us segment to the closed block segment 
prior period sales results have been restated to reflect this change in our reporting classifications 
in millions of dollars year ended december change change unum us fully insured products administrative services only aso products total unum us unum uk colonial life closed block consolidated sales results shown in the preceding chart generally represent the annualized premium or annualized fee income on new sales which we expect to receive and report as premium income or fee income during the next months following or beginning in the initial quarter in which the sale is reported  depending on the effective date of the new sale 
sales do not correspond to premium income or fee income reported as revenue in accordance with gaap 
this is because new annualized sales premiums reflect current sales performance and what we expect to recognize as premium or fee income over a month period  while premium income and fee income reported in our financial statements are reported on an as earned basis rather than an annualized basis and also include renewals and persistency of in force policies written in prior years as well as current new sales 
premiums for fully insured products are reported as premium income 
fees for aso and family medical leave products are included in other income 
sales  persistency of the existing block of business  and the effectiveness of a renewal program are indicators of growth in premium and fee income 
trends in new sales  as well as existing market share  also indicate the potential for growth in our respective markets and the level of market acceptance of price changes and new product offerings 
sales results may fluctuate significantly due to case size and timing of sales submissions 
we experienced lower sales growth from some of our product lines during and the two preceding years which we believe is mostly attributable to the economic environment 
we expect this unfavorable pattern may continue in the near term if current economic conditions persist 
see segment results as follows for additional discussion of sales by segment 
segment results our reporting segments are comprised of the following unum us  unum uk  colonial life  closed block  and corporate 
in conjunction with our long term care strategic review  effective with the fourth quarter of we modified our reporting segments to reclassify our long term care products from the unum us segment to the closed block segment 
we also reclassified our other insurance products not actively marketed  including individual life and corporate owned life insurance  reinsurance pools and management operations  group pension  health insurance  and individual annuities  which were previously reported in the corporate and other segment to the closed block segment 
the inclusion of all closed blocks of business into one operating segment aligns with our reporting and monitoring of our closed blocks of business within a discrete segment and is consistent with our separation of these blocks of business from the lines of business which actively market new products 
prior period segment results have been restated to reflect this change in our reporting classifications 
financial information for each of the reporting segments is as follows 
unum us segment the unum us segment includes group long term and short term disability insurance  group life and accidental death and dismemberment products  and supplemental and voluntary lines of business  which are comprised of individual disability recently issued insurance and voluntary benefits products 
as previously noted  effective with the fourth quarter of  we reclassified our long term care products from the unum us segment to the closed block segment

the number of new accounts added in our group core market segment during was percent higher than the number of new accounts added during sales in our group large case market segment were percent higher in compared to due to higher group long term disability and group life sales  partially offset by lower group short term disability and accidental  death  and dismemberment sales

the number of new accounts added in the voluntary benefits product line was percent higher in than the number of new accounts added during sales in our individual disability recently issued line of business  which are primarily concentrated in the multi life market  were percent higher in compared to the year over year increase was primarily due to strong sales in our larger sized markets  as well as the unusually low volume of sales we experienced during for this line of business 
we believe that the group core market and voluntary benefits market  which combined together are approximately percent of our unum us sales for and grew approximately percent relative to  represent significant growth opportunities 
we will also seek disciplined and opportunistic growth  generally at the market growth rate  in the group large case and individual disability markets 
while in the short term we expect economic trends to continue to pressure sales growth  we believe we are well positioned for economic recovery 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  unum us sales in were negatively impacted by economic conditions and the competitive environment  as sales declined percent in relative to sales in our group core market segment decreased percent in compared to  with lower group long term and short term disability sales and lower group life and accidental death and dismemberment sales

sales of voluntary benefits increased percent in relative to  and the number of new accounts increased percent 
sales in our individual disability recently issued line of business decreased percent in compared to segment outlook although we experienced premium and sales growth during  we believe that premium and sales growth  particularly growth in existing customer accounts  will continue to be pressured by ongoing high levels of unemployment and the competitive environment 
opportunities for premium and sales growth are expected to re emerge as the economy improves and employment growth resumes 
we expect some volatility in net investment income to continue as a result of fluctuations in bond calls and other types of miscellaneous net investment income 
we intend to continue to manage our expense levels relative to premium levels through operating effectiveness and performance management 
certain risks and uncertainties are inherent in the disability insurance business 
components of claims experience  such as incidence and recovery rates  may be worse than we expect 
disability claim incidence and claim recovery rates may be influenced by  among other factors  the rate of unemployment and consumer confidence 
within the group disability market  pricing and renewal actions can be taken to react to higher claim rates  but these actions take time to implement  and there is a risk that the market will not sustain increased prices 
in addition  changes in economic and external conditions may not manifest themselves in claims experience for an extended period of time 
the current economic conditions may lead to a higher rate of claim incidence  lower levels of claim recoveries  or lower claim discount rates 
we have previously taken steps to improve our risk profile  including reducing our exposure to volatile business segments through diversification by market size  product segment  and industry segment 
we believe our claims management organization is positioned for stable and sustainable performance levels 
we are uncertain as to whether the higher claim incidence experienced in was due to the normal volatility that occurs in our group disability business or was related to the economy 
as a result of the continued decline in interest rates  during  we lowered our claim discount rate for new claim incurrals in group disability 
we are initiating price increases for our group disability products during as a result of higher claim incidence and the lower claim discount rate 
we continuously monitor key indicators to assess our risks and attempt to adjust our business plans accordingly 
we believe our unum us growth strategy is sound and that we will be able to leverage the capabilities  products  and relationships and reputation we have built to deliver growth as the benefits market stabilizes 
we continue to see future growth opportunity based on employee choice  defined employer funding  superior service  and effective communication 
we intend to maintain our discipline and will continue i directing the majority of our efforts on capturing opportunities emerging in our core group and voluntary markets to grow them at above market rates  ii focusing on margins in large case group insurance  while leveraging core market  voluntary  and other shorter term investments to grow at market rates  and iii seeking opportunities to improve margins and return in our supplemental lines of business 
we believe we are well positioned strategically in our markets and that opportunities for continued disciplined growth exist in our group core market segment and in the voluntary markets 
while the current economic conditions have impacted our ability to grow premium income and will continue to do so until we return to a more normal economic environment  we expect to achieve marginal year over year growth in our premium income during we anticipate that the benefit ratio in our group disability product line will be generally consistent with the levels of and  depending on claim incidence rates and claim discount rates 
we think future profit margin improvement is achievable  driven primarily by our continued product mix shift and expense efficiencies as our claims performance gradually flattens 
we began offering group dental benefits through a partnership with united concordia  beginning with an initial launch in a selected market during the fourth quarter of  with additional markets expected to be added throughout the product offering will include flexible plan designs aligned with our other employer sponsored benefit coverages and will be targeted to the group core market segment

these declines were partially offset by higher sales to existing customers 
sales in the supplemental and voluntary line of business decreased in compared to sales in unum uk decreased slightly in compared to  with the decrease in sales in the group long term disability line of business being attributable to a decline in sales in the large case market  partially offset by higher sales to existing customers and higher core market sales 
the sales growth in group life was attributable to higher sales in the large case markets as well as higher sales to existing customers  partially offset by slightly lower core market sales 
the decrease in sales in supplemental and voluntary was due to a decline in sales in the large case market 
negatively affecting year over year comparisons is an increase in sales which resulted from the exit of another large insurance provider from the uk group risk market 
segment outlook the challenging economic and competitive pricing environment in the uk continue to negatively impact unum uk s premium growth  and we expect this may continue in the near term if current economic and competitive conditions in the uk persist 
our sales growth may also continue to be impacted by a prolonged competitive pricing environment in the uk the level of disability claim incidence in was favorable relative to the same period of  but our claim resolutions were unfavorable relative to the due in part to a lower level of early duration claims and the impact of the economic environment on our ability to resolve claims 
the current economic conditions may lead to a higher rate of claim incidence  lower levels of claim recoveries  or lower claim discount rates 
we are initiating price increases for our group disability and group life products during to mitigate the impact of the current economic conditions 
we continuously monitor key indicators to assess our risks and attempt to adjust our business plans accordingly 
continued fluctuations in the us dollar relative to the british pound sterling impact our reported operating results 
our current growth strategy focuses on generating organic growth and expanding our role as the leading provider of group disability insurance in the uk our strategy for future growth combines optimizing the performance of our existing business while developing new market opportunities 
we intend to optimize performance of the existing business by i increasing underwriting and pricing discipline  ii improving our claims management processes  and iii expanding our broker market capabilities and sales effectiveness 
we intend to develop new market opportunities by raising awareness of the need for income protection  including seeking to increase coverage of currently insured groups to include a greater percentage of the workforce  and by offering a suite of employer and employee paid workplace solutions using integrated products with simpler  defined choices and flexible funding options through a streamlined and efficient platform with online capabilities matched to broker and employer needs 
in the current competitive pricing market and economic environment  we continue to have a cautious outlook for premium growth 
we anticipate returning to more normalized levels of premium growth through stable persistency and price increases  as well as increased sales to existing and new customers which we expect to occur commensurate with the timing of the uk economic recovery 
we expect our overall benefit ratio in to be favorable compared to we expect our profit margins to continue at a favorable level  consistent with colonial life segment the colonial life segment includes insurance for accident  sickness  and disability products  life products  and cancer and critical illness products issued primarily by colonial life accident insurance company and marketed to employees at the workplace through an independent contractor agency sales force and brokers

although we experienced premium growth in  the growth rate continued to be negatively impacted by economic conditions that we believe affected the buying patterns of employees 
net investment income was higher in compared to due primarily to growth in the level of assets and higher bond call premiums  partially offset by a decrease in income from partnership investments 
the overall benefit ratio was higher in compared to due to less favorable risk results in the accident  sickness  and disability product line due to a higher level of incurred claims in our accident and disability products 
risk results in the life product line were slightly lower in compared to risk results in the cancer and critical illness product line were generally consistent in compared to commissions and the deferral of acquisition costs were both higher in compared to due primarily to an increase in costs related to growth in new business premium 
the amortization of deferred acquisition costs continues to increase as the level of the deferred asset grows 
the other expense ratio was lower in compared to due primarily to higher premium income and a continued focus on expense management 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  premium income increased in relative to due primarily to increased sales and favorable persistency  although premium growth was negatively impacted in both years due to economic conditions 
net investment income increased in in comparison to due to growth in the level of assets  an increase in income from partnership investments  and an increase in bond call premiums 
the overall benefit ratio increased in relative to due to unfavorable experience in the accident  sickness  and disability product line resulting from an increase in the level of paid claims and reserves driven by a higher level of claim incidence and slightly higher average claim sizes 
the cancer and critical illness benefit ratio increased relative to due primarily to the continued higher levels of large claims on the older block of cancer products  partially offset by a refinement of the loss adjustment expense reserve calculation 
somewhat negatively affecting year over year comparisons is the release of active life reserves in the second quarter of in our cancer and critical illness product line 
the life benefit ratio decreased in relative to due primarily to favorable mortality 
commissions and the deferral of acquisition costs both increased in compared to due primarily to increased sales 
the amortization of deferred acquisition costs in was higher relative to due to the continued increase in the level of deferred acquisition costs  offset partially by the decrease in amortization related to certain of our interest sensitive policies 
the other expense ratio decreased in compared to due primarily to a continued focus on expense management 
sales in millions of dollars year ended december change change accident  sickness  and disability life cancer and critical illness total sales colonial life s sales were higher in relative to  with new account sales percent above the level of  and existing account sales percent higher than in commercial market sales were percent higher in compared to  driven primarily by a sales increase of percent in the core commercial market segment  which we define as accounts with fewer than  lives 
sales in the large case commercial market segment decreased percent in compared to in the public sector market  sales were generally consistent in as compared to sales results for were unfavorably impacted by our decision to discontinue selling our limited benefit medical product during the number of new accounts declined percent in compared to  while the average new case size was percent higher for relative to colonial life s sales were higher in compared to  with percent growth in new account sales  and percent growth in existing account sales relative to the prior year 
commercial market sales were percent higher in compared to  driven primarily by a sales increase of percent in the core commercial market segment 
sales in the large case commercial market segment increased percent in compared to in the public sector market  sales were percent lower in compared to the number of new accounts added in was percent higher than  while the average new case size was percent lower relative to segment outlook our premium growth in was in line with the level of growth in but is below the level of our long term growth expectations 
we believe slower sales and premium growth levels may continue in the near term if the current economic conditions persist and continue to affect employment growth and the buying patterns of employees 
we expect volatility in net investment income to continue during as a result of fluctuations in bond calls and other types of miscellaneous net investment income 
periods of economic downturns have historically had minimal impact on the risk results of colonial life  due primarily to a diversified product portfolio that is designed with short duration  indemnity benefits 
we continuously monitor key indicators to assess our risks and attempt to adjust our business plans accordingly 
we believe we have a stable business model  with service levels and customer retention that allow us to focus on and deliver premium growth despite the recent marketplace changes and uncertainties 
we believe we are well positioned for growth and that opportunities exist to accelerate growth during the next several years by i focusing on target market segments  ii driving new sales in the public sector market  iii growing the reach and effectiveness of our distribution  and iv effectively serving our customers 
during  we expect premium growth to be modest relative to our long term outlook 
we believe that strong profit margins will continue  and we expect our overall benefit ratio to be generally consistent with the level of we believe premium growth will re accelerate as the economy improves  employment growth resumes  and our growth strategies gain momentum 
closed block segment as previously noted  effective with the fourth quarter of  we modified our reporting segments 
the closed block segment now consists of our closed individual disability and long term care lines of business  as well as certain other insurance products 
the individual disability line of business generally consists of those policies in force before the substantial changes in product offerings  pricing  distribution  and underwriting  which generally occurred during the period through a small amount of new business continued to be sold after these changes  but we stopped selling new individual disability policies in this segment at the beginning of other than update features contractually allowable on existing policies 
long term care includes group long term care  which we announced in february that we would discontinue selling  and individual long term care  which we discontinued selling in the other insurance products line of business consists of certain other products no longer actively marketed  including individual life and corporate owned life insurance  reinsurance pools and management operations  group pension  health insurance  and individual annuities

individual disability year ended december  compared with year ended december  the decrease in premium income in compared to is due to the run off of this closed line of business driven by expected policy terminations and maturities 
net investment income was lower in compared to due to a decrease in bond call premiums and a lower level of assets supporting this closed line of business 
other income  which includes the underlying results of certain blocks of reinsured business and the net investment income of portfolios held by those ceding companies to support the block we have reinsured  decreased in compared to due to lower investment income in the portfolios held by the ceding companies 
risk results were unfavorable relative to the prior year due to the previously discussed reserve charge 
excluding the reserve charge  risk results were slightly favorable compared to due to higher claim recoveries  partially offset by higher claim incidence rates 
see claim reserve increase for individual disability closed block business included herein in this item interest and debt expense in was lower than in due to a decline in the amount of outstanding debt issued by northwind holdings as a result of principal repayments 
the other expense ratio was favorable in compared to due to lower claim litigation costs and lower expenses related to claim volumes  partially offset by lower premium income 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  the decrease in premium income for compared to is due to the expected due to run off of this closed line of business 
net investment income for was slightly higher than  with higher bond call premiums mostly offset by a lower level of assets supporting this closed line of business 
other income decreased in relative to due to less favorable investment results from the portfolios held by the ceding companies as well as less favorable risk results from the reinsured business 
the interest adjusted loss ratio for increased relative to due to lower claim recoveries and lower claim settlements  partially offset by lower claim incidence rates 
interest and debt expense in declined when compared to due to lower rates of interest on our floating rate debt issued by northwind holdings and a decrease in the amount of outstanding debt resulting from principal repayments 
the other expense ratio decreased in compared to due primarily to lower claims management and claim litigation costs relative to the declining level of premium income 
long term care year ended december  compared with year ended december  the increase in premium income for relative to was driven by strong persistency and higher sales of group long term care  which increased percent in compared to net investment income was higher in compared to due to primarily to an increase in the level of assets supporting this line of business  partially offset by a decline in the level of prepayment income on mortgage backed securities and a decrease in bond call premiums 
risk results were unfavorable relative to the prior year due to the previously discussed reserve charge 
excluding the reserve charge  risk results were unfavorable compared to due to increases in active life reserves  which were driven by favorable premium persistency relative to assumptions for certain issue years 
claim incidence rates for long term care were also higher in compared to the deferral of acquisition costs was higher in relative to due to the increase in deferrable expenses associated with higher sales of group long term care products 
the amortization of deferred acquisition costs was lower in than in due to lower levels of accelerated amortization related to favorable premium persistency relative to assumptions for certain issue years 
as previously discussed  at december  we determined that our long term care deferred acquisition costs of million were not recoverable  and we recognized an impairment charge at that time 
see long term care strategic review included herein in this item for discussion of the reserve charge and the impairment 
in late  we began a process of filing requests with various state insurance departments for a rate increase on certain of our individual long term care policies 
the rate increase reflects current interest rates and claim experience  higher expected future claims  persistency  and other factors related to pricing individual long term care coverage 
in states for which a rate increase is submitted and approved  customers are also given options for coverage changes or other approaches that might fit their current financial and insurance needs 
higher premium income associated with the rate increase is expected to begin to emerge during year ended december  compared with year ended december  the slight increase in premium income for relative to was driven by favorable persistency and higher sales of group long term care  which increased percent in compared to net investment income for was higher than due to an increase in the level of assets supporting this line of business  an increase in the level of prepayment income on mortgage backed securities  and an increase in bond call premiums 
the interest adjusted loss ratio for long term care increased in relative to due primarily to an increase in the active life reserve and higher paid claim incidence rates 
commissions and the deferral of acquisition costs were lower in relative to due primarily to the discontinuance of individual long term care sales 
the amortization of acquisition costs increased in relative to due primarily to an acceleration of amortization resulting from lower persistency in certain older issue years 
all other our other insurance products had generally consistent performance year over year  with the exception of higher litigation costs in segment outlook we expect that this segment may experience volatility in net investment income due to the variability in interest rates on floating rate assets and also due to volatility of bond call premiums relative to historical levels 
a portion of the volatility in interest income will be offset by commensurate changes in the interest expense on our individual disability floating rate debt 
we expect that operating revenue and income for this segment will continue to decline over time as these closed blocks of business wind down  although we do expect higher premium income associated with long term care rate increases 
we also expect a small amount of new group long term care business to continue to be sold through features contractually allowable on existing group policies 
profitability of our long tailed products is affected by claims experience related to mortality and morbidity  investment returns  and persistency 
we believe that the interest adjusted loss ratios for the individual disability and long term care lines of business will be relatively flat over the long term  but these product lines may experience quarterly volatility 
claim resolution rates  which measure the resolution of claims from recovery  deaths  settlements  and benefit expirations  are very sensitive to operational and environmental changes and can be volatile 
our claim resolution rate assumption used in determining reserves is our expectation of the resolution rate we will experience over the life of the block of business and will vary from actual experience in any one period 
it is possible that variability in any of our reserve assumptions  including  but not limited to  interest rates  mortality  morbidity  and persistency  could result in a material impact on our reserve levels 
corporate segment the corporate segment includes investment income on corporate assets not specifically allocated to a line of business  interest expense on corporate debt other than non recourse debt  and certain other corporate income and expense not allocated to a line of business 
as previously noted  this segment was modified effective with the fourth quarter of to reclassify the results from certain insurance products no longer actively marketed from the previously named corporate and other segment to the closed block segment 
operating results in millions of dollars year ended december change change operating revenue net investment income other income nm total expenses interest and debt expense other expenses total operating loss before income tax and net realized investment gains and losses nm not a meaningful percentage year ended december  compared with year ended december  net investment income was lower in compared to due to lower short term interest rates  lower asset levels  a lower proportion of assets invested at long term interest rates  a decrease in bond call premiums  and an increase in the amortization of the principle amount invested in our tax credit partnerships 
the negative impact on net investment income and operating income by segment due to the higher level of investment in tax credit partnerships is offset by a lower income tax rate due to the tax benefits recognized as a result of these investments 
other income was higher in compared to due to million of interest income related to the previously discussed settlement of our appeal to the irs related to tax years to interest and debt expense increased in relative to due primarily to the september issuance of million of senior notes  partially offset by the maturity of our million senior notes in march we experienced lower interest in compared to on our million unsecured senior notes which we effectively converted into floating rate debt through the use of an interest rate swap entered into during the fourth quarter of other expenses increased in compared to due primarily to increases in expense accruals  general operating expenses due in part to corporate initiatives  and state income taxes resulting from the repatriation of uk dividends from our uk subsidiaries 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  net investment income was higher in compared to due to higher asset levels and a higher proportion of assets invested at long term interest rates  partially offset by lower interest rates on short term investments 
interest and debt expense increased in compared to due primarily to the september issuance of million of senior notes and the september issuance of million of senior notes 
the higher interest and debt expense associated with the two new debt issuances was partially offset by the repayment of million of medium term notes due during the first quarter of and the repayment of million of senior notes during the second quarter of the decrease in other expenses was due primarily to lower pension costs 
segment outlook we expect the quality of our investment portfolio to remain strong in we are currently holding capital at our insurance subsidiaries and holding companies at levels that exceed our long term requirements 
we expect to continue to generate excess capital on an annual basis through strong statutory earnings 
while we intend to maintain our disciplined approach to risk management throughout  we believe we are well positioned with substantial flexibility to preserve our capital strength and at the same time explore opportunities to deploy the excess capital that is generated each period 
investments overview our investment portfolio is well diversified by type of investment and industry sector 
we have established an investment strategy that we believe will provide for adequate cash flows from operations and allow us to hold our securities through periods where significant decreases in fair value occur 
we believe our emphasis on risk management in our investment portfolio  including credit and interest rate management  has positioned us well and generally reduced the volatility in our results 
we have no exposure to subprime mortgages  alt a loans  or collateralized debt obligations in our asset backed  mortgage backed securities  or public bond portfolios 
we have no direct exposure to sovereign debt of certain countries in the european union  specifically greece  ireland  italy  portugal  and spain 
at december   we had minimal exposure to investments for which the payment of interest and principal is guaranteed under a financial guaranty insurance policy  and all such securities are rated investment grade absent the guaranty insurance policy 
at december   we held million fair value million amortized cost of perpetual debentures  or hybrid securities  that generally have no fixed maturity date 
interest on these securities due on any payment date may be deferred by the issuer 
the interest payments are generally deferrable only to the extent that the issuer has suspended dividends or other distributions or payments to any of its shareholders or any other perpetual debt instrument 
below is a summary of our formal investment policy  including the overall quality and diversification objectives the majority of investments are in high quality publicly traded securities to ensure the desired liquidity and preserve the capital value of our portfolios 
the long term nature of our insurance liabilities also allows us to invest in less liquid investments to obtain superior returns 
a maximum of percent of the total investment portfolio may be invested in below investment grade securities  percent in equity securities  percent in tax credit funds  up to percent in private placements  and percent in commercial mortgage loans 
the remaining assets can be held in publicly traded investment grade corporate securities  mortgage backed securities  bank loans  asset backed securities  government and government agencies  and municipal securities 
we intend to manage the risk of losses due to changes in interest rates by matching asset duration with liabilities  in the aggregate 
the weighted average credit quality rating of the portfolio should be baa or higher 
the maximum investment per issuer group is limited based on internal limits reviewed by the finance committee of unum group s board of directors and approved by the boards of directors of our insurance subsidiaries and is more restrictive than the five percent limit generally allowed by the state insurance departments which regulate the type of investments our insurance subsidiaries are allowed to own 
these internal limits are as follows rating internal limit in millions aaa aa a bbb bbb bbb bb bb bb b b b ccc the portfolio is to be diversified across industry classification and geographic lines 
derivative instruments may be used to replicate permitted asset classes  hedge interest rate risk and foreign currency risk  and match liability duration and cash flows consistent with the plan reviewed by the finance committee of unum group s board of directors and approved by the boards of directors of our insurance subsidiaries 
asset mix guidelines and limits are established by us  reviewed by the finance committee of unum group s board of directors  and approved by the boards of directors of our insurance subsidiaries 
the allocation of assets and the selection and timing of the acquisition and disposition of investments are subject to ratification  on a weekly basis  by an investment subcommittee appointed by the boards of directors of our insurance subsidiaries 
these actions are also reviewed by the finance committee of unum group s board of directors on a quarterly basis 
we review these investment policies and guidelines annually  or more frequently if deemed necessary  and recommend adjustments  as appropriate 
any revisions are reviewed by the finance committee of unum group s board of directors and must be approved by the boards of directors of our insurance subsidiaries 
see critical accounting estimates contained in this item for further discussion of our valuation of investments 
investment results net investment income increased percent in relative to due primarily to continued growth in the level of invested assets and higher bond call premiums  partially offset by an increase in the amortization of the principal amount invested in our tax credit partnerships driven by the higher level of investment in this asset class  a decrease in income on other partnership investments  and a decline in the level of prepayment income on mortgage backed securities 
net investment income increased percent in relative to due primarily to continued growth in the level of invested assets and higher bond call premiums 
we also received higher interest income during and  compared to the preceding years  on bonds for which interest income is linked to a uk inflation index 
in addition  we earned lower interest rates on our floating rate invested assets during compared to  largely offset by lower interest expense on our floating rate debt 
the duration weighted book yield on the fixed income securities in our investment portfolio was percent as of december   compared to a yield of percent as of december  as previously noted  we actively manage our asset and liability cash flow match and our asset and liability duration match to limit interest rate risk 
duration is a measure of the percentage change in the fair values of assets and liabilities for a given change in interest rates 
cash flows from the in force asset and liability portfolios are projected at current interest rate levels and also at levels reflecting an increase and a decrease in interest rates to obtain a range of projected cash flows under the different interest rate scenarios 
these results enable us to assess the impact of projected changes in cash flows and duration resulting from potential changes in interest rates 
to assess the impact of a duration mismatch  we measure the potential changes in estimated fair value based on a hypothetical change in interest rates to quantify a dollar value change 
although we test the asset and liability portfolios under various interest rate scenarios as part of our modeling  the majority of our liabilities related to insurance contracts are not interest rate sensitive  and we therefore have minimal exposure to policy withdrawal risk 
our determination of investment strategy relies more on long term measures such as reserve adequacy analysis and the relationship between the portfolio yields supporting our various product lines and the aggregate discount rates embedded in the reserves 
realized investment gains and losses  before tax  are as follows in millions of dollars year ended december fixed maturity securities gross gains on sales gross losses on sales other than temporary impairment loss mortgage loans and other invested assets gross gains on sales gross losses on sales impairment loss foreign currency transactions embedded derivative in modified coinsurance arrangement other derivatives net realized investment gain loss additional information regarding individual realized investment losses of million or greater from other than temporary impairments and or sales during the years   and  if applicable  is as follows 
realized investment losses million or greater from other than temporary impairments during  we recognized an other than temporary impairment loss of million on securities issued by a netherlands financial services company 
the company recorded significant impairment losses in its securities and real estate portfolios during and and required a significant amount of government aid 
at the time of the impairment loss  these securities had been in an unrealized loss position for a period of greater than three years 
during  we recognized an other than temporary impairment loss of million on securities issued by a us media conglomerate 
the company reported mixed fourth quarter operating results as its outdoor advertising weakened significantly 
during the first quarter of  the company borrowed billion against its lines of credit and completed a tender exchange offer to improve its near term debt maturity profile 
continued signs that the company s operations had weakened materially in the first quarter  as well as the continued weakness in the economy  led us to believe that covenant violations could occur in the near future 
at the time of the impairment loss  these securities had been in an unrealized loss position for a period of greater than three years 
during  we recognized an other than temporary impairment loss of million on securities issued by a uk financial institution 
the decline in value of the securities was primarily the result of the global credit crisis and the slowdown in the economy 
in addition  this financial institution made a major acquisition during the peak of the past credit cycle 
the financial institution then had to recognize impairments on loans and other assets held by the acquired company  resulting in the need for additional capital 
this capital was initially provided by shareholders and others  but as the economic environment further deteriorated  the financial institution participated in the government guarantee of senior debt  capital injections  and an asset protection scheme 
at the time of the impairment loss  these securities had been in an unrealized loss position for a period of greater than three years 
during  we recognized an other than temporary impairment loss of million on securities issued by a us automotive parts company 
due to the weak economy  automobile production had decreased dramatically  with the expectation of further production reductions at the time of the impairment loss 
declining earnings caused the company to be out of compliance with covenants in certain of its debt issues 
the company eventually obtained waivers on these covenants  the terms of which precluded the company from making interest payments on certain of its other debt issues 
the company was unable to cure this default within the grace period and ultimately was forced to file for bankruptcy 
at the time of the impairment loss  these securities had been in an unrealized loss position for a period of greater than three years 
during  we recognized an other than temporary impairment loss of million on principal protected equity linked trust certificates representing our investment in a trust which held forward contracts to purchase shares of a vanguard s p index mutual fund 
we recognized the other than temporary impairment loss because we intended to sell the security 
at the time of the impairment loss  these securities had been in an unrealized loss position for a period of greater than one year but less than two years 
during  we recognized an other than temporary impairment loss of million on securities issued by a large specialty chemical company 
the company reported fourth quarter earnings that were weaker than expected  which limited its prospects of refinancing its debt maturities 
the company had been pursuing asset sales to raise cash but was unable to do so in time to avoid a financial restructuring 
during the first quarter of  the company filed for bankruptcy protection 
at the time of the impairment loss  these securities had been in an unrealized loss position for a period of greater than two years but less than three years 
during  we recognized an other than temporary impairment loss of million on securities issued by a us automotive parts company 
the majority of the company s revenues were generated by sales to a single domestic automobile manufacturer 
due to the weak economy  automobile production had decreased dramatically  with the expectation of further production cuts 
the us government made available a billion credit facility to several automotive parts companies to help maintain automotive supplier liquidity 
however  with their largest customer likely to undergo a major financial restructuring and or bankruptcy filing  the company faced increased challenges 
in march its external auditors stated there was substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern if the automotive industry s financial problems were not resolved soon 
at the time of the impairment loss  these securities had been in an unrealized loss position for a period of greater than three years 
during  we recognized an other than temporary impairment loss of million on securities issued by a uk financial institution 
during  a significant decrease in funding liquidity ultimately required the uk government to nationalize this institution 
in this process  the government provided guarantees on deposits  senior debt  and loans 
since  the company initiated several programs to improve its liquidity and to repay the loans to the government 
in the first quarter of  the company announced it had developed a plan for a legal and capital restructuring of the company  which it expected to complete in the second half of during the second quarter of  the company submitted its plan to the european commission ec and requested permission to begin the program under ec competition rules 
the ec released various aspects of the company s restructuring plan  which included splitting the company into multiple entities 
it appeared we would be unable to recover the entire cost basis of our securities  which are subordinate to the government s debt as well as other creditors 
at the time of the impairment loss  these securities had been in an unrealized loss position for a period of greater than two years but less than three years 
realized investment losses million or greater from sale of fixed maturity securities during  we recognized a loss of million on the sale of securities issued by a large publisher of yellow page advertising 
the company had suffered from deterioration in print directories advertising as well as a significant rise in bad debt expenses due to the impact of the recession on small business customers 
the company maintained significant amounts of available cash and was still generating free cash flows despite the weakening economy 
however  during the first quarter of  the company announced that it had hired a financial adviser to review its capital structure alternatives regarding debt payments due in at the time of disposition  these securities had been in an unrealized loss position for a period of greater than three years 
embedded derivative in a modified coinsurance arrangement we report changes in the fair value of an embedded derivative in a modified coinsurance arrangement as realized investment gains and losses  as required under the provisions of gaap 
gaap requires us to include in our realized investment gains and losses a calculation intended to estimate the value of the option of our reinsurance counterparty to cancel the reinsurance contract with us 
however  neither party can unilaterally terminate the reinsurance agreement except in extreme circumstances resulting from regulatory supervision  delinquency proceedings  or other direct regulatory action 
cash settlements or collateral related to this embedded derivative are not required at any time during the reinsurance contract or at termination of the reinsurance contract  and any accumulated embedded derivative gain or loss reduces to zero over time as the reinsured business winds down 
we therefore view the effect of realized gains and losses recognized for this embedded derivative as a reporting requirement that will not result in a permanent change in assets or stockholders equity 
the change in fair value of this embedded derivative recognized as a realized gain or loss during   and resulted primarily from a change in credit spreads in the overall investment market 
the fair value of this embedded derivative was million at december   compared to million at december   and is reported in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets

the mortgage asset backed securities are valued on a monthly basis using valuations supplied by the brokerage firms that are dealers in these securities as well as independent pricing services 
one of the risks involved in investing in mortgage asset backed securities is the uncertainty of the timing of cash flows from the underlying loans due to prepayment of principal with the possibility of reinvesting the funds in a lower interest rate environment 
we use models which incorporate economic variables and possible future interest rate scenarios to predict future prepayment rates 
the timing of prepayment cash flows may also cause volatility in our recognition of investment income 
we recognize investment income on these securities using a constant effective yield based on projected prepayments of the underlying loans and the estimated economic life of the securities 
actual prepayment experience is reviewed periodically  and effective yields are recalculated when differences arise between prepayments originally projected and the actual prepayments received and currently projected 
the effective yield is recalculated on a retrospective basis  and the adjustment is reflected in net investment income 
we have not invested in mortgage backed derivatives  such as interest only  principal only  or residuals  where market values can be highly volatile relative to changes in interest rates 
all of our mortgage backed securities have fixed rate coupons 
the credit quality of our mortgage backed securities portfolio has not been negatively impacted by the issues in the market concerning subprime mortgage loans 
the change in value of our mortgage backed securities portfolio has moved in line with that of prime agency backed mortgage backed securities 
as of december   the amortized cost and fair value of our below investment grade fixed maturity securities was  million and  million  respectively 
below investment grade securities are inherently more risky than investment grade securities since the risk of default by the issuer  by definition and as exhibited by bond rating  is higher 
also  the secondary market for certain below investment grade issues can be highly illiquid 
additional downgrades may occur  but we do not anticipate any liquidity problems resulting from our investments in below investment grade securities  nor do we expect these investments to adversely affect our ability to hold our other investments to maturity 
investments in issuers in certain european countries our investments are chosen for specific portfolio management purposes  including asset and liability management and portfolio diversification across geographic lines and sectors to minimize non market risks 
in our approach to investing in fixed maturity securities  specific investments within approved countries and industry sectors are evaluated for their market position and specific strengths and potential weaknesses 
for each security  we consider the political  legal and financial environment of the sovereign entity in which an issuer is domiciled and operates 
the country of domicile is based on consideration of the issuer s headquarters  in addition to location of the assets and the country in which the majority of sales and earnings are derived 
we continually evaluate our foreign investment risk exposure  including that within certain countries in the european union  specifically greece  ireland  italy  portugal  and spain 
our monitoring is heightened for investments in these specific countries due to our concerns over the current economic and political environments as well as the banking crisis  and we believe these investments are more vulnerable to potential credit problems 
we do not have foreign currency risk  as the cash flows from these investments are denominated in currencies to match the related liabilities 
we have no direct exposure to sovereign debt of these countries and have not used credit derivatives to hedge our exposure or to sell credit protection 
our exposure relates only to non financial institutions and is as follows european fixed maturity securities exposure by country as of december  in millions of dollars fair value amortized cost greece ireland italy portugal spain total we have no unfunded commitments to issuers domiciled in these countries 
further discussion on our exposure to each country is as follows greece we have no direct exposure to greek financial institutions 
our singular holding domiciled in greece is a geographically diversified company  generates less than percent of its revenue from greece  and was rated investment grade as of december  the company aggregates cash and manages its debt payments outside the country in which it is domiciled  which we believe enables the company to place low reliance on the banking system of greece 
as of december   this company was current on its obligations to us  and we believe it will continue to meet its debt obligations 
this security was in an unrealized gain position as of december  ireland we have no direct exposure to irish financial institutions 
in november  ireland received a support package valued at billion from the international monetary fund european union based on its plan of recovery 
thus far  ireland appears committed to fiscal consolidation 
however  we believe there are risks associated with the austerity and recessionary pressures 
as of december   all of our irish investments were current on their obligations to us  and we believe they will continue to meet their debt obligations 
in addition  we have the intent to hold these investments to recovery in value 
as a result  we did not recognize any other than temporary impairment losses on these investments as of december  italy we have no direct exposure to italian financial institutions 
we believe there are risks associated with the debt sustainability of italy given the high refinancing rates  lack of competitiveness  and recessionary pressures 
as of december   all of our italian investments were current on their obligations to us  and we believe they will continue to meet their debt obligations 
in addition  we have the intent to hold these investments to recovery in value 
as a result  we did not recognize any other than temporary impairment losses on these investments as of december  portugal we have no direct exposure to portuguese financial institutions 
in may  portugal received a support package valued at billion from the international monetary fund european union 
we believe there is risk that portugal will be unable to achieve the deficit reduction targets set out in this loan agreement  and future aid may require private sector participation 
as of december   our only holdings in portugal consisted of two investment grade issuers 
these companies were current on their obligations to us  and we believe they will continue to meet their debt obligations 
in addition  we have the intent to hold these investments to recovery in value 
as a result  we did not recognize any other than temporary impairment losses on these investments as of december  spain we have no direct exposure to spanish financial institutions  although we do own fixed maturity securities of certain united kingdom and united states subsidiaries of spanish financial institutions 
spain has a high budget deficit of percent compared to their stated percent target 
we believe there are risks associated with spain s high unemployment  banking sector problems in which the market expects more impairment losses  and recessionary pressures 
all of our spanish domiciled securities were rated investment grade as of december  and were current on their obligations to us 
we believe they will continue to have the ability to meet their debt obligations 
in addition  we have the intent to hold these investments to recovery in value 
as a result  we did not recognize any other than temporary impairment losses on these investments as of december  risk management while we have no direct sovereign holdings in the aforementioned countries  we have performed comprehensive stress testing and scenario analyses on all of our corporate holdings of issuers domiciled in these countries 
we have performed stress tests under a number of scenarios including deep recession  liquidity crisis  and currency redenomination with significant devaluation 
we continue to closely monitor this situation 
a potential risk for these corporate holdings is access to bank lines in their countries of domicile and redenomination risk as it pertains to their outstanding liabilities 
even in the scenario of currency redenomination and liquidity crisis  we believe the risk is largely mitigated because our holdings in these countries are non financial and operate in defensive industries that provide essential services 
most are market leaders with access to diverse  global capital markets 
current developments regarding ratings downgrades  bailout packages  or higher sovereign interest rates have not had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
mortgage loans our mortgage loan portfolio was  million and  million on an amortized cost basis at december  and december   respectively 
our mortgage loan portfolio is comprised entirely of commercial mortgage loans 
we believe our mortgage loan portfolio is well diversified geographically and among property types 
the incidence of problem mortgage loans and foreclosure activity continues to be low 
due to conservative underwriting  we expect the level of problem loans to remain low relative to the industry 
we held two mortgage loans at december  and which were considered impaired 
these mortgage loans were carried at the estimated net realizable values of million and million  respectively  net of a valuation allowance of million at each period end 
during  we foreclosed on two impaired mortgage loans and transferred them into other long term investments in our consolidated balance sheets 
no realized loss was recognized on the foreclosures 
during  we sold one mortgage loan and recognized a loss of million on the sale 
derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage reinvestment risk  duration  and currency risk 
historically  we have utilized current and forward interest rate swaps and options on forward interest rate swaps  current and forward currency swaps  forward treasury locks  currency forward contracts  and forward contracts on specific fixed income securities 
our current credit exposure on derivatives  which is limited to the value of those contracts in a net gain position less collateral held  was million at december  we held million of cash collateral from our counterparties at december  the carrying value of fixed maturity securities posted as collateral to our counterparties was million at december  we believe that our credit risk is mitigated by our use of multiple counterparties  all of which have a median credit rating of a or better  and by our use of cross collateralization agreements 
other our exposure to non current investments  defined as foreclosed real estate and invested assets which are delinquent as to interest and or principal payments  totaled million and million on a fair value basis at december  and december   respectively 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item for further discussion of our investments and our derivative financial instruments 
liquidity and capital resources our liquidity requirements are met primarily by cash flows provided from operations  principally in our insurance subsidiaries 
premium and investment income  as well as maturities and sales of invested assets  provide the primary sources of cash 
debt and or securities offerings provide an additional source of liquidity 
cash is applied to the payment of policy benefits  costs of acquiring new business principally commissions  operating expenses  and taxes  as well as purchases of new investments 
we have established an investment strategy that we believe will provide for adequate cash flows from operations 
we attempt to match our asset cash flows and durations with expected liability cash flows and durations to meet the funding requirements of our business 
however  deterioration in the credit market may delay our ability to sell our positions in certain of our fixed maturity securities in a timely manner and adversely impact the price we receive for such securities  which may negatively impact our cash flows 
furthermore  if we experience defaults on securities held in the investment portfolios of our insurance subsidiaries  this will negatively impact statutory capital  which could reduce our insurance subsidiaries capacity to pay dividends to our holding companies 
a reduction in dividends to our holding companies could force us to seek external financing to avoid impairing our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders or meet our debt and other payment obligations 
our policy benefits are primarily in the form of claim payments  and we have minimal exposure to the policy withdrawal risk associated with deposit products such as individual life policies or annuities 
a decrease in demand for our insurance products or an increase in the incidence of new claims or the duration of existing claims could negatively impact our cash flows from operations 
however  our historical pattern of benefits paid to revenues is consistent  even during cycles of economic downturns  which serves to minimize liquidity risk 
we have met all minimum pension funding requirements set forth by erisa 
we made voluntary contributions to our us qualified defined benefit pension plan of million and million during the first and fourth quarters of  respectively 
the fourth quarter of contribution was made in lieu of our planned contribution  and we made no additional contributions to our us qualified defined benefit plan during we expect to make a voluntary contribution of approximately million to our us qualified defined benefit plan during we have estimated our future funding requirements under the pension protection act of and do not believe that the funding requirements will cause a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
we also contribute to our uk pension plan sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirement under uk legislation 
we made required contributions during of million  and we expect to make contributions of approximately million during in may  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of unum group s common stock  with the pace of repurchase activity to depend upon various factors such as the level of available cash  alternative uses for cash  and our stock price 
during  we repurchased million shares  at a cost of million  under this share repurchase program 
the million share repurchase program had an expiration date of may in february  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to billion of unum group s common stock  in addition to the amount remaining to be repurchased under the million authorization 
the billion share repurchase program has an expiration date of august during  we repurchased million shares  at a cost of million  using an accelerated repurchase agreement with a financial counterparty 
under the terms of the repurchase agreement  we received a price adjustment based on the volume weighted average price of our common stock during the term of the agreement 
the price adjustment resulted in the delivery to us of approximately million additional shares 
in total  we repurchased million shares of our common stock under this agreement 
the shares repurchased pursuant to the accelerated repurchase agreement completed the million repurchase authorization and initiated the billion repurchase program 
in addition to these repurchases  during we repurchased an additional million shares on the open market at a cost of million  for a total repurchase of million shares during cash equivalents and marketable securities held at unum group and our other intermediate holding companies are a significant source of liquidity for us and were approximately million and billion at december  and  respectively 
the decrease during reflects the purchase and retirement of million of our senior notes as well as the repurchase of shares of our common stock 
the december  balance  of which million was held in certain of our foreign subsidiaries in the uk  was made up primarily of commercial paper  fixed maturity securities with a current average maturity of years  and various money market funds 
no significant restrictions exist on our ability to use or access these funds  with the exception of funds held in the uk during the fourth quarter of  we repatriated million  or approximately million  from our uk subsidiaries  which was subject to repatriation tax effects of million 
we currently have no intent  nor do we foresee a need  to repatriate additional funds 
we believe we hold domestic resources sufficient to fund our liquidity requirements for the next months and that our current level of holding company cash and marketable securities can be utilized to mitigate potential losses from defaults 
if we repatriate additional funds from our subsidiaries in the uk  the amounts repatriated would be subject to repatriation tax effects which generally equal the difference in the us tax rate and the us tax rate 
unum limited is expected to adopt new capital requirements and risk management standards under solvency ii effective january  solvency ii requirements  which result from a fundamental review of the capital adequacy standards for the european insurance industry  have not been fully finalized  but the current proposals contain amended requirements on capital adequacy and risk management for insurers 
we continue to assess the impact on our capital requirements 
our bermuda based insurance subsidiary is subject to regulation by the bermuda monetary authority bma 
during  the bma initiated a comprehensive review of its insurance regulatory and solvency framework and continued to work with european regulators throughout toward completion of the assessment 
it is too early to assess the impact  but the insurance industry may ultimately be subject to new rules regarding governance  administrative and accounting processes  and or long term capital requirements 
see capital requirements contained herein in item for additional information 
during  we intend to retain a level of capital in our traditional us insurance subsidiaries such that we maintain a weighted average rbc level well above capital adequacy requirements 
we also expect unum limited to operate above the fsa capital adequacy requirements and minimum solvency margins 
consolidated cash flows operating cash flows net cash provided by operating activities was  million for the year ended december   compared to  million and  million for and  respectively 
operating cash flows are primarily attributable to the receipt of premium and investment income  offset by payments of claims  commissions  expenses  and income taxes 
premium income growth is dependent not only on new sales  but on renewals of existing business  renewal price increases  and persistency 
investment income growth is dependent on the growth in the underlying assets supporting our insurance reserves and on the earned yield 
the level of commissions and operating expenses is attributable to the level of sales and the first year acquisition expenses associated with new business as well as the maintenance of existing business 
the level of paid claims is affected partially by the growth and aging of the block of business and also by the general economy  as previously discussed in the operating results by segment 
operating cash flows for and include pension contributions of approximately million and million  respectively 
the fluctuation in the income tax adjustment to reconcile and net income to net cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to decreases in the deferred tax liability related to the deferred acquisition cost charge and reserve charges for our long term care and individual disability closed blocks of business 
investing cash flows investing cash inflows consist primarily of the proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments 
investing cash outflows consist primarily of payments for purchases of investments 
net cash used by investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to  million and  million for and  respectively 
our sales of available for sale securities increased in compared to  but declined in relative to proceeds from maturities of available for sale securities were lower in compared to primarily due to a significant decrease in bond calls 
proceeds from maturities of available for sale securities were higher in compared to primarily due to a significant increase in bond calls and bond maturities 
proceeds from sales and maturities of other investments decreased slightly in compared to primarily due to a decrease in maturities from mortgage loans offset by an increase in distributions received from private equity partnerships and an increase in proceeds from terminations of derivative contracts within our cash flow hedging programs 
proceeds from sales and maturities of other investments decreased in as compared to primarily due to a decrease in proceeds from terminations of derivative contracts within our cash flow hedging programs  partially offset by an increase in maturities of commercial mortgage loans 
purchases of available for sale securities were lower in compared to as a result of the decline in funds available for reinvestment due to the decrease in bond calls  as discussed above 
purchases of available for sale securities were slightly lower during relative to although investable funds were available in for reinvestment due to the increase in proceeds from bond calls and maturities  as previously noted  the deployment of funds was hampered by the lack of available long term securities which met our investment objectives 
purchases of other investments decreased in compared to as a result of a decrease in funding of mortgage loans  partially offset by a slight increase in funding of tax credit partnerships 
purchases of other investments increased during relative to as a result of the funding of tax credit partnerships  as well as a slight increase in the funding of mortgage loans 
net purchases of short term investments decreased in compared to due to our use of cash to fund the payment for our debt maturing in and to also fund the repurchases of unum group common stock 
this decline in net purchases was partially offset by an increase in purchases of short term investments using cash received under our securities lending program 
net purchases of short term investments increased during relative to due to the increase in bond calls and maturities  with the proceeds invested in short term investments pending the purchase of fixed maturity securities 
financing cash flows financing cash flows consist primarily of borrowings and repayments of debt  issuance or repurchase of common stock  and dividends paid to stockholders 
net cash used by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million and million for and  respectively 
during  we made short term debt repayments of million at the maturity date of our remaining senior notes 
short term debt repayments in consist of the purchase and retirement of the remaining million of our notes and the repayment of million of reverse repurchase agreements 
during   and  tailwind holdings made principal payments of million each year on its floating rate  senior secured non recourse notes and northwind holdings made principal payments of million  million  and million  respectively  on its floating rate  senior secured non recourse notes 
long term debt repayments in also include the purchase and retirement of million of our medium term notes 
long term debt repayments in also include million aggregate principal of our medium term notes and million aggregate principal of our notes 
during  we received proceeds of million  less debt issuance costs of million and a debt discount of million  from the issuance of million of senior notes 
during  we received proceeds of million  less debt issuance costs of million  from the issuance of million of senior notes 
as of december   the amount outstanding under our securities lending program was million 
we did not utilize our securities lending program during and during and  we repurchased million and million shares of unum group s common stock at a cost of million and million  respectively 
see debt contained in this item and notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item for further information 
cash available from subsidiaries unum group and certain of its intermediate holding company subsidiaries depend on payments from subsidiaries to pay dividends to stockholders  to pay debt obligations  and or to pay expenses 
these payments by our insurance and non insurance subsidiaries may take the form of dividends  operating and investment management fees  and or interest payments on loans from the parent to a subsidiary 
restrictions under applicable state insurance laws limit the amount of dividends that can be paid to a parent company from its insurance subsidiaries in any month period without prior approval by regulatory authorities 
for life insurance companies domiciled in the united states  that limitation generally equals  depending on the state of domicile  either ten percent of an insurer s statutory surplus with respect to policyholders as of the preceding year end or the statutory net gain from operations  excluding realized investment gains and losses  of the preceding year 
the payment of dividends to a parent company from its insurance subsidiaries is generally further limited to the amount of unassigned statutory surplus 
unum group and or certain of its intermediate holding company subsidiaries may also receive dividends from its united kingdom based affiliate  unum limited  subject to applicable insurance company regulations and capital guidance in the united kingdom 
northwind holdings and tailwind holdings ability to meet their debt payment obligations is dependent upon the receipt of dividends from northwind reinsurance company northwind re and tailwind reinsurance company tailwind re  respectively 
the ability of northwind re and tailwind re to pay dividends to their respective parent companies will depend on their satisfaction of applicable regulatory requirements and on the performance of the business reinsured by northwind re and tailwind re 
the payment of dividends to the parent company from our subsidiaries also requires the approval of the individual subsidiary s board of directors 
the amount available during for the payment of ordinary dividends from unum group s traditional us insurance subsidiaries was million  of which million was declared and paid 
the amount available during from unum limited was million  of which million was declared and paid 
during  tailwind re and northwind re paid dividends of million and million to tailwind holdings and northwind holdings  respectively 
although we may not utilize the entire amount of available dividends  based on the restrictions under current law  million is available during for the payment of ordinary dividends to unum group from its traditional us insurance subsidiaries  which excludes northwind re and tailwind re  our special purpose financial captive insurance companies 
approximately million is available for the payment of dividends from unum limited to unum group and or our uk holding companies during  subject to regulatory approval 
unum group s rbc ratio for its traditional us insurance subsidiaries  calculated on a weighted average basis using the naic company action level formula  was approximately percent at the end of the individual rbc ratios for northwind re and tailwind re are calculated using the naic company action level formula and have target levels of percent 
the rbc ratios for northwind re and tailwind re each exceeded the percent target level at the end of the individual rbc ratio for each of our insurance subsidiaries is above the range that would require state regulatory action 
the ability of unum group and certain of its intermediate holding company subsidiaries to continue to receive dividends from their insurance subsidiaries generally depends on the level of earnings of those insurance subsidiaries and additional factors such as rbc ratios and fsa capital adequacy requirements  funding growth objectives at an affiliate level  and maintaining appropriate capital adequacy ratios to support desired ratings 
insurance regulatory restrictions do not limit the amount of dividends available for distribution from non insurance subsidiaries except where the non insurance subsidiaries are held directly or indirectly by an insurance subsidiary and only indirectly by unum group 
we intend to retain a level of capital in our traditional us insurance subsidiaries such that we maintain a weighted average rbc level above capital adequacy requirements 
we also expect unum limited to operate above fsa capital adequacy requirements and minimum solvency margins 
debt at december   we had short term debt of million  consisting entirely of securities lending agreements  and long term debt  including senior secured notes and junior subordinated debt securities  totaling  million 
our leverage ratio  when calculated using consolidated debt to total consolidated capital  was percent at december   compared to percent at december  our leverage ratio  when calculated excluding the non recourse debt and associated capital of tailwind holdings and northwind holdings and the short term debt arising from securities lending agreements  was percent at december   compared to percent at december  the increase in our consolidated debt to total consolidated capital leverage ratio is due primarily to the securities lending agreements outstanding at december   partially offset by the maturity of million of senior notes and our principal payments on the debt of northwind holdings and tailwind holdings during leverage is measured as total debt to total capital  which we define as total long term and short term debt plus stockholders equity  excluding the net unrealized gain or loss on securities and the net gain or loss on cash flow hedges 
we believe that a leverage ratio which excludes the net unrealized gains and losses on securities and the net gain or loss on cash flow hedges  both of which tend to fluctuate depending on market conditions and general economic trends  and which also excludes the non recourse debt and associated capital of tailwind holdings and northwind holdings and the short term debt arising from securities lending is a better indicator of our ability to meet our financial obligations 
we monitor our compliance with our debt covenants 
there are no significant financial covenants associated with any of our outstanding debt obligations 
we remain in compliance with all debt covenants and have not observed any current trends that would cause a breach of any debt covenants

northwind holdings ability to meet its payment obligations under the notes will be dependent principally upon its receipt of dividends from northwind re

see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item for additional information 
short term and long term debt includes contractual principal and interest payments and therefore exceeds the amount shown in the consolidated balance sheets 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item for additional information 
policyholder liability maturities and the related reinsurance recoverable represent the projected payout of the current in force policyholder liabilities and the expected cash inflows from reinsurers for liabilities ceded and therefore incorporate uncertainties as to the timing and amount of claim payments 
we utilize extensive liability modeling to project future cash flows from the in force business 
the primary assumptions used to project future cash flows are claim incidence rates for mortality and morbidity  claim resolution rates  persistency rates  and interest rates 
these cash flows are discounted to determine the current value of the projected claim payments 
the timing and amount of payments on policyholder liabilities may vary significantly from the projections above 
see our previous discussion of asset and liability management under investments contained in this item and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item for additional information 
pensions and other postretirement benefit obligations include our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans for our employees  including non qualified pension plans 
pension plan obligations  other than the non qualified plans  represent our expected contributions to the pension plans 
amounts in the one year or less category equal our expected contributions within the next months

miscellaneous liabilities include commissions due and accrued  deferred compensation liabilities  state premium taxes payable  amounts due to reinsurance companies  accounts payable  obligations to return unrestricted cash collateral to our derivatives counterparties  and various other liabilities that represent contractual obligations 
obligations where the timing of the payment was uncertain are included in the one year or less category 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item for additional information on our derivatives 
at december   we had legally binding unfunded commitments of million which are recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets  to fund tax credit partnership investments with a corresponding recognition of other long term investments 
these commitments are represented in the purchase obligation line on the preceding schedule and will be funded over the next several years 
off balance sheet arrangements as noted in the preceding commitments table  we have operating lease commitments totaling million at december  operating leases include noncancelable obligations on certain office space  equipment  and software 
purchase obligations include off balance sheet non binding commitments of million to fund certain of our investments in private placement securities  private equity partnerships  and other partnerships 
these are shown in the preceding table based on the expiration date of the commitments 
the funds will be due upon satisfaction of contractual notice from the partnership trustee or issuer of the private placement securities 
the amounts may or may not be funded 
also included are noncancelable obligations with outside parties for computer data processing services and related functions and software maintenance agreements 
the aggregate obligation remaining under these agreements was million at december  as part of our regular investing strategy  we receive collateral from unaffiliated third parties through transactions which include both securities lending and also short term agreements to purchase securities with the agreement to resell them at a later specified date 
for both types of transactions  we require that a minimum of percent of the fair value of the securities loaned or securities purchased under repurchase agreements be maintained as collateral 
generally  cash is received as collateral under these agreements 
in the event that securities are received as collateral  we are not permitted to sell or re post them 
we also post our fixed maturity securities as collateral to unaffiliated third parties through transactions including both securities lending and also short term agreements to sell securities with the agreement to repurchase them at a later specified date 
see transfers of financial assets as follows for further discussion 
to help limit the credit exposure of the derivatives  we enter into master netting agreements with our counterparties whereby contracts in a gain position can be offset against contracts in a loss position 
we also typically enter into bilateral  cross collateralization agreements with our counterparties to help limit the credit exposure of the derivatives 
these agreements require the counterparty in a loss position to submit acceptable collateral with the other counterparty in the event the net loss position meets or exceeds an agreed upon amount 
our current credit exposure on derivatives  which is limited to the value of those contracts in a net gain position less collateral held  was million at december  we post fixed maturity securities or cash as collateral to our counterparties 
the carrying value of fixed maturity securities posted as collateral to our counterparties was million at december  we had no cash posted as collateral to our counterparties at december  our derivatives counterparties have posted non cash collateral in various segregated custody accounts to which we have a security interest in the event of counterparty default 
this collateral  which is not reflected in the preceding table  had a fair value of million at december  transfers of financial assets to manage our cash position more efficiently  we enter into repurchase agreements with unaffiliated financial institutions 
we generally use repurchase agreements as a means to finance the purchase of invested assets or for short term general business purposes until projected cash flows become available from our operations or existing investments 
our repurchase agreements are typically outstanding for less than days 
we post collateral through our repurchase agreement transactions whereby the counterparty commits to purchase securities with the agreement to resell them to us at a later  specified date 
the fair value of collateral posted is generally percent of the cash received 
as previously noted  our investment policy also permits us to lend fixed maturity securities to unaffiliated financial institutions in short term securities lending agreements  which increase our investment income with minimal risk 
we account for all of our securities lending agreements and repurchase agreements as collateralized financings 
we had million of securities lending agreements outstanding which were collateralized by cash at december  and were reported as short term debt in our consolidated balance sheets 
the cash received as collateral was reinvested in short term investments 
the average balance during was million  and the maximum amount outstanding at any month end was million 
in addition  at december   we also had million of off balance sheet securities lending agreements which were collateralized by securities that we were neither permitted to sell nor control 
the average balance of these off balance sheet transactions during was million  and the maximum amount outstanding at any month end was million 
we had no repurchase agreements outstanding at december   nor did we utilize any repurchase agreements during our use of repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements can fluctuate during any given period and will depend on our liquidity position  the availability of long term investments that meet our purchasing criteria  and our general business needs 
ratings am best  fitch  moody s  and s p are among the third parties that assign issuer credit ratings to unum group and financial strength ratings to our insurance subsidiaries 
issuer credit ratings reflect an agency s opinion of the overall financial capacity of a company to meet its senior debt obligations 
financial strength ratings are specific to each individual insurance subsidiary and reflect each rating agency s view of the overall financial strength capital levels  earnings  growth  investments  business mix  operating performance  and market position of the insuring entity and its ability to meet its obligations to policyholders 
both the issuer credit ratings and financial strength ratings incorporate quantitative and qualitative analyses by rating agencies and are routinely reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis 
we compete based in part on the financial strength ratings provided by rating agencies 
a downgrade of our financial strength ratings can be expected to adversely affect us and could potentially  among other things  adversely affect our relationships with distributors of our products and services and retention of our sales force  negatively impact persistency and new sales  particularly large case group sales and individual sales  and generally adversely affect our ability to compete 
a downgrade in the issuer credit rating assigned to unum group can be expected to adversely affect our cost of capital or our ability to raise additional capital 
the table below reflects the issuer credit ratings for unum group and the financial strength ratings for each of our traditional insurance subsidiaries as of the date of this filing

a significant component of our communications involves our annual review meeting with each of the four agencies 
we hold other meetings throughout the year regarding our business  including  but not limited to  quarterly updates 
on january   am best upgraded its ratings of unum group and its domestic operating subsidiaries to bbb and a  respectively  with the exception of paul revere variable which retained its b rating  and revised the outlook for the company and its subsidiaries to stable

on august   s p affirmed the bbb credit rating of unum group and the a financial strength rating of its domestic subsidiaries and raised the outlook for the company and its domestic subsidiaries to positive 
there have been no other changes in any of the rating agencies outlook statements or ratings during or during prior to the date of this filing 
agency ratings are not directed toward the holders of our securities and are not recommendations to buy  sell  or hold our securities 
each rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization  and each rating should be regarded as an independent assessment  not conditional on any other rating 
given the dynamic nature of the ratings process  changes by these or other rating agencies may or may not occur in the near term 
based on our ongoing dialogue with the rating agencies concerning our improved insurance risk profile  our financial flexibility  our operating performance  and the quality of our investment portfolio  we do not expect any negative actions from any of the four rating agencies related to either unum group s current issuer credit ratings or the financial strength ratings of its insurance subsidiaries 
however  in the event that we are unable to meet the rating agency specific guideline values to maintain our current ratings  including but not limited to maintenance of our capital management metrics at the threshold values stated and maintenance of our financial flexibility and operational consistency  we could be placed on a negative credit watch  with a potential for a downgrade to both our issuer credit ratings and our financial strength ratings 
see ratings contained herein in item and risk factors contained herein in item a for further discussion 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to various market risk exposures  including interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk 
the following discussion regarding our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties 
estimates of future performance and economic conditions are reflected assuming certain changes in market rates and prices were to occur sensitivity analysis 
caution should be used in evaluating our overall market risk from the information presented below  as actual results may differ 
see investments contained herein in item and notes   and of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item for further discussions of the qualitative aspects of market risk  including derivative financial instrument activity 
interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate changes results from our holdings of financial instruments such as fixed rate investments  derivatives  and interest sensitive liabilities 
fixed rate investments include fixed maturity securities  mortgage loans  policy loans  and short term investments 
fixed maturity securities include us and foreign government bonds  securities issued by government agencies  corporate bonds  mortgage backed securities  and redeemable preferred stock  all of which are subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations 
certain of our financial instruments  fixed maturity securities and derivatives  are carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets 
the fair value of these financial instruments may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates 
a rise in interest rates may decrease the net unrealized gain related to these financial instruments  but may improve our ability to earn higher rates of return on new purchases of fixed maturity securities 
conversely  a decline in interest rates may increase the net unrealized gain  but new securities may be purchased at lower rates of return 
although changes in fair value of fixed maturity securities and derivatives due to changes in interest rates may impact amounts reported in our consolidated balance sheets  these changes will not cause an economic gain or loss unless we sell investments  terminate derivative positions  determine that an investment is other than temporarily impaired  or determine that a derivative instrument is no longer an effective hedge 
other fixed rate investments  such as mortgage loans and policy loans  are carried at amortized cost and unpaid balances  respectively  rather than fair value in our consolidated balance sheets 
these investments may have fair values substantially higher or lower than the carrying values reflected in our balance sheets 
a change in interest rates could impact our financial position if we sold our mortgage loan investments at times of low market value 
a change in interest rates would not impact our financial position at repayment of policy loans  as ultimately the cash surrender values or death benefits would be reduced for the carrying value of any outstanding policy loans 
carrying amounts for short term investments approximate fair value  and we believe we have minimal interest rate risk exposure from these investments 
we believe that the risk of being forced to liquidate investments or terminate derivative positions is minimal  primarily due to the level of capital at our insurance subsidiaries  the level of cash and marketable securities at our holding companies  and our investment strategy which we believe provides for adequate cash flows to meet the funding requirements of our business 
we may in certain circumstances  however  need to sell investments due to changes in regulatory or capital requirements  changes in tax laws  rating agency decisions  and or unexpected changes in liquidity needs 
although our policy benefits are primarily in the form of claim payments and we therefore have minimal exposure to the policy withdrawal risk associated with deposit products such as individual life policies or annuities  the fair values of liabilities under all insurance contracts are taken into consideration in our overall management of interest rate risk  which minimizes exposure to changing interest rates through the matching of investment cash flows with amounts due under insurance contracts 
changes in interest rates and individuals behavior affect the amount and timing of asset and liability cash flows 
we actively manage our asset and liability cash flow match and our asset and liability duration match to mitigate interest rate risk 
due to the long duration of our long term care product  we may be unable to purchase appropriate assets with cash flows and durations such that the timing and or amount of our investment cash flows may not match those of our maturing liabilities 
sustained periods of low interest rates could result in lower than expected profitability or increases in reserves 
we model and test asset and liability portfolios to improve interest rate risk management and net yields 
testing the asset and liability portfolios under various interest rate and economic scenarios allows us to choose what we believe to be the most appropriate investment strategy  as well as to prepare for disadvantageous outcomes 
this analysis is the precursor to our activities in derivative financial instruments 
we use current and forward interest rate swaps  options on forward interest rate swaps  and forward treasury locks to hedge interest rate risks and to match asset durations and cash flows with corresponding liabilities 
short term and long term debt are not carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets 
if we modify or replace existing short term or long term debt instruments at current market rates  we may incur a gain or loss on the transaction 
we believe our debt related risk to changes in interest rates is relatively minimal 
in the near term  we expect that our need for external financing is small  but changes in our business could increase our need 
we measure our financial instruments market risk related to changes in interest rates using a sensitivity analysis 
this analysis estimates potential changes in fair values as of december  and based on a hypothetical immediate increase of basis points in interest rates from year end levels 
the selection of a basis point immediate parallel change in interest rates should not be construed as our prediction of future market events  but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event 
the hypothetical potential changes in fair value of our financial instruments at december  and are shown as follows december  in millions of dollars notional amount of derivatives fair value hypothetical fv bp change in fv assets fixed maturity securities mortgage loans policy loans  net of reinsurance ceded liabilities unrealized adjustment to reserves  net of reinsurance ceded and other short term debt long term debt derivatives swaps embedded derivative in modified coinsurance arrangement december  in millions of dollars notional amount of derivatives fair value hypothetical fv bp change in fv assets fixed maturity securities mortgage loans policy loans  net of reinsurance ceded liabilities unrealized adjustment to reserves  net of reinsurance ceded and other short term debt long term debt derivatives swaps embedded derivative in modified coinsurance arrangement these assets and liabilities are carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets 
changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates may affect the fair value at which the item is reported in our consolidated balance sheets 
the corresponding offsetting change is reported in other comprehensive income or loss  net of deferred taxes  except for changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative which is reported as a component of net realized investment gain or loss 
the adjustment to reserves and other for unrealized investment gains and losses reflects the adjustments to deferred acquisition costs and policyholder liabilities that would be necessary if the unrealized investment gains and losses related to the fixed maturity securities and derivatives had been realized 
changes in this adjustment are also reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss  net of deferred taxes 
the effect of a change in interest rates on asset prices was determined using a duration implied methodology for corporate bonds and government and government agency securities whereby the duration of each security was used to estimate the change in price for the security assuming an increase of basis points in interest rates 
the effect of a change in interest rates on the mortgage backed securities was estimated using a mortgage analytic system which takes into account the impact of changing prepayment speeds resulting from a basis point increase in interest rates on the change in price of the mortgage backed securities 
these hypothetical prices were compared to the actual prices for the period to compute the overall change in market value 
the changes in the fair values shown in the chart above for all other items were determined using discounted cash flows analyses 
because we actively manage our investments and liabilities  actual changes could be less than those estimated above 
as previously discussed in item  in response to the significant decline in interest rates  we have lowered the discount rate on our long term care product to reflect the low interest rate environment and our expectation of future investment portfolio yield rates 
we will continue to monitor these issues in accordance with the policies set forth above to ensure appropriate management of these prevailing risks 
foreign currency risk the functional currency of our uk operations is the british pound sterling 
we are exposed to foreign currency risk arising from fluctuations in the british pound sterling to us dollar exchange rates primarily as they relate to the translation of the financial results of our uk operations 
fluctuations in the pound to dollar exchange rate have an effect on our reported financial results 
we do not hedge against the possible impact of this risk 
because we do not actually convert pounds into dollars except for a limited number of transactions  we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting issue and not a reflection of operations or profitability in the uk assuming the pound to dollar exchange rate decreased percent from the december  and levels  stockholders equity as reported in us dollars as of and for the periods then ended would have been lower by approximately million and million  respectively 
assuming the pound to dollar average exchange rate decreased percent from the actual average exchange rates for and  segment operating income  which excludes net realized investment gains and losses and income tax  as reported in us dollars would have decreased approximately million and million  respectively  for the years then ended 
dividends paid by unum limited are generally held at our uk finance subsidiary or our uk holding company 
if these funds are repatriated to our us holding company  we would at that time be subject to foreign currency risk as the value of the dividend  when converted into us dollars  would be dependent upon the foreign exchange rate at the time of conversion 
we are also exposed to foreign currency risk related to certain foreign investment securities denominated in local currencies and us dollar denominated debt issued by one of our uk subsidiaries 
we use current and forward currency swaps to hedge or minimize the foreign exchange risk associated with these instruments 
see unum uk segment contained herein in item for further information concerning foreign currency translation 
risk management effectively taking and managing risks is essential to the success of our company 
to facilitate this effort  we have a formal enterprise risk management erm program  with a framework comprising the following key components risk culture and governance risk appetite policy risk identification and prioritization risk and capital modeling risk management activities risk reporting through adherence to the objectives highlighted by the key components of our erm framework  we believe we are better positioned to fulfill our corporate mission  improve and protect stockholder value  and reduce reputational risk 
risk culture and governance we employ a decentralized risk management model under which risk based decisions are made daily on a local level 
to achieve long term success  we believe risk management must be the responsibility of all employees 
the individual and collective decisions of our employees play a key role in successfully managing our overall risk profile 
we strive for a culture of accountability  risk management  and strict compliance  and we believe these values allow our employees to feel comfortable identifying issues as well as taking ownership for addressing potential problems 
our risk culture is reinforced by our system of risk governance 
we employ a multi layered risk control system 
our three lines of defense model is depicted below 
st line the business nd line risk and control rd line independent review all unum employees risk committees and chief risk officer internal audit and internal controls frontline business management chief actuary audit committee of unum group board compliance officers and staff unum group board business units are primarily responsible for managing their principal risks 
our risk committees  chief risk officer cro  chief actuary  and compliance officers and staff serve in risk and control functions responsible for providing risk oversight  or the second line of risk control 
the internal audit team and internal controls team provide a second level of independent review  or our third line of risk control 
the audit committee of unum group s board of directors the board oversees the entire erm governance process  effectively providing independent review for our third line of risk control 
the board has an active role  as a whole and through its committees  in overseeing management of our risks 
the board is responsible for managing strategic risk and regularly reviews information regarding our capital  liquidity  and operations  as well as the risks associated with each  and receives an erm report from our cro at least annually  or more frequently as appropriate 
the audit committee of the board is responsible for oversight of our risk management process  including financial risk  operational risk  and any other risk not specifically assigned to another board committee 
the cro provides a report on our risks and risk management processes to the audit committee of the board at least quarterly 
the finance committee of the board is responsible for oversight of risks associated with investments and related financial matters 
the human capital committee of the board is responsible for oversight of risks relating to our compensation plans and programs 
the cro performs an annual risk assessment of our incentive compensation programs to ensure incentive plans are balanced and consistent with the risk levels embedded in our financial and business plans 
results of this assessment are presented to our human capital committee of the board annually  and conclusions from this assessment are reported in our proxy statement 
the regulatory compliance committee of the board is responsible for oversight of risks related to regulatory  compliance  policy  and legal matters  both current and emerging  and whether of a local  state  federal  or international nature 
while each committee is responsible for evaluating certain risks and overseeing the management of such risks  the entire board is regularly informed through committee reports about such risks in addition to the risk information it receives directly 
the executive risk management committee is responsible for overseeing our enterprise wide risk management program 
the cro  who is a member of the executive risk management committee  has primary responsibility for our erm program and is supported by corporate risk committees and by the risk committees of our three primary operating segments 
operating segment risk committees for unum us  unum uk  and colonial life are responsible for oversight of risks specific to their businesses 
these committees are responsible for identifying  measuring  reporting  and managing insurance and operational risks within their respective areas  consistent with enterprise risk management guidance 
corporate risk committees oversee the operational  global technology services  investment  and capital management risks on a corporate level 
risk appetite policy our risk appetite policy describes the types of risks we are willing to take  as well as the amount of enterprise risk exposure we deem acceptable in pursuit of our goals  with an objective of clearly defining boundaries for our risk taking activities 
the starting point of our philosophy and approach to our erm strategy is our corporate strategy 
in contrast to many multi line peer companies  we do not offer retirement savings  traditional medical benefits  or property and casualty insurance 
our corporate strategy is focused on providing group  individual  and voluntary benefits  either as stand alone products or combined with other coverages  that create comprehensive benefits solutions for employers 
we have market leadership positions in the product lines we offer and have over years of experience 
we believe this combination of focused expertise and extensive experience is a competitive advantage that forms the foundation of our approach to risk management 
our sound and consistent business practices  strong internal compliance program  and comprehensive risk management strategy enable us to operate efficiently as well as to identify and address potential areas of risk in our business 
we take and manage risks to achieve our business and strategic objectives  and our risk appetite statement sets boundaries for risk taking activities that link earnings  capital  and operational processes  as well as summarizes our most material risk limits and controls 
we monitor our risk profile against our established risk tolerance and limits 
risks falling outside our risk tolerance and limits are reported to the applicable governance group  where decisions are made pertaining to acceptance of the risk or implementation of remediation plans or corrective actions as deemed appropriate by that governance group 
risk identification and prioritization risk identification and prioritization is an ongoing process  whereby we identify and assess our risk positions and exposures  including notable risk events 
additionally  we identify emerging risks and analyze how material future risks might affect us 
knowing the potential risks we face allows us to monitor and manage their potential effects including adjusting our strategies as appropriate and holding capital levels which provide financial flexibility 
risk committees have primary responsibility for identifying and prioritizing risks within their respective areas 
in addition  we maintain a risk  ethics  and compliance rec leaders program 
the goal of the program is to further embed rec management into our culture in a visible and effective manner 
this group assists with the early identification of issues  timely referrals  problem solving  and communication 
individual employees can report material concerns and identified risks through a variety of options  such as discussion with management  contacting a rec leader or the erm team  or utilizing the company s anonymous hotline and electronic reporting mechanism 
we face a wide range of risks  and our continued success depends on our ability to identify and appropriately manage our risk exposures 
for additional information on certain risks that may adversely affect our business  operating results  or financial condition see cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements included below the table of contents and risk factors contained herein in item a 
risk and capital modeling we assess material risks  including how they affect us and how individual risks interrelate  to provide valuable information to management in order that they may effectively manage our risks 
we use qualitative and quantitative approaches to assess existing and emerging risks and to develop mitigating strategies to limit our exposure to both 
we utilize stress testing and scenario analysis for risk management and to shape our business  financial  and strategic planning activities 
both are key components of our risk appetite policy and play an important role in monitoring  assessing  managing  and mitigating our primary risk exposures 
in particular  stress testing of our capital and liquidity management strategies enables us to identify areas of high exposure  assess mitigating actions  develop contingency plans  and guide decisions around our target capital and liquidity levels 
for example  we periodically perform stress tests on certain categories of assets or liabilities to support development of capital and liquidity risk contingency plans 
these tests help ensure that we have a buffer to support our operations in uncertain times and financial flexibility to respond to market opportunities 
stress testing is also central to reserve adequacy testing  cash flow testing  and asset and liability management 
in addition  we aim to constantly improve our capital modeling techniques and methodologies that are used to determine a level of capital that is commensurate with our risk profile and to ensure compliance with evolving regulatory and rating agency requirements 
our capital modeling reflects appropriate aggregation of risks and diversification benefits resulting from our mix of products and business units 
our internal capital modeling and allocation aids us in making significant business decisions including strategic planning  capital management  risk limit determination  reinsurance purchases  hedging activities  asset allocation  pricing  and corporate development 
risk management activities we accept and manage strategic  credit  and insurance risks in accordance with our corporate strategy  investment policy  and annual business plans 
the following fundamental principles are embedded in our risk management efforts across our company 
we believe in the benefits of specialization and a focused business strategy 
we seek profitable risk taking in areas where we have established risk management skills and capabilities 
we seek to manage our exposure to insurance risk through a combination of prudent underwriting with effective risk selection  maintaining pricing discipline  sound reserving practices  and high quality claims management 
detailed underwriting guidelines and claim policies are tools used to manage our insurance risk exposure 
we also monitor exposures against internally prescribed limits and practice diversification to reduce potential concentration risk and volatility 
we maintain a detailed set of investment policies and guidelines  including fundamental credit analysis  that are used to manage our credit risk exposure and diversify our risks across asset classes and issuers 
finally  we foster a risk culture that embeds our corporate values and our code of conduct in our daily operations and preserves our reputation with customers and other key stakeholders 
we monitor a composite set of operational risk metrics that measure operating effectiveness from the customer perspective 
risk reporting regular internal and external risk reporting is an integral part of our erm framework 
internally  erm reports are a standard part of our quarterly senior management and board meetings 
the reports summarize our existing and emerging risk exposures  as well as report against the tolerances and limits defined by our risk appetite policy 
externally  we are subject to a number of regulatory and rating agency risk examinations  and risk reports are often included 
domestic and international regulators are currently completing requirements for a new own risk and solvency assessment orsa standard  which is intended to become a regular part of reviews of insurers erm programs 
orsa is expected to provide strong evidence of the strengths of our erm framework  measurement approaches  key assumptions utilized in assessing our risks  and prospective solvency assessments under both normal and stressed conditions 
during  we will implement actions to prepare for compliance with this evolving standard
