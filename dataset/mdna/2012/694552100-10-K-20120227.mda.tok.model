pacific mercantile bank  et al  filed in january   in the california superior court for the county of orange case no 

as previously reported in our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended september   this lawsuit was filed by plaintiff asserting that the bank had wrongfully exercised certain remedies in its efforts to recover borrowings owed by plaintiff to the bank under i a million construction loan which was secured by a first trust deed on real property owned by plaintiff  and ii a  unsecured line of credit 
plaintiff also maintained deposit accounts with the bank 
plaintiff failed to repay outstanding borrowings of approximately  due at the maturity date of his line of credit in april when plaintiff refused demands to repay those borrowings  the bank set off that amount against plaintiff s deposit accounts in accordance with the express terms of his line of credit agreement with the bank 
plaintiff also failed to repay his construction loan when it matured in august and  in october  the bank commenced foreclosure proceedings against the real property collateralizing that loan 
in his lawsuit  plaintiff claimed that the set off by the bank against plaintiff s deposit accounts was wrongful based on allegations that the bank had i agreed to extend the line of credit and breached that agreement when it exercised its set off rights  and ii failed to provide him with prior notice of the set off and an opportunity to cure his default under the line of credit 
plaintiff also asserted certain related claims  including an alleged breach by the bank of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing 
the case was tried before a jury in august  however  as we reported in our third quarter q  i before the case went to the jury for a decision  the trial judge ruled that the bank had wrongfully exercised its set off rights and based on that finding  the jury awarded plaintiff  of compensatory damages  and ii the jury later found that the bank s exercise of its set off rights also constituted a wrongful conversion of plaintiff s funds and as a result  that the plaintiff also was entitled to awards of  in compensatory damages and million in punitive damages against the bank 
in response to a proposed statement of decision submitted to the trial judge by plaintiff following the jury verdict  the bank asserted that the judge s ruling with respect to the bank s set off rights and the jury s findings with respect 
table of contents to plaintiff s claims of wrongful conversion were erroneous and that  as a result  plaintiff was not entitled  as a matter of law  to an award of either compensatory or punitive damages 
the bank also asserted that if the trial judge were to determine that plaintiff was entitled to punitive damages  the million punitive damage award  which was nearly times the  compensatory damage award for conversion  was excessive as a matter of california law  which provides that punitive damage awards may range from one to four times the amount of compensatory damages 
nevertheless  the trial judge initially sustained the plaintiff s statement of decision 
the bank then filed motions with the court for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict and  in the alternative  for a new trial  as well as a motion to vacate the findings set forth in the statement of decision 
a hearing on these motions was held on february  the court thereafter rejected the bank s motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict and  while it sustained the rulings on compensatory damages  the trial court ruled that the jury s punitive damage award was excessive and that the bank s motion for a new trial would be granted  unless the plaintiff agreed to accept a reduction in the punitive damage award from million to  on february  we learned that the plaintiff had agreed to accept that reduction in the punitive damage award and a final judgment has been entered against the bank in the amount of million 
in addition  the trial court entered an award to plaintiff of his attorneys fees and costs  in the amount of  following the entry of the final judgment by the trial court  the bank filed an appeal of the trial court s rulings and the jury verdict  asserting that those rulings and the jury s verdict were erroneous and that plaintiff is not entitled  as a matter of law  to an award of either compensatory or punitive damages 
because the appeals process has just begun  it is not possible at this time to predict  with any certainty  how the appellate courts will ultimately rule on our appeal 
however  we believe that the judgment entered by the court against the bank will be overturned on appeal 
other legal actions 
we are subject to legal actions that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business 
currently there are no such pending legal proceedings that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

dividend policy and share repurchase programs our board of directors has followed the policy of retaining earnings to maintain capital and  thereby  support the growth of the company s banking franchise 
on occasion  the board also considered paying cash dividends out of cash generated in excess of those capital requirements and  in february  the board of directors declared a cash dividend  in the amount of per share of common stock  that was paid on march  the board also authorized share repurchase programs in june and in october  when the board concluded that  at the then prevailing market prices  the company s shares represented an attractive investment opportunity and  therefore  that share repurchases would be a good use of company funds 
in the first quarter of  the board of directors decided that the prudent course of action  in light of the economic recession  was to preserve cash and earnings to enhance the bank s capital position and to be in a position to take advantage of improved economic and market conditions in the future 
in addition  in august  both the bank and the company entered into a written agreement with the frb  their primary federal banking regulator  and the dfi  the bank s state banking regulator  issued a regulatory order the dfi order imposing restrictions on the company and the bank 
the frb agreement and dfi order  among other things  prohibits the payment of cash dividends and share repurchases without the approval of the 
table of contents frb and the dfi 
see item business supervision and regulation pacific mercantile bancorp regulatory action taken by the frb and the dfi 
accordingly  we do not expect to pay cash dividends or make share purchases at least for the foreseeable future 
restrictions on the payment of dividends cash dividends from the bank represent the principal source of funds available to the bancorp  which it might use to pay cash dividends to shareholders or for other corporate purposes  such as expansion of its business 
therefore  government regulations  including the laws of the state of california  as they pertain to the payment of cash dividends by california state chartered banks  limit the amount of funds that the bank would be permitted to dividend to the bancorp 
as a result  those laws also affect the ability our to pay cash dividends to our shareholders or fund other expenditures 
in particular  under california law  cash dividends by a california state chartered bank may not exceed  in any calendar year  the lesser of i the sum of its net income for the year and its retained net income from the preceding two years after deducting all dividends paid during the period  or ii the amount of its retained earnings 
moreover  as a california corporation  the company s ability to pay cash dividends is subject to restrictions under the california corporations code 
those restrictions provide that a california corporation may pay a cash dividend a if the amount of the dividend does not exceed the sum of the corporation s retained earnings plus ii the amount  if any  of dividends in arrears on shares which have preferential dividend rights over the rights of shareholders that will be receiving the dividend  or b if  immediately after the dividend is paid  the greater of the book or fair value of the corporation s assets equals or exceeds the sum of i its total liabilities plus ii the liquidation preference of any shares which have a preference upon dissolution over the rights of shareholders receiving the dividend 
additionally  because the payment of cash dividends has the effect of reducing capital  the capital requirements imposed on bank holding companies and commercial banks often operate  as a practical matter  to preclude the payment  or limit the amount of  cash dividends that might otherwise be permitted by california law  and the federal bank regulatory agencies  as part of their supervisory powers  generally require insured banks to adopt dividend policies which limit the payment of cash dividends much more strictly than do applicable state laws 
as previously discussed above  we are prohibited from paying cash dividends to shareholders without the prior approval of the frb and the dfi 
moreover  we have had to defer interest payments on junior subordinated debentures that we issued in and as a result of restrictions contained in the frb agreement 
under the terms of those debentures  we may not pay cash dividends on our common stock or preferred stock unless and until we have paid all of the deferred interest in full and thereafter make interest payments on the debentures as and when they become due 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation contractual obligations junior subordinated debentures in item of this report for additional information regarding the junior subordinated debentures 
accordingly  we do not expect to pay cash dividends for at least the foreseeable future 
the shares of our series b preferred stock are entitled to receive dividends payable in cash at a rate of per annum if  as and when declared by the board of directors 
if  however  due to legal or regulatory restrictions  such as the dividend restrictions under california law or under the frb agreement  the company is unable to pay cash dividends on the series b preferred stock for two semi annual dividend periods  then the company will be required to pay such dividends in shares of series c preferred stock 
the issuance of shares of series c preferred stock would be dilutive of the ownership that our existing common shareholders have in the company 
in addition  no dividends may be declared or paid on shares of the company s common stock unless dividends are first paid either in cash or in shares of series c preferred stock on the shares of series b preferred stock and any shares of series c preferred stock that may have been issued and are then outstanding 
restrictions on inter company transactions section a of the federal reserve act limits the amounts that a bank may loan to its bank holding company to an aggregate of no more than of the bank subsidiary s capital surplus and retained earnings and requires that such loans be secured by specified assets of the bank holding company see business supervision and regulation restrictions on transactions between the bank and the company and its other affiliates

due to those risks and uncertainties  our future financial performance may differ  possibly significantly  from the performance that is currently expected as set forth in the forward looking statements

background the following discussion presents information about our consolidated results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and capital resources and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in item of this report 
our principal operating subsidiary is pacific mercantile bank the bank  which is a california state chartered bank and a member of the federal reserve system 
the bank accounts for substantially all of our consolidated revenues and income and assets and liabilities 
accordingly  the following discussion focuses primarily on the bank s operations and financial condition 
overview of fiscal operating results the following table sets forth selected financial information comparing our results of operations for the fiscal year ended december  to our results of operations in the years ended december  and year ended december  amount amount percent change amount percent change vs

in we were able to reduce the provisions we made for loan losses by million  or  as compared to  primarily as a result of declines in net loan charge offs  loan delinquencies and total loans outstanding and an increase in recoveries of previously charged off loans 
although that reduction in the provisions made for loan losses resulted in a reduction in the amount of the allowance for loan losses at december   as compared to december   the ratio of the allowance to total loans outstanding at december  remained substantially unchanged at  as compared to at december  due to the reduction in the provisions made for loan losses  net interest income after the provisions for loan losses increased by nearly million  or  to million in  as compared to million in 
table of contents increase in noninterest income 
noninterest income increased in by approximately million  or  to million  from million in that increase was due primarily to a million  or  increase in our mortgage banking revenue  which was attributable to a substantial increase in the volume of mortgage loans that we originated and sold into the secondary mortgage market 
that increase in mortgage banking revenues was partially offset by a million  or  decrease in gains on sales of securities in as compared to pre tax income 
due primarily to the reduction in the provisions made for loan losses and the increase in noninterest income  we generated pre tax income of million in  an improvement of million  or  from a pre tax loss of million in income tax benefit 
in we recorded a non cash income tax benefit of million as a result of a million reduction in a million valuation allowance that we had established in previous years by means of non cash charges against the our deferred tax assets  including charges of million and million to the provision for income taxes in and  respectively 
those charges were taken as a result of determinations we made in and that  due to economic recession and the loan losses and net losses we were then incurring  it had become more likely  than not  that we would not be able to use the tax benefits which comprised our deferred tax asset to offset or reduce income taxes in future periods 
in the fourth quarter of we determined  on the basis of a strengthening of the economy  an improvement in the quality of our loan portfolio and an increase in our earnings  that it had become more likely  than not  that we would be able to use approximately million of the tax benefits comprising our deferred tax asset to offset or reduce income taxes in future periods 
as a result  we reduced the valuation allowance by a corresponding amount and recognized the million tax benefit for see critical accounting policies deferred tax asset below 
partially offsetting the increase in our net interest income  after the provision for loan losses  and the increase in our non interest income was a  or  increase in noninterest expense in  as compared to that increase was primarily due to increases in compensation expense and in the carrying costs of other real estate owned and a provision made for contingencies  which were partially offset by reductions in fdic insurance expense and professional fees 
set forth below are certain key financial performance ratios and other financial data for or at the end of the periods indicated year ended december  return on average assets return on average shareholders equity ratio of average equity to average assets net interest margin net interest income expressed as a percentage of total average interest earning assets 
changes in financial condition in decrease in the allowance for loan losses 
as previously noted  we decreased the allowance for loan losses to million  or of loans outstanding at december   from million  or of loans outstanding at december   due primarily to declines in total loans outstanding at december  as compared to december  and reductions in net loan charge offs and loan delinquencies during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  reduction in outstanding borrowings 
during  we used available cash to reduce our outstanding federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings to million at december  comprised of million in short term borrowings and million in long term borrowings 
by comparison  our fhlb borrowings at december  totaled million  comprised of million of short term borrowings and million of long term borrowings 
this decrease in fhlb borrowings contributed to the reduction in our interest expense in the year ended december  
table of contents change in mix of deposits to a greater proportion of lower costs deposits 
during  the volume of non interest bearing and lower cost deposits increased to and the volume of higher costs certificates of deposits decreased to  in each case as a percentage of total deposits  from and  respectively  at december  that change in the mix of deposits contributed to a decline in interest expense during fiscal see financial condition deposits below in this item increase in shareholder s equity and improvement in capital ratios 
shareholders equity at december  totaled million  an increase of million  or  from million at december  that increase was primarily attributable to the million in net earnings in  and the sale  in august  of million of series b convertible preferred stock the series b preferred shares 
as a result  the consolidated book value of our common stock increased to per share at december  from per share at december  due to this increase in shareholders equity  the ratio of our consolidated total capital to risk weighted assets which is the principal federal regulatory measure of the financial strength of banking institutions increased to at december   from at december  as a result  we continued to exceed the highest of the capital standards that are applicable to bank holding companies under federal banking regulations 
we contributed the net proceeds from the sale of the million of series b preferred stock to the bank to enable it to increase the ratio of its adjusted tangible shareholders equity to its tangible assets above  as required under a regulatory order issued by the department of financial institutions the dfi in august see capital resources below in this item critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap and accounting practices in the banking industry 
certain of those accounting policies are considered critical accounting policies  because they require us to make estimates and assumptions regarding circumstances or trends that could materially affect the value of those assets  such as economic conditions or trends that could impact our ability to fully collect our loans or ultimately realize the carrying value of certain of our other assets 
those estimates and assumptions are made based on current information available to us regarding those economic conditions or trends or other circumstances 
if changes were to occur in the events  trends or other circumstances on which our estimates or assumptions were based  or other unanticipated events were to occur that might affect our operations  we may be required under gaap to adjust our earlier estimates and to reduce the carrying values of the affected assets on our balance sheet  generally by means of charges against income  which could also affect our results of operations in the fiscal periods when those charges are recognized 
our critical accounting policies relate to the determinations of our allowance for loan losses  the fair values of securities available for sale and the realizability  and hence the valuation  of our deferred tax asset 
allowance for loan losses 
like virtually all banks and other financial institutions  we follow the practice of maintaining an allowance to provide for possible loan losses that occur from time to time as an incidental part of the banking business 
the accounting policies and practices we follow in determining the sufficiency of that allowance  which is commonly referred to as the allowance for loan losses or the all require us to make judgments and assumptions about economic and market conditions and trends that can affect the ability of our borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations to us 
in making those judgments  we use historical loss factors  adjusted for current economic and market conditions  other economic indicators and applicable bank regulatory guidelines  to determine losses inherent in our loan portfolio and the sufficiency of our allowance for loan losses 
if unanticipated changes were to occur in those conditions or trends  or the financial condition of borrowers was to deteriorate  actual loan losses could be greater than those that had previously been predicted 
in such events  or if there were changes to the loss factors or regulatory guidelines on which we had based our determinations regarding the sufficiency of the allowance  it could become necessary for us to increase the allowance for loan losses by means of a charge to income referred to in our financial statements as the provision for loan losses 
such an increase would reduce the carrying value of the loans on our balance sheet  and the provisions made for loan losses to increase that allowance would reduce our income in the period when it is determined that an increase in the allowance for loan losses is necessary 
during the fourth quarter of  federal bank regulatory agencies adopted new and more stringent guidelines and methodologies for identifying losses in bank loan portfolios and determining the sufficiency of loan loss reserves  as a result of the worsening of the economic recession and the prospects that conditions would not soon improve 
we have been applying those new guidelines and methodologies since the fourth quarter of see the discussion in the subsections entitled provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses and nonperforming loans below 
fair value of securities available for sale 
under applicable accounting principles  we are required to recognize any unrealized loss on the securities we hold for sale 
such an unrealized loss occurs when the fair value of a security held for sale declines below the amortized cost of the security as recorded on our balance sheet 
as a result  we make determinations  
table of contents on a quarterly basis  of the fair values of the securities in order to determine if there are any unrealized losses in our portfolio of the securities we hold for sale 
when there is an active market for a security  the determination of its fair value is based on market prices 
in the case of securities for which there is not an active trading market  but which do trade from time to time  we rely primarily on quotes we obtain from third party vendors and securities brokers to determine the fair values of those securities 
however  quotes are not always available for some securities and  in order to make determinations of fair value in those instances  it becomes necessary for us to make determinations of fair value based primarily on a variety of industry standard pricing methodologies  such as discounted cash flow analyses  matrix pricing  and option adjusted spread models  as well as fundamental analysis of the creditworthiness of the obligors under those securities 
these methodologies require us to make various assumptions relating to such matters as future prepayment speeds  yield  duration  federal reserve board monetary policies and the supply and demand for the individual securities 
consequently  if changes were to occur in market or other conditions on which our earlier assumptions or judgments were based  it could become necessary for us to reduce the fair values of such securities  which would result in charges to accumulated other comprehensive income loss on our balance sheet 
moreover  if we conclude that reductions in the fair values of any securities are other than temporary  it would be necessary for us to recognize an impairment loss to noninterest income in our statement of operations 
utilization and valuation of deferred income tax benefits 
we record as a deferred tax asset on our balance sheet an amount equal to the tax credit and tax loss carryforwards and tax deductions tax benefits that we believe will be available to us to offset or reduce income taxes in future periods 
under applicable federal and state income tax laws and regulations  such tax benefits will expire if they cannot be used within specified periods of time 
accordingly  the ability to fully use our deferred tax asset to reduce income taxes in the future depends on the amount of taxable income that we generate during those time periods 
at least once each year  or more frequently  if warranted  we make estimates of future taxable income that we believe we are likely to generate during those future periods 
if we conclude  on the basis of those estimates and the amount of the tax benefits available to us  that it is more likely  than not  that we will be able to fully utilize those tax benefits prior to their expiration  we recognize the deferred tax asset in full on our balance sheet 
on the other hand  if we conclude on the basis of those estimates and the amount of the tax benefits available to us that it has become more likely  than not  that we will be unable to utilize those tax benefits in full prior to their expiration  then  we would establish or increase any existing valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax asset on our balance sheet to the amount with respect to which we believe it is still more likely  than not  that we will be able to use to offset or reduce taxes in the future 
the establishment or an increase in that valuation allowance is implemented by recognizing a non cash charge that would have the effect of increasing the provision  or reducing any credit  for income taxes that we would otherwise have recorded in our statements of operations 
the determination of whether and the extent to which we will be able to utilize our deferred tax asset involves significant judgments and assumptions that are subject to period to period changes as a result of changes in tax laws  changes in market or economic conditions that could affect our operating results or variances between our actual operating results and our projected operating results  as well as other factors 
we conducted an assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax asset as of june  based on that assessment and due  in part  to continued weakness in the economy and financial markets  we then concluded that it had become more likely  than not  that we would be unable to utilize our remaining tax benefits comprising our deferred tax asset prior to their expiration 
therefore  we recorded a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset in the amount of million by means of a million non cash charge to income tax expense in the quarter ended june  the provision for income taxes we recorded in our statement of operations of nearly million for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to that charge 
we conducted another assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax asset in the fourth quarter of  due to a strengthening of economic conditions  an improvement in the quality of our loan portfolio  as reflected in declines in loan losses and loan delinquencies  and the earnings we were generating from operations 
based on that assessment  we determined that it had become more likely  than not  that we would be able to use approximately million of the income tax benefits comprising our deferred tax asset to offset or reduce taxes in future years 
as a result we reduced  by a corresponding amount  the valuation allowance that we had established against our deferred tax asset during the two years ended december   by recording a non cash income tax benefit for in the amount of million 
results of operations net interest income one of the principal determinants of a bank s income is its net interest income  which is the difference between i the interest that a bank earns on loans  investment securities and other interest earning assets  on the one hand  and ii its interest expense  which consists primarily of the interest it must pay to attract and retain deposits and the interest that it pays on borrowings and other interest bearing liabilities  on the other hand 
a bank s interest income and interest expense  in turn  are affected by a number of factors  some of which are outside of its control  including national and local economic conditions and the monetary policies of the federal reserve board which affect interest rates  the demand for loans by prospective borrowers  the competition among banks and other lending institutions for loans and deposits and the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations 
net interest income  when expressed as a percentage of total average interest earning assets  is a banking organization s net interest margin 
fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  our net interest income increased by  or  to million  from million in fiscal that increase was primarily attributable to a million  or  decline in interest expense  substantially offset by a million  or  decrease in interest income in  as compared to the 
table of contents decline in interest expense was due primarily to reductions in market rates of interest  as a result of which the average rate of interest that we paid on our interest bearing liabilities declined to in from in also contributing  to a lesser extent  to the decline in interest expense in was a million reduction in average borrowings outstanding and a change in the mix of our deposits to a higher proportion of lower cost core deposits and a lower proportion of higher cost certificates of deposits 
the decline in interest income was primarily attributable to the federal reserve board s reductions in interest rates  which reduced the yields that we were able to realize on our loans and investments and  to a lesser extent  to a decline in average loans outstanding  in as compared to our net interest margin for fiscal increased to  from in fiscal  because of the aforementioned decrease in interest expense  which was primarily the result of i a decrease in the average interest rate paid on time deposits to in from in  ii a change in the mix of deposits to a higher proportion of lower cost core deposits and a lower average volume and a lower proportion of higher cost certificates of deposit  iii a decrease in the average interest rate that we paid on our borrowings to in  from in  and iv a decrease in average borrowings outstanding in as compared to fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  our net interest income increased by million  or  to million  from million in fiscal that increase was primarily attributable to an million  or  decline in interest expense  which more than offset a  or  decrease in interest income in  as compared to the decline in interest expense was due primarily to continuing interest rate reductions implemented by the federal reserve board in response to the economic recession  which i enabled us to reduce the rates at which we paid interest on time deposits  and ii led to declines in the interest rates charged on our borrowings 
as a result  the average rate of interest that we paid on our interest bearing liabilities in declined to from in also contributing  to a lesser extent  to the decline in interest expense was a million reduction  during  in average borrowings outstanding 
the decline in interest income also was primarily attributable to the federal reserve board s reductions in interest rates  which reduced the yields that we were able to realize on our loans and investments in and more than offset the positive effect on interest income of a modest increase in the volume of loans outstanding during our net interest margin for fiscal increased to  from in fiscal  because of the aforementioned decrease in interest expense  which was primarily the result of i a decrease in the average interest rate paid on time deposits to in from in  and ii a decrease in the average interest rate that we paid on our borrowings to in  from in and iii to a lesser extent  the decrease in average borrowings outstanding in as compared to

table of contents the following table sets forth changes in interest income  including loan fees  and interest paid in each of the years ended december   and and the extent to which those changes were attributable to changes in i the volumes of or in the rates of interest earned on interest earning assets and ii the volumes of or in the rates of interest paid on our interest bearing liabilities

stock consists of federal reserve bank stock and federal home loan bank stock 
the above table indicates that the  increase in net interest income in was primarily attributable to declines in the volume of and in the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  which more than offset decreases in the volume and yields on interest earning assets 
the decrease in interest paid during was due primarily to i reductions in the rates of interest on certificates of deposit and on borrowings  ii a reduction in outstanding federal home loan bank borrowings and iii a change in the mix of deposits to a greater proportion of non interest bearing and lower cost core deposits and a lower proportion of higher cost certificates of deposits 
in  the million increase in net interest income was almost entirely the result of a decline in the rates at which we paid interest on interest bearing liabilities and  to a much lesser extent  a decline in the volume of interest bearing liabilities 
provision for loan losses like virtually all banks and other financial institutions  we follow the practice of maintaining a reserve or allowance for possible loan losses that occur in banking 
when it is determined that the payment in full of a loan has become unlikely  the carrying value of the loan is reduced written down to what management believes is its realizable value or  if it is determined that a loan no longer has any realizable value  the carrying value of the loan is written off in its entirety a loan charge off 
loan charge offs and write downs are charged against that allowance the allowance for loan losses or the all 
the amount of the all is adjusted periodically i to replenish the all after it has been reduced due to loan write downs and charge offs  ii to reflect increases in the volume of outstanding loans  and iii to take account of changes in the risk of potential loan losses due to a deterioration in the condition of borrowers or in the value of property securing non performing loans or adverse changes in economic conditions 
see financial condition nonperforming loans and the allowance for loan losses below in this item increases in the all are made through a charge  recorded as an expense in the statement of operations  referred to as the provision for loan losses 
the all is sometimes decreased as a result of reductions in the volume of loans outstanding  a decline in loan charge offs and delinquencies or recoveries of loans previously charged off 
recoveries of loans that were previously charged off are added back to the all and  therefore  have the effect of increasing the all and reducing the amount of the provisions that we might otherwise have had to make to replenish or increase the all 
we employ economic and loss migration models that are based on bank regulatory guidelines  industry standards and our own historical loan loss experience  as well as a number of more subjective qualitative factors  to determine both the 
table of contents sufficiency of the all and the amount of the provisions that need to be made for potential loan losses 
however  those determinations involve judgments about trends in current economic conditions and other events that can affect the ability of borrowers to meet their loan obligations to us and a weighting among the quantitative and qualitative factors we consider in determining the amount of the all 
moreover  the duration and anticipated effects of prevailing economic conditions or trends can be uncertain and can be affected by number of risks and circumstances that are outside of our ability to control 
see the discussion above in item a of this report under the caption risk factors we could incur losses on the loans we make and the discussion below in this item under the caption financial condition nonperforming loans and the allowance for loan losses 
if changes in economic or market conditions or unexpected subsequent events were to occur  or if changes were made to bank regulatory guidelines or industry standards that are used to assess the sufficiency of the all  it could become necessary to incur additional  and possibly significant  charges to increase the allowance for loan losses  which would have the effect of reducing our income or causing us to incur losses 
in addition  the frb and the dfi  as an integral part of their examination processes  periodically review the adequacy of our all 
these agencies may require us to make additional provisions for possible loan losses  over and above the provisions that we have already made  the effect of which would be to reduce our income or increase any losses we might incur 
in  we reduced the all by million  or  to million at the end of december   compared to million at the end of december   which is reflected as a reversal of  to the provision for loan losses in our statement of operations 
nevertheless  the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans  which was at december   remained substantially unchanged at as of december  moreover  that ratio is consistent with the ratios of the bank s peer group  comprised of banks with total assets between million and billion 
the reduction in the all was primarily attributable to i a reduction in loan charge offs to million in from million in  ii a million  or  decline in loan delinquencies to approximately million at december  as compared to approximately million at december   and iii a million  or  reduction in gross loans outstanding to million at december  from million at december  in  we recorded million in provisions for loan losses i to provide for increases in non performing loans and net loan write downs and charge offs totaling nearly million in as compared to  and ii to increase the allowance for loan losses after giving effect to those loan charge offs and write downs  to approximately million at december  from million at december   due primarily to the sluggishness in the economy  continuing increases in unemployment and further declines in real property values  which combined to create considerable uncertainties regarding economic conditions and to increase the risk that loan delinquencies would remain high

table of contents compared to in  noninterest expense increased by  or  as compared to that increase was primarily the result of a million  or  increase in compensation expense  due primarily to increased staffing required by the growth of our mortgage banking operations  and provisions of million made to establish a reserve for litigation and other contingencies 
those increases were substantially offset by a million  or  decrease in fdic insurance assessments and a  or  decrease in professional fees  which consisted primarily of legal fees and expenses incurred principally in connection with the collection and foreclosures of non performing loans and loan restructurings 
compared to the million or  increase in noninterest expense in was primarily attributable to i a million increase in fdic insurance assessments  due to a substantial increase in such assessments by the fdic on all federally insured depository institutions in order to replenish the bank insurance fund which had been depleted by bank failures  ii a  increase in expenses incurred in connection with real properties acquired from borrowers on or in lieu of foreclosures  and iii a  increase in professional fees  primarily due to increased legal fees and costs incurred as a result of legal proceedings to recover amounts due by defaulting borrowers  to foreclose real properties and other assets securing non performing loans  and to implement loan restructurings for those borrowers who demonstrated an ability to meet their loan obligations on extended or modified terms 
these increases were partially offset by a  decrease in salaries and employee benefits resulting from expense reduction initiatives implemented in income tax expense benefit we recorded a non cash income tax benefit of million in as a result of a million reduction in the valuation allowance we had established against our deferred tax asset by means of charges to the provision for income taxes in prior years 
the reduction in the valuation allowance was based on an assessment we made in the fourth quarter of that  due to a strengthening of economic conditions  an improvement in the quality of our loan portfolio  as reflected in declines in loan losses and loan delinquencies  and the earnings we were generating from operations  it had become more likely  than not  that we would be able to use approximately million of the income tax benefits comprising our deferred tax asset to offset or reduce taxes in future periods 
in  we recognized a non charge of million to the provision for income taxes in order to increase the valuation allowance we had previously established against our deferred tax asset by million 
that increase was the result of a determination that we made in the second quarter of that  due to the continuing weakness of the economy  the uncertainties about the strength of the economic recovery and our continuing losses  it had become more likely  than not  that we would be unable to use the remainder of our deferred tax asset to offset or reduce income taxes in future periods

we adopted asc effective april  and  accordingly  we recognize other than temporary impairments in available for sale debt securities 
accordingly  when there are credit losses associated with an impaired debt security and i we do not have the intent to sell the security and ii it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell the security before the recovery of its cost basis  then  we will separate the amount of impairment that is credit related from the amount thereof that is related to non credit factors

a non credit related impairment is recognized and reflected in other comprehensive income loss 
through the impairment assessment process  we determined that the investments set forth below were other than temporarily impaired otti at december  we recorded impairment credit losses of  on available for sale securities in our statement of operations for the year ended december  the otti related to factors other than credit losses  in the aggregate amount of million  was recognized as other comprehensive loss in our balance sheet at december

as a part of our otti assessment process with respect to securities held for sale with unrealized losses  we consider available information about i the performance of the collateral underlying each such security  including credit enhancements  ii historical prepayment speeds  iii delinquency and default rates  iv loss severities  v the age or vintage of the security  and iv rating agency reports on the security 
significant judgments are required with respect to these and other factors in order to make a determination of the future cash flows that can be expected to be generated by the security 
based on our otti assessment process  we determined that there were two different investment securities in our portfolio of securities held for sale that had become or were impaired as of december  an asset backed security  and a non agency collateralized mortgage obligation a cmo 
asset backed security 
at december   we had one asset backed security in our portfolio of investment securities available for sale in an original face amount of million  which we purchased at a price of for a total purchase price of  in november this security was part of a total issuance of an aggregate of million face amount of these securities  which are multi class  cash flow collateralized bond obligations backed by a pool of trust preferred securities issued by a diversified group of issuers  comprised of us depository institutions and insurance companies 
the security that we own cusip cae is the mezzanine class b piece that floats with month libor basis points and had a rating of aa aa by moody s and fitch at the time of issuance 
as of december   the book value of this security was million with a fair value of  for an approximate unrealized loss of million 
currently  the security has a ca rating from moody s and cc rating from fitch and has experienced million in defaults of total current collateral and million in interest deferrals representing of total current collateral from issuance to december  we are not currently accruing interest on this security and we estimate that that the security could experience another million in defaults before the holders of this security would not receive all of the contractual cash flows from this security 
this estimate  arrived at by means of our impairment analysis  is based on the following assumptions future default rates of  prepayment rates of until maturity  and recovery of future defaults 
we recognized impairment losses in earnings on this security of   and  in the years ended december   december   and december   respectively 
non agency cmo 
through our impairment analysis  we identified one non agency collateralized mortgage obligation security a cmo with respect to which we recognized otti at december  this cmo is a super senior support bond  which was originally issued in  was then rated aaa by standard poor s and aa by moody s  and had a credit support of of the total balance at issuance 
as of december   the security was rated bbb and caa by standard and poor s and moody s  respectively  and was determined to have a fair value of  as compared to an amortized cost of  resulting in an unrealized loss of approximately  the cmo is collateralized by a pool of one to four family  fully amortizing residential first mortgage loans that bear interest at a fixed rate for approximately five years  after which they bear interest at variable rates with annual resets 
at december    credit support underlying this cmo was approximately and delinquencies days and over totaled approximately 
factors considered in determining that this security was impaired included the changes in the 
table of contents ratings of the security  the current level of subordination from other cmo classes  anticipated prepayment rates  cumulative default rates and the loss severity in the event of a default 
based on our impairment assessment and analysis  we recorded no impairment charge in our statement of operations in in respect of this security  because we concluded that this loss was attributable to non credit factors  such as external market conditions  the limited liquidity of the security and risks of potential additional declines in the housing market 
accordingly  the unrealized loss on this security  of  was recognized as other comprehensive loss on our balance sheet at december  year ended december  in thousands impairment losses on otti securities asset backed security non agency cmo total impairment loss recognized in earnings we have made a determination that the remainder of our securities with respect to which there were unrealized losses as of december  are not other than temporarily impaired  because we have concluded that we have the ability to continue to hold those securities until their respective fair market values increase above their respective amortized costs or  if necessary  until their respective maturities 
in reaching that conclusion  we considered a number of factors and other information  which included the significance of each such security in terms of i the amount of the unrealized losses attributable to each such security  ii our liquidity position  iii the impact that retention of those securities could have on our capital position and iv our evaluation of the expected future performance of these securities based on the criteria discussed above 
loans held for sale we commenced a new mortgage banking business during the second quarter of to originate  primarily in southern california  residential real estate mortgage loans that qualify for resale into the secondary mortgage markets 
our mortgage originations have been primarily for the financing of purchases of residential property and  to a lesser extent  refinancing of existing residential mortgage loans 
in addition to conventional mortgage loans  we offer loan programs for low to moderate income families that qualify for mortgage assistance  such as the fhlb s wish program  homepath financing on fannie mae repossessed homes  and southern california home financing authority and various mortgage assistance programs in counties and cities within our branch network

non performing loans consist of i loans on non accrual status which are loans on which the accrual of interest has been discontinued and include restructured loans when there has not been a history of past performance on debt service in accordance with the contractual terms of the restructured loans  and ii loans days or more past due and still accruing interest 
non performing assets are comprised of non performing loans and other real estate owned  or oreo  which consists of real properties which have been acquired by foreclosure or similar means and which we intend to offer for sale 
loans are placed on non accrual status when  in the opinion of management  the full timely collection of principal or interest is in doubt 
generally  the accrual of interest is discontinued when principal or interest payments become more than days past due  unless we believe the loan is adequately collateralized and the loan is in the process of collection 
however  in certain instances  we may place a particular loan on non accrual status earlier  depending upon the individual circumstances involved in loan s delinquency 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  previously accrued but unpaid interest is reversed against current income 
subsequent collections of unpaid amounts on such a loan are applied to reduce principal when received  except when the ultimate collectability of principal is probable  in which case interest payments are credited to income 
non accrual loans may be restored to accrual status if and when principal and interest become current and full repayment is expected 
interest income is recognized on the accrual basis for impaired loans not meeting the criteria for non accrual treatment

table of contents the following table sets forth information  at december  and  with respect to the amounts  determined in accordance with asc  of impaired loans for which specific reserves have been set aside within the allowance for loan losses  the amounts of those reserves and the amounts of impaired loans for which no specific reserves have been allocated within the allowance for loan losses december  december  impaired loans loans reserves for loan losses of reserves to loans loans reserves for loan losses of reserves to loans dollars in thousands impaired loans with specific reserves impaired loans without specific reserves total impaired loans allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses the allowance at december  was million  as compared to million at december  as a percentage of total loans outstanding  the allowance at december  was  compared to at december  the adequacy of the allowance is determined through periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio and other factors that can reasonably be expected to affect the ability of borrowers to meet their loan obligations 
those factors are inherently subjective as the process for determining the adequacy of the allowance involves some significant estimates and assumptions about such matters as i the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows of borrowers  ii the fair value of the collateral securing non performing loans  iii estimates of losses that we may incur on non performing loans  which are determined on the basis of historical loss experience and industry loss factors and bank regulatory guidelines  which are subject to change  and iv various qualitative factors 
since those factors are subject to changes in economic and other conditions and changes in regulatory guidelines or other circumstances over which we have no control  the amount of the allowance may prove in the future to be insufficient to cover all of the loan losses we might incur in the future 
in such an event  it may become necessary for us to increase the allowance from time to time to maintain its adequacy 
such increases are effectuated by means of a charge to income  referred to as the provision for loan losses  in our statement of our operations 
see results of operations provision for loan losses  above in this item the amount of the allowance is first determined by assigning reserve ratios for all loans 
all non accrual loans and other loans classified as special mention  substandard or doubtful classified loans or classification categories are then assigned certain allocations according to type of loans  with greater reserve ratios or percentages applied to loans deemed to be of a higher risk 
these ratios are determined based on prior loss history and industry guidelines and loss factors  by type of loan  adjusted for current economic factors 
on a quarterly basis  we utilize a classification migration model and individual loan review analysis tools as starting points for determining the adequacy of the allowance 
our loss migration analysis tracks a certain number of quarters of loan loss history and industry loss factors to determine historical losses by classification category for each loan type  except certain loans automobile  mortgage and credit cards  which are analyzed as homogeneous loan pools 
these calculated loss factors are then applied to outstanding loan balances 
we also conduct individual loan review analysis  as part of the allowance allocation process  applying specific monitoring policies and procedures in analyzing the existing loan portfolios 
in determining whether and the extent to which we will make adjustments to our loan loss migration model for purposes of determining the allowance  we also consider a number of qualitative factors that can affect the performance and the collectability of the loans in our loan portfolio 
such qualitative factors include the effects of changes that we may make in our loan policies or underwriting standards on the quality of the loans and the risks in our loan portfolios  trends and changes in local  regional and national economic conditions  as well as changes in industry specific conditions  and any other reasonably foreseeable events that could affect the performance or the collectability of the loans in our loan portfolios  material changes that may occur in the mix or in the volume of the loans in our loan portfolios that could alter  whether positively or negatively  the risk profile of those portfolios  changes in management or loan personnel or other circumstances that could  either positively or negatively  impact the application of our loan underwriting standards  the monitoring of nonperforming loans or our loan collection efforts  
table of contents changes in the concentration of risk in the loan portfolio  and external factors that  in addition to economic conditions  can affect the ability of borrowers to meet their loan obligations  such as fires  earthquakes and terrorist attacks 
determining the effects that these qualitative factors may have on the performance of our loan portfolios requires numerous judgments  assumptions and estimates about conditions  trends and events which may subsequently prove to have been incorrect due to circumstances outside of our control 
moreover  the effects of qualitative factors such as these on the performance of our loan portfolios are often difficult to quantify 
as a result  we may sustain loan losses in any particular period that are sizable in relation to the allowance or that may even exceed the allowance 
in response to the economic recession  which has resulted in increased and relatively persistent high rates of unemployment  and the credit crisis that has led to a severe tightening in the availability of credit  preventing borrowers from refinancing their loans  we have i implemented more stringent loan underwriting standards  ii strengthened loan underwriting and approval processes and iii added personnel with experience in addressing problem assets

we project the future sources and uses of funds and maintain liquid funds for unanticipated events 
our primary sources of cash include cash we have on deposit at other financial institutions  payments on loans  proceeds from the sale or maturity of securities  and from sales of residential mortgage loans  increases in deposits and increases in borrowings principally from the federal home loan bank 
the primary uses of cash include funding new loans and making advances on existing lines of credit  purchasing investments  including securities available for sale  funding new residential mortgage loans  funding deposit withdrawals and paying operating expenses 
we maintain funds in overnight federal funds and other short term investments to provide for short term liquidity needs 
we also have obtained credit lines from the federal home loan bank and other financial institutions to meet any additional liquidity requirements 
our liquid assets  which included cash and due from banks  federal funds sold  interest earning deposits with financial institutions and unpledged securities available for sale excluding federal reserve bank and federal home loan bank stock totaled million  which represented of total assets  at december  
table of contents cash flow used in operating activities 
in  we used net cash of million in operating activities  comprised primarily of million in originations of mortgage loans held for sale  which more than offset million of proceeds generated from sales of mortgage loans available for sale 
cash flow provided by investing activities 
investing activities provided net cash of million  primarily attributable to million of proceeds from sales of securities available for sale  million of loan repayments  and million of proceeds from sales of other real estate owned  partially offset by million of purchases of securities available for sale 
cash flow used by financing activities 
in  we used net cash of million in financing activities  consisting of million to reduce borrowings  which was substantially offset by a million increase in deposits and the net proceeds  totaling nearly million  from the sale of shares of series b preferred stock in a private placement which we completed in august ratio of loans to deposits 
the relationship between gross loans and total deposits can provide a useful measure of a bank s liquidity 
since repayment of loans tends to be less predictable than the maturity of investments and other liquid resources  the higher the loan to deposit ratio the less liquid are our assets 
on the other hand  since we realize greater yields on loans than we do on investments  a lower loan to deposit ratio can adversely affect interest income and earnings 
as a result  our goal is to achieve a loan to deposit ratio that appropriately balances the requirements of liquidity and the need to generate a fair return on our assets 
at december   the loan to deposit ratio was  down from  at december   primarily as a result of an increase in deposits and a decline in the volume of loans outstanding in off balance sheet arrangements loan commitments and standby letters of credit 
in order to meet the financing needs of our customers in the normal course of business  we make commitments to extend credit and issue standby commercial letters of credit to or for our customers 
at december  and  we had outstanding commitments to fund loans totaling approximately million and million  respectively 
commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and the customer may be required to pay a fee and meet other conditions in order to draw on those commitments or standby letters of credit 
we expect  based on historical experience  that many of the commitments will expire without being drawn upon and  therefore  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
to varying degrees  commitments to extend credit involve elements of credit and interest rate risk for us that are in excess of the amounts recognized in our balance sheets 
our maximum exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the customers to whom such commitments are made could potentially be equal to the amount of those commitments 
as a result  before making such a commitment to a customer  we evaluate the customer s creditworthiness using the same underwriting standards that we would apply if we were approving loans to the customer 
in addition  we often require the customer to secure its payment obligations for amounts drawn on such commitments with collateral such as accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment  income producing commercial properties  residential properties and properties under construction 
as a consequence  our exposure to credit and interest rate risk on such commitments is not different in character or amount than risks inherent in the outstanding loans in our loan portfolio 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the bank to guarantee a payment obligation of a customer to a third party 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan commitments to customers 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalent resources  together with available borrowings under our credit facilities  will be sufficient to enable us to meet any increases in demand for loans or in the utilization of outstanding loan commitments or standby letters of credit and any increase in deposit withdrawals that might occur in the foreseeable future 

table of contents contractual obligations borrowings 
as of december   we had million of outstanding short term borrowings and million of outstanding long term borrowings that we had obtained from the federal home loan bank 
the following table sets forth the amounts in thousands of dollars of  the interest rates we pay on  and the maturity dates of these federal home loan bank borrowings 
these borrowings  along with the securities sold under agreements to repurchase  had a weighted average annualized interest rate of during principal amounts interest rate maturity dates principal amounts interest rate maturity dates dollars in thousands dollars in thousands  february   november   february   february   august   august   september  at december   us agency and mortgage backed securities  us government agency securities and collateralized mortgage obligations with an aggregate fair market value of million and million of residential mortgage and other real estate secured loans were pledged to secure these federal home loan bank borrowings  repurchase agreements  local agency deposits and treasury  tax and loan accounts 
the highest amount of borrowings outstanding at any month end in consisted of million of borrowings from the federal home loan bank and million of overnight borrowings in the form of securities sold under repurchase agreements 
by comparison  the highest amount of borrowings outstanding at any month end in consisted of million of borrowings from the federal home loan bank and million of overnight borrowings in the form of securities sold under repurchase agreements 
junior subordinated debentures 
pursuant to rulings of the federal reserve board  bank holding companies were permitted to issue long term subordinated debt instruments that  subject to certain conditions  would qualify as and  therefore  augment capital for regulatory purposes 
at december   we had outstanding approximately million principal amount of year junior subordinated floating rate debentures the debentures  of which million qualified as tier capital for regulatory purposes as of december  see discussion below under the subcaption capital resources regulatory capital requirements 
set forth below is certain information regarding the debentures original issue dates principal amount interest rates maturity dates september  libor plus september october  libor plus october total subject to the receipt of prior regulatory approval  we may redeem the debentures  in whole or in part  without premium or penalty  at any time prior to maturity 
interest on the debentures is payable quarterly 
however  subject to certain conditions  we have the right  which we exercised during  to defer those interest payments for up to five years 
as previously reported  since july we have been required to obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve bank of san francisco the federal reserve bank to make interest payments on the debentures 
during the quarter ended september   we were advised by the federal reserve bank that it would not approve the payment of interest on the debentures and  as a result  during the twelve months ended december  we have had to exercise our interest deferral rights to defer the payment of a total of four quarterly interest payments on the debentures due in september and in october  respectively 
we cannot predict when the federal reserve bank will approve the resumption by us of interest payments on the debentures and  until we are able to obtain such approval  we will have to continue to deferring such payments 
since we have the right  under the terms of the debentures  to defer interest payments for up to five years  the deferral of interest payments to date did not  and any deferral of interest payments in will not  constitute a default under or with respect to the debentures

table of contents capital resources capital regulatory requirements applicable to banking institutions 
under federal banking regulations that apply to all united states based bank holding companies and federally insured banks  the company on a consolidated basis and the bank on a stand alone basis must meet specific capital adequacy requirements that  for the most part  involve quantitative measures  primarily in terms of the ratios of their capital to their assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items  calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
under those regulations  which are based primarily on those quantitative measures  each bank holding company must meet a minimum capital ratio and each federally insured bank is determined by its primary federal bank regulatory agency to come within one of the following capital adequacy categories on the basis of its capital ratios 
well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized  or critically undercapitalized certain qualitative assessments also are made by a banking institution s primary federal regulatory agency that could lead the agency to determine that the banking institution should be assigned to a lower capital category than the one indicated by the quantitative measures used to assess the institution s capital adequacy 
at each successive lower capital category  a banking institution is subject to greater operating restrictions and increased regulatory supervision by its federal bank regulatory agency 
the following table sets forth the capital and capital ratios of the company on a consolidated basis and the bank on a stand alone basis at december   as compared to the respective regulatory requirements applicable to them 
applicable federal regulatory requirement actual to be adequately capitalized to be well capitalized amount ratio amount ratio amount ratio total capital to risk weighted assets company   at least n a n a bank   at least  at least tier capital to risk weighted assets company   at least n a n a bank   at least  at least tier capital to average assets company   at least n a n a bank   at least  at least at december  the bank on a stand alone basis continued to qualify as a well capitalized institution  and the company continued to exceed the minimum required capital ratios applicable to it  under the capital adequacy guidelines described above 
the consolidated total capital and tier capital of the company  at december   includes an aggregate of million principal amount of junior subordinated debentures that we issued in and we contributed the net proceeds from the sales of the junior subordinated debentures to the bank over the six year period ended december   thereby providing it with additional cash to fund the growth of its banking operations and  at the same time  to increase its total capital and tier capital 
additional capital requirements under frb agreement and dfi order 
on august   the members of the respective boards of directors of the company and the bank entered into the frb agreement and the bank consented to the issuance of the dfi order 
the principal purposes of the frb agreement and the dfi order  which constitute formal supervisory actions by the frb and the dfi  were to require us to adopt and implement formal plans and take certain actions  as well as to continue implementing measures that we previously adopted  to address the adverse consequences that the economic recession has had on the performance of our loan portfolio and our operating results and to increase our capital to strengthen our ability to weather any further adverse conditions that might arise if the improvement in the economy does not remains sluggish or economic condition worsen 

table of contents the agreement and order contain substantially similar provisions 
they required the boards of directors of the company and the bank to prepare and submit written plans to the frb and the dfi to address a number of matters  including improving the bank s position with respect to problem assets  maintaining adequate reserves for loan losses in accordance with applicable supervisory guidelines  and improving the capital position of the bank and  in the case of the frb agreement  the capital position of the company 
the bank is also prohibited from paying dividends to the company without the prior approval of the dfi  and without the prior approval of the frb the company may not declare or pay cash dividends  repurchase any of its shares  make interest or principal payments on its debentures or incur or guarantee any debt 
the company and the bank already have made substantial progress with respect to several of these requirements and both the board and management are committed to achieving all of the requirements on a timely basis 
however  a failure by the company or the bank to meet any of the requirements of the frb agreement or a failure by the bank to meet any of the requirements of the dfi order could be deemed  by the frb or the dfi  to be conducting business in an unsafe manner which could subject the company or the bank to further regulatory enforcement action 
the frb agreement also required us to submit a capital plan to the frb that would meet with its approval and then implement that plan 
under the dfi order  the bank was required to achieve a ratio of adjusted tangible shareholders equity to its tangible assets to by january   by raising additional capital  generating earnings or reducing the bank s tangible assets subject to a limitation on such a reduction or a combination thereof and  upon achieving that ratio  to thereafter maintain that ratio during the term of the order 
in august  the company completed the sale of million of series b convertible series b preferred stock  the net proceeds from which it contributed to the bank  thereby increasing its ratio of adjusted tangible shareholders equity to its tangible assets to  as required by the dfi order 
at december   that ratio had increased to

we then contributed the net proceeds from the sale of those shares of series b preferred shares to the bank to enable it to increase the ratio of its adjusted tangible shareholders equity to its tangible assets above and thereby meet the capital requirement under the dfi order 
agreements to sell additional series b shares and shares of common stock 
in order to provide additional capital to be able to fund and support the resumption of our growth strategy  on august  we also entered into i an additional series b purchase agreement with sbav and the carpenter funds which provides for the sale by us  subject to satisfaction of certain conditions  of a total of million of additional shares of series b preferred stock  million of which is to be sold to the carpenter funds and the other million of which is to be sold to sbav the additional series b shares  at the same purchase price and on the same terms as the million of series b shares were sold to sbav and the carpenter funds on august   and ii a common stock purchase agreement with the carpenter funds which provides for the sale by us  subject to satisfaction of certain conditions  of a total of million of shares of our common stock to the carpenter funds 
the common stock purchase agreement provides for the shares of common stock to be sold to the carpenter funds at a price equal to the greater of per common share or the book value of the company s common stock as determined from the company s most recent periodic report filed with the sec prior to the closing of the sale of those shares 
additionally  the company will be issuing common stock purchase warrants the warrants that  subject to certain conditions  will entitle the carpenter funds and sbav to purchase up to  and  shares  respectively  of the company s common stock at a price of per share 
if these sales of the additional series b shares and common shares are consummated  the carpenter funds will own approximately of the company s voting securities and will be the company s largest shareholder 
consummation of the sales of the additional series b shares and those common shares is subject to a number of conditions including  in addition to customary conditions  the receipt of regulatory approvals required to be obtained by the carpenter funds for its purchases of the additional series b shares and the common shares and the achievement by the bank of certain specified capital ratios 
there is no assurance that these remaining conditions will be satisfied and  if any of the conditions fails to be satisfied  the additional series b purchase agreement and the common stock purchase agreement may be terminated by the carpenter funds  sbav or us 
in the event of such a termination  the sales of the additional series b shares and common shares contemplated by those agreements would not be consummated

table of contents dividend policy and share repurchase programs 
our board of directors has followed the policy of retaining earnings to maintain capital and  thereby  support the operations of the bank 
on occasion  the board has considered paying cash dividends out of cash generated in excess of those capital requirements and  in february  the board of directors declared a one time cash dividend  in the amount of per share of common stock  which was paid on march  to our shareholders 
in  the board of directors decided that the prudent course of action  in light of the economic recession  was to preserve cash to enhance the bank s capital position and to be in a position to take advantage of improved economic and market conditions in the future 
moreover  the frb agreement prohibits our payment of cash dividends and any repurchases of shares of our common stock  without the prior approval of those regulatory agencies 
in addition  the frb agreement prohibits us from making interest payments on our junior subordinated debentures without the approval of the frb 
as described above  we have been unable to obtain those approvals and  consequently  we have had to defer interest payments on those debentures 
as a result  we are precluded  by the terms of those debentures  from paying cash dividends on our common stock or preferred stock unless and until we have paid all of the deferred interest in full and thereafter make interest payments on the junior subordinated debentures as and when they become due 
accordingly  we do not expect to pay cash dividends or make share purchases at least for the foreseeable future 
the shares of series b preferred stock are entitled to receive dividends payable in cash at a rate of per annum if  as and when declared by the board of directors 
if  however  due to legal or regulatory restrictions  the company is unable to pay cash dividends on the series b preferred stock for two semi annual dividend periods  then the company will be required to pay such dividends in shares of series c preferred stock 
the issuance of shares of series c preferred stock would be dilutive of the ownership that our existing shareholders have in the company 
in addition  no dividends may be declared or paid on shares of the company s common stock unless dividends are first paid either in cash or in shares of series c preferred stock on the shares of series b preferred stock and any shares of series c preferred stock that may be issued in the future
