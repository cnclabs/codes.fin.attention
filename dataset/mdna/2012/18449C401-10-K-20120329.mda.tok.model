item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition and  as a result  our company s the legal acquirer consolidated financial statements are now those of csi the accounting acquirer  with the assets and liabilities  and revenues and expenses  of cdti included effective from october   the date of the closing of the merger 
for information regarding cdti s financial condition and results of operations as well as cdti s financial statements and related notes thereto reflecting cdti s business as a stand alone company for periods prior to the merger  please see our annual report on form k for the year ended december  and our quarterly reports on form q for periods prior to the closing of the merger 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our annual consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  the accuracy of which involves risks and uncertainties  see cautionary statement concerning forward looking statements 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  as a result of many important factors  including the consolidation of cdti for periods after october  all percentage amounts and ratios in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations were calculated using the underlying data in thousands 
overview we are a leading global manufacturer and distributor of heavy diesel and light duty vehicle emissions control systems and products to major automakers and retrofitters 
our emissions control systems and products are designed to deliver high value to our customers while benefiting the global environment through air quality improvement  sustainability and energy efficiency 
our business is driven by increasingly stringent global emission standards for internal combustion engines  which are major sources of a variety of harmful pollutants 
in light of the merger  we now organize our operations in two business divisions the heavy duty diesel systems division and the catalyst division 
we have included all of the operations of cdti in our heavy duty diesel systems division effective from the date of the closing of the merger 
heavy duty diesel systems through our heavy duty diesel systems division we design and manufacture verified exhaust emissions control solutions 
our heavy duty diesel systems division offers a full range of products for the verified retrofit and original equipment manufacturer  or oem  markets through its distribution dealer network and direct sales 
these ecs and clean diesel technologies branded products  such as purifilter  purifier  aris and exhaust gas recirculation with selective catalytic reduction are used to reduce exhaust emissions created by on road  off road and stationary diesel and alternative fuel engines including propane and natural gas 
revenues from our heavy duty diesel systems division accounted for approximately and of the total consolidated revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
catalyst through our catalyst division  we produce catalyst formulations to reduce emissions from gasoline  diesel and natural gas combustion engines that are offered for multiple markets and a wide range of applications 
a family of unique high performance catalysts has been developed with base metals or low platinum group metal and zero platinum group metal content to provide increased catalytic function and value for technology driven automotive industry customers 
our technical and manufacturing competence in the light duty vehicle market is aimed at meeting auto makers most stringent requirements  and we have supplied over ten million parts to light duty vehicle customers since our catalyst division also provides catalyst formulations for our heavy duty diesel systems division 
revenues from our catalyst division accounted for approximately and of the total consolidated revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
sources of revenues and expenses revenues we generate revenues primarily from the sale of our emission control systems and products 
we generally recognize revenues from the sale of our emission control systems and products upon shipment of these products to our customers 
however  for certain customers  where risk of loss transfers at the destination typically the customer s warehouse  revenue is recognized when the products are delivered to the destination which is generally within five days of the shipment 

table of contents cost of revenues cost of revenues consists primarily of direct costs for the manufacture of emission control systems and products  including cost of raw materials  costs of leasing and operating manufacturing facilities and wages and benefits paid to personnel involved in production  manufacturing quality control  testing and supply chain management 
in addition  cost of revenues include normal scrap and shrinkage associated with the manufacturing process and a expense from write down of obsolete and slow moving inventory 
we include the direct material costs and factory labor as well as factory overhead expense in the cost of revenue 
indirect factory expense includes the costs of freight inbound and outbound for direct material and finished goods  purchasing and receiving  inspection  testing  warehousing  utilities and deprecation of facilities and equipment utilized in the production and distribution of products 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist of our selling and marketing expenses  as well as our general and administrative expenses 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation paid to sales and marketing personnel  and marketing expenses 
costs related to sales and marketing are expensed as they are incurred 
these expenses include the salary and benefits for the sales and marketing staff as well as travel  samples provided at no cost to customers and marketing materials 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation paid to administrative personnel  legal and professional fees  corporate expenses and regulatory fees  bad debt and other administrative expenses 
these expenses include the salary and benefits for management and administrative staff as well as travel 
also included is any depreciation related to assets utilized in the selling  marketing and general and administrative functions as well as amortization of acquired intangible assets 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of costs associated with research related to new product development and product enhancement expenditures 
research and development costs also include costs associated with getting our heavy duty diesel systems verified and approved for sale by the epa  the carb and other regulatory authorities 
these expenses include the salary and benefits for the research and development staff as well as travel  research materials  testing and legal expense related to patenting intellectual property 
also included is any depreciation related to assets utilized in the development of new products 
recapitalization expenses recapitalization expense consists primarily of the expense for legal  accounting and other advisory professional services as a result of our efforts in to explore strategic opportunities resulting in the merger 
total other income expense total other income expense primarily reflects interest expense  including amortization of debt issuance costs and  in  amortization of non cash interest expense related to the secured convertible notes issued by csi in june  as well as changes in the fair value of our liability classified warrants 
it also includes loss on foreign exchange  interest income and our share of income and losses from our asian investment 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures in the financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that may be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and that have a material impact on financial condition or operating performance 
while we base our estimates and judgments on our experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements require significant judgments and estimates 
for additional information relating to these and other accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition we generally recognize revenue when products are shipped and the customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  and the sales price is fixed or determinable 
where installation services  if provided  are essential to the functionality of the equipment  we defer the portion of revenue for the sale attributable to installation until we have completed the 
table of contents installation 
when terms of sale include subjective customer acceptance criteria  we defer revenue until the acceptance criteria are met 
concurrent with the shipment of the product  we accrue estimated product return reserves and warranty expenses 
critical judgments include the determination of whether or not customer acceptance criteria are perfunctory or inconsequential 
the determination of whether or not the customer acceptance terms are perfunctory or inconsequential impacts the amount and timing of the revenue that we recognize 
critical judgments also include estimates of warranty reserves  which are established based on historical experience and knowledge of the product 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts involves estimates based on management s judgment  review of individual receivables and analysis of historical bad debts 
we monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we also assess current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in difficulties in their ability to make payments as they become due  additional allowances could be required  which would have a negative effect on our earnings and working capital 
inventory valuation inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on the first in  first out method 
we write down inventory for slow moving and obsolete inventory based on assessments of future demands  market conditions and customers who are expected to reduce purchasing requirements as a result of experiencing financial difficulties 
such assessments require the exercise of significant judgment by management 
if these factors were to become less favorable than those projected  additional inventory write downs could be required  which would have a negative effect on our earnings and working capital 
accounting for income taxes our income tax expense is dependent on the profitability of our various international subsidiaries including canada and sweden  and going forward  the united kingdom 
these subsidiaries are subject to income taxation based on local tax laws in these countries 
our us operations have continually incurred losses since inception 
our annual tax expense is based on our income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities 
significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions including evaluating uncertainties 
we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available 
if these factors were to become less favorable than those projected  or if there are changes in the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate  there could be an increase in tax expense and a resulting decrease in our earnings and working capital 
deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years 
such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources  including reversal of taxable temporary differences  forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies 
these sources of income inherently rely on estimates 
to provide insight  we use our historical experience and our short and long range business forecasts 
we believe it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred income tax assets may expire unused and have established a valuation allowance against them 
although realization is not assured for the remaining deferred income tax assets  primarily related to foreign tax jurisdictions  we believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be fully recoverable within the applicable statutory expiration periods 
however  deferred tax assets could be reduced in the near term if our estimates of taxable income in certain jurisdictions are significantly reduced or available tax planning strategies are no longer viable 
business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting  we record the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
we record the excess of purchase price over the aggregate fair values as goodwill 
we engage third party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
these valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions  particularly with respect to intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing purchased technology  customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect a marketplace participant would generate from the acquired assets 
if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to 
table of contents develop these values  we could experience impairment charges 
in addition  we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense 
if our estimates of the economic lives change  depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed 
goodwill we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually using a two step process  and more frequently upon the occurrence of certain triggering events 
during our annual impairment assessment  we early adopted the provisions of accounting standards update asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment  which gives an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
our october  impairment analysis included an assessment of certain qualitative factors including  but not limited to  the results of the prior year fair value calculation  the movement of our share price and market capitalization  the reporting unit and overall financial performance  and macroeconomic and industry conditions 
during the qualitative assessment of our fiscal annual goodwill impairment test  management concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of our engine control systems reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 
however  given the decrease in our share price and market capitalization since the prior year analysis  management decided to perform step of the goodwill impairment test as of october  our engine control systems reporting unit  which is within our heavy duty diesel systems reporting segment  has goodwill subject to impairment testing  which totalled million at december  and goodwill impairment testing requires us to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit 
the estimate of fair value is based on internally developed assumptions approximating those that a market participant would use in valuing the reporting unit 
we derived the estimated fair value of the engine control systems reporting unit at october  from a blending of market and income approach models 
we utilized a weighting of and between the market and income approaches  respectively 
significant assumptions used in deriving the fair value of the reporting unit under the income approach included annual revenue growth over the next five years ranging from to  long term revenue growth of and a discount rate of 
significant assumptions used in deriving the fair value of the reporting unit under the market approach included average multiples of times on revenue and times on ebitda 
we deemed that estimating cash flows discretely for five years was the most appropriate for our engine control systems reporting unit  as this division s business growth is driven by changes in the regulation of diesel emissions 
we anticipate the changing regulation of diesel emission in various countries over this period as well as the number of vehicles that will need to have updated emission systems installed 
we believe that we have a reasonable estimate of the opportunities over this period 
these new emission regulations are a driver of business growth for our engine control systems business 
in order to take into account the business implications of such regulations and the population of vehicles that must meet those regulations  we estimated revenues and cash flows to meet the demands of this marketplace for a five year time period 
the discount rate of was developed based on a weighted cost of capital wacc analysis 
within the wacc analysis  the cost of equity assumption was developed using the capital asset pricing model capm 
the inputs in both the capm and the cost of debt assumption utilized in the wacc were developed for our engine control systems business reporting unit using data from comparable companies 
the revenue growth rates used are higher than our historical growth patterns and consider future growth potential identified by management  however  there is no assurance such growth will be achieved 
in addition  we considered the overall fair value of our reporting units as compared to our market capitalization 
because the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by  we determined that no goodwill impairment existed as of december  however  it is reasonably possible that future results may differ from the estimates made during and future impairment tests may result in a different conclusion for the goodwill of our engine controls systems reporting unit 
in addition  the use of different estimates or assumptions by management could lead to different results 
our estimate of fair value of the reporting unit is sensitive to certain factors  including but not limited to the following movements in our share price  changes in discount rates and our cost of capital  growth of the reporting unit s revenue  cost structure of the reporting unit  successful completion of research and development  capital expenditures  customer acceptance of new products  competition  general economic conditions and approval of the reporting unit s product by regulatory agencies 
impairment of long lived assets other than goodwill we evaluate long lived assets  including intangible assets other than goodwill  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment is considered to exist if the total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the assets 
if an impairment does exist  we measure the impairment loss and record it based on discounted estimated future cash flows 
in estimating future cash flows  we group assets at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of cash flows from other asset groups 
considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value of the assets and  accordingly  actual results could vary significantly from such 
table of contents estimates 
our most significant estimates and judgments relating to the long lived asset impairments include the timing and amount of projected future cash flows 
these estimates and judgments are based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and growth rates and other factors  actual results of which may vary significantly 
in  we considered whether any events or changes in circumstance indicated that the carrying amount of our catalyst division s long lived assets may not be recoverable 
because of a disruption of sales  we conducted a recoverability test on the fixed assets of the catalyst division as of june  and concluded that the expected undiscounted cash flows associated with the assets substantially exceed their carrying value 
our analysis utilized two different scenarios over a five year period with a probability weighting 
one scenario assumed no additional program wins while the other scenario was based on a set of assumed program wins  resulting of revenue growth ranging from zero to over the next years 
each scenario also included a terminal value based upon an estimated value of intellectual property that could be sold off 
no events occurred during the second half of that significantly altered the assumptions made at june  and would necessitate further analysis 
in  we again considered whether any events or changes in circumstance indicated that the carrying amount of our catalyst division s long lived assets  totalling million at december   may not be recoverable 
we concluded that no triggering event occurred during that would lead us to believe that the assets were impaired 
therefore  no further testing was performed 
to the extent additional events or changes in circumstances occur  we may conclude that a non cash impairment charge against earnings is required  which could have an adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations 
fair value of embedded financial instruments the secured convertible notes issued to investors by csi prior to the merger contained two embedded financial instruments that require separate accounting at fair value the premium redemption feature and the contingent equity forward 
the estimate of fair value of such financial instruments involves the exercise of significant judgment and the use of estimates by management 
the premium redemption instrument represents the fair value of the additional penalty premium of two times x the outstanding principal amount plus the default interest that would have been due if the secured convertible notes were in default 
because the noteholders had the option of demanding payment or providing additional time extensions after august   this instrument was considered a put option 
we estimated the fair value of the premium redemption instrument by calculating the present value of million plus accrued interest  based on an assumed payment date eleven months after default date using a high yield discount rate of  multiplied by an estimated probability of its exercise 
because the secured convertible notes were converted into csi common stock immediately prior to the merger  the premium redemption instrument expired unexercised  resulting in gain of million in the year ended december  this amount represents the difference between the initial proceeds allocated to the instrument and its ultimate fair value of zero 
the contingent equity forward represents the additional million that the investors committed to fund immediately prior to closing of the merger 
because the funding would only have occurred from the same events that caused the secured convertible notes to automatically convert to csi equity prior to the merger  we considered it a commitment to purchase equity 
we estimated its fair value based on the intrinsic value of the forward  discounted at a risk free rate multiplied by the estimated probability that the forward will fund 
during the year ended december   we recognized a loss of million 
this reflects the difference between the intrinsic value on the settlement date of million and the initial proceeds allocated to the instrument of million 
stock based compensation expense we account for share based compensation using fair value recognition and record stock based compensation as a charge to earnings net of the estimated impact of forfeited awards 
as such  we recognize stock based compensation cost only for those stock based awards that are estimated to ultimately vest over their requisite service period  based on the vesting provisions of the individual grants 
the process of estimating the fair value of stock based compensation awards and recognizing stock based compensation cost over their requisite service period involves significant assumptions and judgments 
we estimate the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using a monte carlo univariate pricing model for awards with market conditions and the black scholes option valuation model for the remaining awards  which requires that we make certain assumptions regarding i the expected volatility in the market price of our common stock  ii dividend yield  iii risk free interest rates  and iv the period of time employees are expected to hold the award prior to exercise referred to as the expected holding period 
as a result  if we revise our assumptions and estimates  our stock based compensation expense could change materially for future grants 

table of contents warrant derivative liability in light of the terms of certain of our outstanding warrants  we have determined that we are required to carry them at fair value until exercised or expired  and record changes in their fair value recorded in our results of operations in each reporting period 
at december   we had a liability of million related to liability classified warrants 
for the year ended december   we recorded a non cash gain of million to other income in our statement of operations to reflect the change in fair value of these liability classified warrants 
the determination of fair value requires the use of judgment and estimates by management 
for common stock warrants with market conditions  we use the monte carlo pricing model to determine fair value on the grant date 
for other common stock warrants  we use the black scholes option valuation model  which requires that we make certain assumptions regarding i the expected volatility in the market price of our common stock  ii dividend yield  iii risk free interest rates  and iv the contractual terms of the warrants 
these variables are projected based on our historical data  experience  and other factors 
changes in any of these variables could result in material adjustments to the expense recognized for changes in the valuation of the warrant derivative liability 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no

recent developments common stock purchase agreement with lpc on october   we signed a purchase agreement with lpc  together with a registration rights agreement  whereby lpc has agreed to purchase up to million of our common stock over a month period 
pursuant to the registration rights agreement  we filed a registration statement on form s with the us securities and exchange commission sec on october  covering  shares that have been issued or may be issued to lpc under the purchase agreement 
of the shares registered   shares were issued to lpc as a commitment fee   shares may be issued to lpc pro rata as up to  of our stock is purchased by lpc as an additional commitment fee  and  represent shares that we may sell to lpc under the purchase agreement 
the registration statement related to the transaction was declared effective by the sec on december  accordingly  we have the right  in our sole discretion  over a month period to sell shares of our common stock to lpc in amounts of up to  to up to  per sale  depending on certain conditions as set forth in the purchase agreement  up to the aggregate amount of million 

table of contents there are no upper limits to the price lpc may pay to purchase our common stock and the purchase price of the shares related to the million of future funding will be based on the prevailing market prices of our shares preceding the time of sales as computed in accordance with the purchase agreement without any fixed discount  with us controlling the timing and amount of future sales  if any  of shares to lpc 
the purchase price per share is equal to the lesser of the lowest sales price of our common stock on the purchase date or the average of the three lowest closing sales prices of our common stock during the twelve consecutive business days prior to the date of the purchase by lpc 
lpc has agreed not to cause or engage in any manner whatsoever  any direct or indirect short selling or hedging of our shares of common stock 
in consideration for entering into the purchase agreement  we issued to lpc  shares of common stock as a commitment fee and are required to issue up to  shares of common stock pro rata as lpc purchases the million of our common stock over the month period 
we may terminate the purchase agreement at any time at our discretion without any cost or penalty 
the proceeds received by us under the purchase agreement are expected to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes

table of contents factors affecting future results factors affecting our heavy duty diesel systems division the nature of our business and  in particular  our heavy duty diesel systems division  is heavily influenced by government funding of emissions control projects and increased diesel emission control regulations 
compliance with these regulatory initiatives drives demand for our products and the timing of implementation of emission reduction projects 
for example  following the passage of the american recovery and reinvestment act of commonly referred to as the stimulus bill  government spending both federal and state increased 
as such  our heavy duty diesel systems divisions had increased revenues due to this additional funding in the president s initial us fiscal year budget proposed elimination of epa funding under the diesel emissions reduction act dera  however the final us budget reinstated funding of approximately million 
the president s us fiscal year budget proposal includes epa funding under dera for million 
however  funding for diesel retrofit programs in is expected to continue to accrue from funds allocated under the stimulus bill and other sources such as the funding under california s proposition b and from funding provided by the us department of transportation under its congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program 
in addition  government mandates around the world are being used increasingly to combat diesel emissions 
in particular  mandates such as the one in london and california described in the following paragraph  frequently require private vehicle fleet owners to pay for the emission retrofit devices to make their vehicles compliant with emission standards 
emission reduction programs are often one off  or have staggered compliance dates  which mean they do not generally result in a regular source of recurring revenues for our company 
for example  london  uk has mandated that certain heavy duty diesel vehicles entering the london low emissions zone or lez will be required to meet certain emission standards by january we believe that approximately  such vehicles were required to have a retrofit emission control device installed on the vehicle by year end in december  the regulator extended the deadline for compliance into the first quarter of we believe that a bulk of the vehicles were retrofit in the fourth quarter of calendar  with sales of our products of approximately million in the fourth quarter and million in the full year however  due to the extension  we expect additional sales in the first quarter of in the range of million to million 
in addition  we are exploring opportunities to participate in other such retrofit programs in europe  which may yield product sales in and beyond 
we may incur supplier accreditation  product verification  sales and marketing and inventory build up costs before we can realize revenues from such potential opportunities 
in addition  the california air resources board has mandated that all class and class heavy diesel trucks meet certain emission targets by  with interim targets established for  and such that of current operating diesel trucks will be required to meet these targets by we estimate that this rule will require well over  heavy duty diesel trucks to be replaced or retrofitted 
we estimate that approximately  to  vehicles will elect to retrofit and will form the target market for our products  providing us with an opportunity to sell our products and generate revenue in  and we will incur product verification and other expenditures relating to sales and marketing activities before we record orders and start shipping products 
while we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in gaining any particular level of sales from the various funding sources  emission programs and mandates  we expect to pursue these opportunities 
the timing of these sales is uncertain and could result in fluctuations in revenue from quarter to quarter during this year and beyond 
factors affecting our catalyst division because the customers of our catalyst division are oem auto makers  our business is also affected by macroeconomic factors that impact the automotive industry generally  which can result in increased or decreased purchases of vehicles  and consequently demand for our products 
the global economic crisis in the latter half of that continued through and had a negative effect on our customers in the automotive industry 
as such demand for our products  which our oem auto customers incorporate into the vehicles they sell  decreased 
in the future  if similar macroeconomic factors or other factors affect our customer base  our revenues will be similarly affected 
in addition  prior to  two oem auto customers accounted for a significant portion of our catalyst division revenues see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in the second half of  one of these auto makers accelerated manufacture of a vehicle that requires a catalyst product meeting a higher regulatory standard than the product currently supplied to such auto maker by our catalyst division 
based on current information from the customer  our products are now being tested for future emission standards  which may result in orders and product sales sometime in the future beyond if we were to win the business 
accordingly  we now expect negligible revenues from this customer in our catalyst division through and in january  we began shipment of catalyst to a new automobile manufacturer 
we expect to continue shipping catalyst to this new customer during demand from this customer has not yet been 
table of contents fully stabilized  as it represents a catalyst for a new model of automobile 
in addition  our largest oem auto customer reduced production in light of the earthquake and tsunami in japan in march and as a result  our catalyst sales in the second quarter of were unfavorably impacted 
this customer s operations returned to normal in august and our sales recovered accordingly in the third quarter 
we expect sales to this customer to continue at normal levels in supply of catalyst division products to heavy duty diesel systems division our strategy is to progressively utilize the products of our catalyst division in the products of our heavy duty diesel systems division 
we anticipate that our intercompany sales of catalysts will increase compared to historical levels  as our planned new products are approved by the regulatory agencies and begin to generate sales 
while this will not impact our reported sales  we believe that the manufacturing gross margin associated with these sales will improve the margins of our catalyst division and therefore improve our total gross margin 
results of operations comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  the merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition and as a result  our company s the legal acquirer consolidated financial statements are now those of csi the accounting acquirer  with the assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses of cdti being included in our financial statements effective from october   the date of the closing of the merger

gross profit for the year ended december  increased by million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  gross margin increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in gross profit was due to an increase in our heavy duty diesel systems division resulting from increased sales and increased margin in the catalyst division 
the decrease in gross margin for our heavy duty diesel systems division is a result of product mix and discounting in the london low emission zone and increases in platinum group metal prices in the first quarter of which were partially offset by price increases implemented during the second quarter and million in royalty sales by cdti s legacy business 
we anticipate that the gross margin in this business will continue to be adversely impacted by product mix and discounting in the london lez in the first quarter of  thereafter improving as a result of improved product mix and higher volumes of sales as a result of the california truck and bus rules that are anticipated in the second half of the year see factors affecting future results above 
the increase in gross margin for our catalyst division is a result of increased intercompany sales  sales to our new automaker customer at favorable margins and improved operating efficiencies  which were partially offset by reduced sales to our other automaker customers 
gross margins in this division are calculated on the total revenue of the division  including inter company sales 
inter company sales are eliminated in consolidation along with the cost of goods associated with these sales resulting in the full benefit of the gross profit on these sales to the business 
as a result of anticipated shift in mix to products with higher pass through content at zero margin  we expect to see lower margins in this division in the first half of with margins comparable to in the second half of due to favorable product mix and volume see factors affecting future results above

liquidity and capital resources historically  the revenue that we generated has not been sufficient to fund our operating requirements and debt servicing needs 
notably  we have suffered recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception 
our primary sources of liquidity in recent years have been asset sales  credit facilities and other borrowings and equity sales 
at december   we had million available under our fgi credit facility  subject to the availability of eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances for collateral 
we can also sell up to million in common stock to lpc under our purchase agreement with lpc 
assuming a purchase price of per share the closing sale price of our common stock on march  and the purchase by lpc of the full  currently registered purchase shares  proceeds to us would be million 
due to improved financial performance and actions taken to improve our liquidity  including the availability with fgi and lpc  as discussed below  management believes that we will have access to sufficient working capital to sustain operations through at least the next twelve months 
however  no assurances can be provided that we will have sufficient cash and credit to sustain operations or that we will  if necessary  be able to raise additional capital or reduce discretionary spending to provide the required liquidity 
our stock price has been extremely volatile and there is no guarantee we will be able to obtain the funding from lpc at the level mentioned above 
for example  our stock price at december  was which would have limited our funding capacity from lpc to million 
although the merger which was completed on october  was initially anticipated to provide sufficient cash to the combined company  unforeseen delays in completing the merger led to significantly higher transactional costs for both cdti and csi 
in addition  the reduction in catalyst sales discussed above under factors affecting future results resulted in lower cash inflows than previously anticipated 
thus  our post merger company had less cash than we needed to incur the sales  marketing and product verification expenditures required to be made in advance of realizing the anticipated sales in the london lez as well as the expenditures needed to complete verification of certain products of our catalyst division for use in the products of our heavy duty diesel systems division 
we continued to work on improving our liquidity position and in february we entered into the fgi financing facility and repaid fifth third bank  and in may we issued million of our subordinated convertible notes to a shareholder 
additionally  on june   we entered into an underwriting agreement with roth capital partners  llc  and on july   we closed a public offering in which we sold  shares and the selling stockholders sold  shares of our common stock see recent development public offering of common stock above 
we received million in net proceeds from the offering after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses 
we continue to pursue revenue generating opportunities relating to special government mandated retrofit programs in california and potentially others in various jurisdictions domestically and internationally 
opportunities such as these require cash investment in operating expenses and working capital such as inventory and receivables 
table of contents prior to realizing profits and cash from sales 
to address the potential need for capital  on october   we signed a purchase agreement with lpc  together with a registration rights agreement  whereby lpc has agreed to purchase up to million of our common stock over a month period 
the registration statement for  shares related to the transaction was declared effective by the sec on december  of the shares registered   shares were issued to lpc as a commitment fee   shares may be issued to lpc pro rata as up to  of our stock is purchased by lpc as an additional commitment fee  and  represent shares that we may sell to lpc under the purchase agreement 
accordingly  we have the right  in our sole discretion  over a month period to sell shares of our common stock to lpc in amounts of up to  to up to  per sale  depending on certain conditions as set forth in the purchase agreement  up to the aggregate amount of million see recent developments common stock purchase agreement with lpc above
