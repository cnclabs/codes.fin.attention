business combinations covergence inc on april   we acquired covergence inc  or covergence  a then emerging  innovative provider of software based session border controllers for delivering voip ip telephony  unified communications and service orientated architecture applications within global enterprises 
the aggregate purchase price was million  consisting of  shares of our common stock  valued at approximately million   in cash payments to the stockholders of covergence and the payment of withholding taxes due for the former chief executive officer of covergence  of approximately  we also incurred approximately  of fees associated with the registration of the common stock issued  which has been recorded as a reduction to the purchase price 
the transaction was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting 
accordingly  the results of operations of covergence have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition 
all of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction have been recognized at their acquisition date fair values which were finalized at december  the acquisition of covergence was deemed a bargain purchase for accounting purposes and a gain of million was recorded in other income in our consolidated statement of income in we also incurred million of merger and integration related costs associated with our acquisition of covergence which we recorded as an expense in our consolidated statement of income during newfound communications  inc on january   we acquired newfound communications  inc  or newfound communications  an emerging  innovative provider of call recording solutions for the ip communications industry 
the aggregate purchase price was million in cash payments to the stockholders of newfound communications 
in allocating the total preliminary purchase price for newfound communications based on estimated fair values  we recorded million of goodwill  million of identifiable intangible assets and  of net tangible liabilities 
in connection with the acquisition of newfound communications  we incurred  of merger and integration related costs during  which we recorded as an expense in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended december  
table of contents this transaction was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting 
accordingly  pro forma information reflecting the acquisition of newfound communications has not been provided because the impact on revenues  net income and net income per common share attributable to our shareholders is not material 
all of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction have been recognized at their acquisition date fair values  which was finalized at december  industry background service providers traditionally have delivered voice and data services over two separate networks the public switched telephone network  or pstn  and the internet 
the pstn provides high reliability and security but is costly to operate and is limited in its ability to support high bandwidth video and other interactive multimedia services 
the internet is capable of cost effectively transmitting any form of traffic that is ip based  including interactive voice  video and data  but it transmits traffic only on a best efforts basis  because all forms of traffic have the same priority 
therefore  the internet attempts to deliver all traffic without distinction  which can result in significantly varying degrees of service quality for the same or similar types of traffic transmissions 
internet based services are also subject to disruptive and fraudulent behavior including identity theft  viruses  unwanted and excessively large input data  known as spam  and the unauthorized use and attempts to circumvent or bypass security mechanisms associated with those services  known as hacking 
service providers are migrating to a single ip network architecture to serve as the foundation for their next generation voice  video  multimedia and data service offerings 
recently  an increasing number of enterprises  including contact centers and government agencies have begun to migrate to a single ip network architecture as well 
in order to provide secure and high quality interactive communications on a converged ip network  service providers and enterprises must be able to control the communications flows that comprise communication sessions 
key financial highlights some of our key financial highlights for include the following total revenue was million compared to million in net income was million compared to million in earnings per share was per share on a diluted basis in both and cash provided by operating activities was million compared to million in cash provided by financing activities was million compared to million in the acme packet strategy principal elements of our strategy include continuing to satisfy the evolving border requirements of enterprises and fixed line  mobile and over the top service providers 
our product deployments position us to gain valuable knowledge that we can use to expand and enhance our products features and functionality 
we may develop new products organically  or through selective acquisitions 
implementing new technologies to enhance product performance and scalability 
we will seek to leverage new technologies as they become available to increase the performance  capacity and functionality of our product family  as well as to reduce our costs 
investing in quality and responsive support 
as we broaden our product platform and increase our product capabilities  we will continue to provide comprehensive service and support targeted at maximizing customer satisfaction and retention 

table of contents facilitating and promoting service interconnects and federations among our customers 
we intend to drive increased demand for our products by helping our customers to extend the reach of their services and applications and  consequently  to increase the value of their services to their customers 
leveraging distribution partnerships to enhance market penetration 
we will continue to invest in training and tools for our distribution partners sales  systems engineering and support organizations  in order to improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of these partnerships 
actively contributing to architecture and standards definition processes 
we will utilize our breadth and depth of experience with sbc deployments to contribute significantly to organizations developing standards and architectures for next generation ip networks 
factors that may affect future performance global macroeconomic conditions 
we believe that the capital budgets and spending initiatives of some of our core customers service providers  enterprises  government agencies and contact centers may be affected by current worldwide economic conditions 
our ability to generate revenue from these core customers is dependent on the status of such budgets and initiatives 
gross margin 
our gross margin has been  and will continue to be  affected by many factors  including a the demand for our products and services  b the average selling price of our products  which in turn depends  in part  on the mix of product and product configurations sold  c the level of software license upgrades  d the cost of acquiring our products for sale  e new product introductions  f the mix of sales channels through which our products are sold  and g the costs of manufacturing our hardware products and providing our related support services 
customers license our software in various configurations depending on each customer s requirements for session capacity  feature groups and protocols 
the product software configuration mix will have a direct impact on the average selling price of the system sold 
systems with higher software content higher session capacity  support for higher number of security protocols and a larger number of feature groups will generally have a higher average selling price than those systems sold with lower software content 
if customers begin to purchase systems with lower software content  this may have a negative impact on our revenue and gross margins 
competition 
competition in our product categories is strong and constantly evolving 
while we believe we are currently the market leader in the service provider and enterprise markets for session delivery network solutions  we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future as the market grows 
our competitors vary by market segment and product category 
in the service provider market overall  our primary competitors include genband inc  telefonaktiebolaget lm ericsson  huawei technologies co  ltd  metaswitch networks ltd 
and sonus networks inc we believe we compete successfully with all of these companies based upon our experience in interactive communications networks  the breadth of our applications and standards support  the depth of our border control features  the demonstrated ability of our products to interoperate with key communications infrastructure elements and our comprehensive service and support 
we also believe our products are priced competitively with our competitors offerings 
as the session delivery network solutions market opportunity grows  we expect competition from additional networking and ip communications equipment suppliers  including distribution partners 
evolution of the session delivery network solutions market 
the market for our products is still evolving  and it is uncertain whether these products will continue to achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance 
our success will depend  to a substantial extent  on the willingness of interactive communications service providers and enterprises to continue to implement our solutions 
demand is also dependent upon the respective geographic regions where our customers are located 
for example  in  we experienced a level of demand that was lower than we had expected from our service provider customers in north america  which had an adverse effect on our operations 

table of contents research and development 
to continue to achieve market acceptance for our products  we must effectively anticipate and adapt  in a timely manner  to customer requirements and must offer products that meet changing customer demands 
prospective customers may require product features and capabilities that our current products do not have 
the market for session delivery network solutions is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  and evolving industry requirements 
we intend to continue to invest in our research and development efforts  which we believe are essential to maintaining our competitive position 
managing growth 
we significantly expanded our operations in and during the period from january  through december  we increased the number of our employees and full time independent contractors by  from to we anticipate that further expansion of our infrastructure and headcount will be required to achieve planned expansion of our product offerings  projected increases in our customer base and anticipated growth in the number of product deployments 
in the future  we expect to continue to carefully manage the increase of our operating expenses based on our ability to expand our revenues  the expansion of which could occur organically or through future acquisitions 
revenue we derive product revenue from the sale of our net net hardware and the licensing of our net net software 
we generally recognize product revenue at the time of product delivery  provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
for arrangements that include customer acceptance or other material non standard terms  we recognize revenue after acceptance or when the non standard terms are resolved  assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
we generate maintenance  support and service revenue from a maintenance associated with software licenses  b technical support services for our software product  c hardware repair and maintenance services  d implementation  training and consulting services and e reimbursable travel and other out of pocket expenses 
we offer our products and services indirectly through distribution partners and directly through our sales force 
our distribution partners include networking and telecommunications equipment vendors throughout the world 
our distribution partners generally purchase our products after they have received a purchase order from their customers and  generally  do not maintain an inventory of our products in anticipation of sales to their customers 
generally  the pricing offered to our distribution partners will be lower than to our direct customers 
the product configuration  which reflects the mix of session capacity  signaling protocol support and requested features  determines the price for each product sold and licensed 
customers can purchase our products in either a standalone or high availability configuration and can license our software in various configurations  depending on the customers requirements for session capacity  functionality and protocols 
the product software configuration mix will have a direct impact on the average selling price of the system sold 
as the market continues to develop and grow  we expect to experience increased price pressure on our products and services 
we believe that our revenue and results of operations may vary significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of long sales and deployment cycles  variations in customer ordering patterns  and the application of complex revenue recognition rules to certain transactions 
some of our arrangements with customers include clauses under which we may be subject to penalties for failure to meet specified performance obligations 
we have not incurred any such penalties to date 
cost of revenue cost of product revenue consists primarily of a third party manufacturers fees for purchased materials and services  combined with our expenses for b salaries  wages and related benefits for our manufacturing personnel  c related overhead  d provision for inventory obsolescence  e amortization of intangible assets 
table of contents and f stock based compensation 
amortization of intangible assets represents the amortization of developed technologies from our acquisitions of covergence and newfound communications 
cost of maintenance  support and service revenue consists primarily of a salaries  wages and related benefits for our support and service personnel  b related overhead  c billable and non billable travel  lodging  and other out of pocket expenses  d material costs consumed in the provision of services and e stock based compensation 
gross profit our gross profit has been  and will be  affected by many factors  including a the demand for our products and services  b the average selling price of our products  which in turn depends  in part  on the mix of product and product configurations sold or licensed  c the mix between product and service revenue  d the cost of acquiring our products  e new product introductions  f the mix of sales channels through which our products are sold  g the volume and costs of manufacturing our hardware products  h the costs associated with fulfilling our maintenance and warranty obligations  and i personnel and related costs for manufacturing  support and services 
operating expenses operating expenses consist of sales and marketing  research and development  general and administrative  and merger and integration related expenses 
personnel related costs are the most significant component of each of these expense categories 
during the period from january  through december   we increased the number of our employees and full time independent contractors by  from to we expect to continue to hire new employees to support our anticipated growth 
sales and marketing expense consists primarily of a salaries and related personnel costs  b commissions and bonuses  c travel  lodging and other out of pocket expenses  d marketing programs such as trade shows  e stock based compensation and f other related overhead 
commissions are recorded as expense when earned by the employee 
we anticipate that sales and marketing expense will remain relatively consistent as a percentage of revenue in the future 
research and development expense consists primarily of a salaries and related personnel costs  b payments to suppliers for design and consulting services  c prototype and equipment costs relating to the design and development of new products and enhancement of existing products  d quality assurance and testing  e stock based compensation and f other related overhead 
to date  all of the costs related to our research and development efforts have been expensed as incurred as technological feasibility is determined at the same time as release 
we intend to continue to invest in our research and development efforts  which we believe are essential to maintaining our competitive position 
we expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars 
however  we anticipate that research and development expense will modestly increase as a percentage of total revenue in the future 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of a salaries  wages and personnel costs related to our executive  finance  human resource and information technology organizations  b accounting and legal professional fees  c expenses associated with uncollectible accounts  d stock based compensation and e other related overhead 
we expect general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars as we invest in infrastructure to support continued growth and incur ongoing expenses related to being a publicly traded company 
however  we anticipate that general and administrative expense will remain relatively consistent as a percentage of total revenue in the future 
merger and integration related expenses consists primarily of transaction expenses and severance related charges 

table of contents stock based compensation cost of revenue and operating expenses include stock based compensation expense 
we expense share based payment awards with compensation cost for share based payment transactions measured at fair value 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded expense of million  million and million  respectively  in connection with share based payment awards 
based on share based awards granted from through  a future expense of non vested options of million is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
in july  our board of directors approved an offer  or the offer  to our employees  excluding members of our board of directors and our section officers  to exchange option grants that had i an exercise price greater than or equal to the higher of a or b a price at least higher than the closing price of our common stock on the expiration date of the offer  ii were granted under the acme packet  inc equity incentive plan  and iii were held by eligible option holders 
eligible participants were all persons who were employees including employees on an expatriate assignment hired on  or before july  and who remained employees through the date on which the new options were granted  and included certain independent contractors who continued to provide services to us through the date on which the new options were granted 
the offer expired on august   and upon the expiration  we exchanged the tendered options that had exercise prices equal to or greater than per share for new options 
the tendered options that were exchanged for new options were cancelled on the expiration date of the offer 
as a result  an aggregate of  options  with exercise prices ranging from to per share  were cancelled and exchanged for  options with an exercise price per share of 
the new options began to vest on the new option grant date  whereby of the new options vest on the first anniversary of the new option grant date  and the remainder vesting ratably on a quarterly basis over the final three years of the vesting period 
on the date of the exchange  the estimated fair value of the new options did not exceed the estimated fair value of the exchanged stock options calculated immediately prior to the exchange 
as such  there was no incremental stock based compensation expense associated with the new options  and we did not record additional compensation expense related to the exchange 
we will continue to recognize the remaining compensation expense related to the exchanged options over the vesting period of the new options 
other expense income  net other expense income consists primarily of gains or losses from foreign currency translation adjustments of our international activities 
the functional currency of our international operations in europe and asia is the us dollar 
accordingly  all assets and liabilities of these international subsidiaries are re measured into us dollars using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date  or historical rate  as appropriate 
revenue and expenses of these international subsidiaries are re measured into us dollars at the average rates in effect during the period 
any differences resulting from the re measurement of assets  liabilities and operations of the european and asian subsidiaries are recorded within other expense income 
other expense income also includes interest income earned on cash  cash equivalents and investments 
we have invested cash in high quality securities and are not materially affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
application of critical accounting policies and use of estimates our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
our actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
there have been no material changes to these estimates for the periods presented in this annual report on form k 

table of contents we believe that some of our significant accounting policies  which are more fully described in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the consideration is fixed or determinable and collection of the related accounts receivable is deemed probable 
in making these judgments  management evaluates these criteria as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
we consider a non cancellable agreement signed by the customer and us to be representative of persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
delivery has occurred 
we consider delivery to have occurred when product has been delivered to the customer and no significant post delivery obligations exist 
in instances where customer acceptance is required  delivery is deemed to have occurred when customer acceptance has been achieved 
certain of our agreements contain products that might not conform to published specifications or contain a requirement to deliver additional elements which are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements 
revenue associated with these agreements is recognized when the customer specifications have been met or delivery of the additional elements has occurred 
consideration is fixed or determinable 
we consider the consideration to be fixed or determinable unless the consideration is subject to refund or adjustment  or is not payable within normal payment terms 
if the consideration is subject to refund or adjustment  we recognize revenue when the right to a refund or adjustment lapses 
if offered payment terms exceed our normal terms  then revenue is recognized upon the receipt of cash 
collection is deemed probable 
we conduct a credit review for all transactions at the inception of an arrangement and then routinely on an ongoing basis to determine the creditworthiness of the customer 
collection is deemed probable if  based upon our evaluation  we expect that the customer will be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as payments become due 
if we determine that collection is not probable  revenue is deferred and recognized upon the receipt of cash 
our revenue arrangements regularly include the sale of hardware  licensing of software  and provision of maintenance  support and services 
revenue arrangements may include one of these single elements  or may incorporate one or more elements in a single transaction or some combination of related transactions 
on january   we prospectively adopted the guidance of accounting standards update asu no 
 revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu no 
and asu no 
 software topic certain revenue arrangements that include software elements asu no 
 which were ratified by the financial accounting standards board fasb emerging issues task force on september  asu no 
affects accounting and reporting for all multiple deliverable arrangements 
it also applies to companies that are affected by the amendments of asu no 
the amendments in asu no 
provide that tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the tangible product s essential functionality are no longer within the scope of the software revenue guidance in accounting standards codification asc topic  software revenue recognition asc and should follow the guidance in asu no 
for multiple element arrangements 
all non essential and standalone software components will continue to be accounted for under the guidance of asc asu no 
establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable in a revenue arrangement 
the selling price for each deliverable is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  if available  third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available  or our best estimated selling price 
table of contents besp if neither vsoe nor tpe are available 
the amendments in asu no 
eliminate the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration and require that it be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
the relative selling price method allocates any discount in the arrangement proportionately to each deliverable on the basis of the deliverable s estimated selling price 
for all transactions entered into prior to january  and for those transactions which include the licensing of stand alone or non essential software as an element after january   we allocate revenue among the multiple elements associated with the stand alone and non essential software based on the software revenue recognition guidance 
because we generally do not sell any of our products on a standalone basis  we have yet to establish vsoe for these offerings 
accordingly  when arrangements include multiple elements  we allocate the total fee among the various elements using the residual method 
under the residual method  revenue is recognized when vsoe of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements of the arrangement  but does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements of the arrangement 
each arrangement requires us to analyze the individual elements in the transaction and to estimate the fair value of each undelivered element  which typically represents maintenance and services 
revenue is allocated to each of the undelivered elements based on its respective fair value  with the fair value determined by the price charged when that element is sold or licensed separately 
if vsoe of fair value for any undelivered element does not exist  revenue from the entire arrangement is deferred and recognized at the earlier of a delivery of those elements for which vsoe of fair value does not exist or b when vsoe is established 
however  in instances where maintenance services are the only undelivered element without vsoe of fair value  the entire arrangement is recognized ratably as a single unit of accounting over the contractual service period 
for transactions entered into subsequent to the adoption of asu no 
that include multiple elements  arrangement consideration is allocated to each element based on the relative selling prices of all of the elements in the arrangement using the fair value hierarchy as required by asu no 
we limit the amount of revenue recognition for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services  future performance obligation  or subject to customer specific return or refund privileges 
consistent with the methodology used under the previous accounting guidance  we establish vsoe for our training services  post sale customer support and installation services based on the sales price charged for each element when it is sold 
because we generally do not sell any of our hardware or software products on a standalone basis  we have yet to establish vsoe for these offerings 
we typically are not able to determine tpe for our products or certain of our services 
tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar elements when sold or licensed separately 
generally  our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be determined 
furthermore  we are unable to reliably determine the selling prices on a stand alone basis of similar products offered by our competitors 
when we are unable to establish the selling price of our products or certain services using vsoe or tpe  we use besp in our allocation of arrangement consideration 
the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold or licensed on a stand alone basis 
we determine besp for a product or service by considering multiple factors including  but not limited to  pricing practices  geographies  customer classes and distribution channels 
we plan to analyze the selling prices used in our allocation of arrangement consideration  at a minimum  on an annual basis 
selling prices will be analyzed on a more frequent basis if a significant change in our business necessitates a more frequent analysis  or if we experience significant variances in our selling prices 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we offset gross trade accounts receivable with an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts on a regular basis  and all past due balances are reviewed individually for collectability 
account balances are charged against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded in general and administrative expense 
if our historical collection experience does not reflect our future ability to collect outstanding accounts receivables  our future provision for doubtful accounts could be materially affected 
to date  we have not incurred any significant write offs of accounts receivable and have not been required to revise any of our assumptions or estimates used in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts 
as of december   the allowance for doubtful accounts was million 
stock based compensation for stock options issued under our stock based compensation plans  the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model  and an estimated forfeiture rate is used when calculating stock based compensation expense for the period 
for restricted stock units issued under our stock based compensation plans  the fair value of each grant is calculated based on our stock price on the date of grant and an estimated forfeiture rate is used when calculating stock based compensation expense for the period 
we recognize the compensation cost of stock based awards on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the award 
the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized stock based compensation are reported as a financing activity rather than an operating activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
this requirement reduces net operating cash flows and increases net financing cash flows in certain periods 
prior to the second quarter of  as the trading history of our common stock was limited  we determined the volatility for options granted in based on an analysis of reported data for a peer group of companies that issued options with substantially similar terms 
the expected volatility of options granted between january  through june  was determined using a weighted average of the historical volatility measures of this peer group of companies as well as the historical volatility of our common stock 
the expected life of options was determined using the simplified method as prescribed by the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment 
commencing in the third quarter of  we began to estimate volatility based on the historical prices of our common stock  and the expected term based upon the historical exercise behavior of our employees 
the risk free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the award is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
we have not paid and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock  therefore  the expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero 
in addition  as discussed above  we utilize an estimated forfeiture rate when calculating the expense for the period 
we have applied estimated forfeiture rates derived from an analysis of historical data of  and for the years ended december   and  respectively  in determining the expense recorded in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
we recorded stock based compensation expense of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as of december   there was million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock option awards that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
inventory we recognize inventory losses based on obsolescence and levels in excess of forecasted demand 
in these cases  inventory is written down to its estimated realizable value based on historical usage and expected demand 
inherent in our estimates of market value in determining inventory valuation are estimates related to economic 
table of contents trends  future demand for our products and technical obsolescence of our products 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs could be required and would be reflected in the cost of product revenue in the period the revision is made 
to date  we have not been required to revise any of our assumptions or estimates used in determining our inventory valuations 
when products have been delivered  but the product revenue associated with the arrangement has been deferred as a result of not meeting the revenue recognition criteria  we also defer the related inventory costs for the delivered items and classify these items as deferred product costs 
research and development expense for software products research and development expense includes costs incurred to develop intellectual property 
the costs for the development of new software and substantial enhancements to existing software are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established  at which time any additional costs would be capitalized 
we have determined that technological feasibility is established at the time a working model of software is completed 
because we believe our current process for developing software will be essentially completed concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility  no costs have been capitalized to date 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in both the us and international jurisdictions  and we use estimates in determining our provision for income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method for accounting and reporting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using statutory rates 
this process requires us to project our current tax liability and estimate our deferred tax assets and liabilities  including net operating losses  or nol  and tax credit carryforwards 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we considered our recent operating results  future taxable income projections and feasible tax planning strategies 
due to the evolving nature and complexity of tax rules combined with the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate  it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability could change in the future  which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
as of december  and  we had no material unrecognized tax benefits 
business combinations we record tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations under the purchase method of accounting 
amounts paid for each acquisition are allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition 
we then allocate the purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired to identifiable intangible assets based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management 
we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed to goodwill 
if the fair value of the assets acquired exceeds our purchase price  the excess is recognized as a gain 
significant management judgments and assumptions are required in determining the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities  particularly acquired intangible assets 
the valuation of purchased intangible assets is based upon estimates of the future performance and cash flows from the acquired business 
each asset is measured at fair value from the perspective of a market participant 
for instance  in connection with the covergence acquisition  we have used the excess earnings method to value the acquired intangible assets related to developed technology  customer relationships and in process research and development 
this method is an income approach that identifies the future cash flows specifically related to the individual assets 
the trademarks and patents were valued via a relief from royalty method 
this method identifies similar licensing transactions for trademarks and patents and then applies those rates to the acquired assets 

table of contents if different assumptions are used  it could materially impact the purchase price allocation and adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
impairment of intangible assets and goodwill we amortize our intangible assets that have finite lives using either the straight line method or  if reliably determinable  based on the pattern in which the economic benefit of the asset is expected to be consumed utilizing expected undiscounted future cash flows 
amortization is recorded over the estimated useful lives ranging from three to sixteen years 
in process research and development is carried at its initial fair value and is amortized to expense upon completion of development 
we review our intangible assets subject to amortization to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life 
if the carrying value of an asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows  we will write down the carrying value of the intangible asset to its fair value in the period identified 
in assessing recoverability  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and discount rates 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges 
we generally calculate fair value as the present value of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset using a risk adjusted discount rate 
if the estimate of an intangible asset s remaining useful life is changed  we will amortize the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset prospectively over the revised remaining useful life 
for goodwill  we review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may exceed its fair value 
conditions that could trigger a more frequent impairment assessment include  but are not limited to  a significant adverse change in certain agreements  significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  an economic downturn in customers industries  increased competition  a significant reduction in our stock price for a sustained period or a reduction of our market capitalization relative to net book value 
we evaluate impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
the estimates we make in determining the fair value of our reporting unit involve the application of judgment  which could affect the timing and size of any future impairment charges 
for the year ended december   we elected to adopt asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment 
under asu  we have the option to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary

this increase was partially offset by a decrease in the average selling price of our systems due to changes in our product software configuration mix  including software upgrades  the mix of system platforms purchased by our customers and the sales channels through which they are sold

the product software configuration mix has a direct impact on the average selling price of a system sold 
systems with higher software content driven by higher session capacity support  higher number of signaling protocols or a higher number of feature groups will generally have a higher average selling price than those systems sold with lower software content 
the growth in product revenue was primarily due to the growth of our indirect sales channel  partially offset by a decrease in our direct sales channel 
indirect product revenues increased million  primarily due to a million increase attributable to our customers in the us and canada as well as an increase of million related to our international customers

these increases were partially offset by decreases of million in other cost of sales and  in manufacturing supplies 
the million increase in cost of maintenance  support and service revenue was primarily due to a a million increase in salaries and related benefits corresponding to a increase in employee headcount for our services organization to support our rapidly growing customer base  b a  increase in stock based compensation expense  c a  increase in facilities costs and related overhead  and d a  increase in travel and entertainment expenses reflecting the aforementioned increase in related headcount 
these increases were partially offset by a  decrease in costs associated with performance of our maintenance and warranty obligations 
product gross margin remained consistent 
the increase in product revenue corresponded with an increase in related costs 
as previously stated  the increase in product revenue was related to an increase in systems revenues partially offset by a decrease in the average selling price of our systems due to changes in our product software configuration mix  including software upgrades  the mix of system platforms purchased by our customers and the sales channels through which they are sold 
gross margin on maintenance  support and service revenue increased by three percent  primarily due to an increase in maintenance revenues associated with the growth in our installed product base  and the timing of maintenance renewal orders received in  without a corresponding increase in related costs 
we expect cost of product  maintenance  support and service revenue each to increase at approximately the same rate as the related revenue for the foreseeable future 
as a result  we expect that gross profit will increase  but that the related gross margin will remain relatively consistent with historical rates for the foreseeable future

we expect sales and marketing expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue for the foreseeable future as we expand our sales force to continue to increase our revenue and market share

these increases were partially offset by a  decrease in bad debt expense  and a  decrease in office and computer supplies 
the balance was due to increased facility and overhead costs 
we expect general and administrative expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we invest in infrastructure to support continued growth and incur expenses related to being a publicly traded company

the increase in interest income was primarily due to an increase in the average cash balance  and to a lesser extent  higher average interest rates in the year ended december  as a result of the final purchase price allocation related to our acquisition of covergence in  we determined that the fair value of the net assets acquired  primarily the acquired identifiable intangible assets and the deferred tax assets  exceeded the fair value of the consideration transferred 
consequently  we reassessed the recognition and measurement of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed and concluded that all acquired assets and assumed liabilities were properly recognized and the valuation procedures and resulting measures were appropriate 
as a result  we recognized a gain of million in other expense primarily consisted of foreign currency translation adjustments of our international subsidiaries and sales consummated in foreign currencies 
the increase in expense from to was primarily due to fluctuations in the value of the euro and british pound 
provision for income taxes year ended december  period to period change amount percentage of total revenue amount percentage of total revenue amount percentage provision for income taxes our effective tax rate was in as compared to in the lower effective tax rate in was primarily due to a book gain recognized on the acquisition of covergence for which there is no associated tax expense and the disallowance of the federal domestic manufacturing credit in as the result of being in a taxable net loss position due to the effects of excess tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options and the vesting of restricted stock units 
liquidity and capital resources resources since  we have funded our operations primarily with the growth in our operating cash flows  and more recently  we have supplemented our cash flows from the exercise of stock options 
in october  we completed an ipo and raised million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions 
to date we have not used nor designated any of the proceeds from our ipo 

table of contents key measures of our liquidity are as follows as of and for the year ended december  in thousands cash and cash equivalents short and long term investments accounts receivable  net working capital cash provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities cash provided by financing activities cash  cash equivalents  short and long term investments 
our cash and cash equivalents at december  were invested primarily in high quality securities and are not materially affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
our short and long term investments consist of high quality government treasuries and bonds 
the cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
restricted cash  which totaled   and million at december   and  respectively  is not included in cash and cash equivalents  and was held in certificates of deposit as collateral for letters of credit related to the lease agreement for our sales office in madrid  spain in  and  our current corporate headquarters in bedford  massachusetts in  and our former corporate headquarters in burlington  massachusetts in accounts receivable  net 
our accounts receivable balance fluctuates from period to period  which affects our cash flow from operating activities 
the fluctuations vary depending on the timing of our shipments and related invoicing activity  cash collections  and changes in our allowance for doubtful accounts 
in some situations we receive a cash payment from a customer prior to the time we are able to recognize revenue on a transaction 
we record these payments as deferred revenue  which has a positive effect on our accounts receivable balances 
we use days sales outstanding  or dso  calculated on a quarterly basis  as a measurement of the quality and status of our receivables 
we define dso as a accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  divided by b total revenue for the most recent quarter  multiplied by c days 
dso was days at december  and days at december  the increase in dso at december  was primarily due to the timing of shipments and the related revenue recognition and aging of receivables during the three months ended december  more specifically  the product revenue that we recognized in the three months ended december  was related to customer orders which had been shipped  either in a prior fiscal quarter  or earlier in the fourth quarter of  where we had also collected the outstanding accounts receivable 
we did not experience a similar trend in the three months ended december   nor do we expect that this trend will re occur in the short term 
operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities primarily consists of net income adjusted for certain non cash items including depreciation and amortization  impairment of intangible assets  deferred income taxes  provision for bad debts  stock based compensation  offset by the associated excess tax benefit  and the effect of changes in working capital and other activities 
cash provided by operating activities in was million and consisted of a million of net income  b non cash deductions of million consisting primarily of million of stock based compensation  million of depreciation and amortization  million in provisions for excess and obsolete inventory   in amortization of premium discount on investments and  in provisions for bad debts all of which were partially offset by a deduction of million related to the tax savings from the exercise  by employees  of stock options and a million decrease in deferred income taxes and c million provided by working capital and other activities 
cash provided by working capital and other activities primarily reflected a million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities  million decrease in other assets and a million increase in accounts payable partially offset by an increase of million in accounts receivable  a million decrease in deferred revenues  a million increase in inventory and a million decrease in deferred product costs 
the increase 
table of contents in inventory primarily reflects the continuing actions of our manufacturing organization to mitigate the risk of supply chain disruption 
investing activities 
cash used in investing activities in was million  which included million in purchases of marketable securities  million in purchases of property and equipment  and million in cash paid for the acquisition of newfound communications  all partially offset by million from the maturities and sales of marketable securities and  from the refund of the security deposits on the lease of our corporate headquarters as part of the signed lease amendment as well as our previous location in madrid  spain 
financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities in included million of excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options  proceeds from the exercise of common stock options in the amount of million and million in proceeds from the employee stock purchase plan partially offset by  in payment of withholding taxes on rsu vesting 
anticipated cash flows 
we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents and short and long term investments and our cash flow from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
our future working capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of our revenue growth  our introduction of new products and enhancements  and our expansion of sales and marketing and product development activities 
to the extent that our cash  cash equivalents  short and long term investments and cash flow from operating activities are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through bank credit arrangements or public or private equity or debt financings 
we also may need to raise additional funds in the event we determine in the future to effect one or more acquisitions of businesses  technologies and products that will complement our existing operations 
in the event additional funding is required  and given the current condition of the global financial markets  we may not be able to obtain bank credit arrangements or affect an equity or debt financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 
income taxes 
during the year ended december   we recognized excess tax benefits associated with the exercise and sale of incentive stock options and the exercise of non qualified stock options of million 
these excess tax benefits resulted in a net operating loss  for tax purposes  which allowed us to partially offset taxable income in  and fully offset taxable income in under the carryback provisions of the internal revenue code of as a result  we have recorded an income tax receivable of million as of december  we currently expect to realize recorded net deferred tax assets as of december  of million 
our conclusion that these assets will be recovered is based upon the expectation that our current and future earnings will provide sufficient taxable income to realize the recorded tax assets 
the realization of our net deferred tax assets cannot be assured  and to the extent that future taxable income against which these tax assets may be applied is not sufficient  some or all of our recorded net deferred tax asset would not be realizable 
approximately million of the deferred tax assets recorded as of december  is attributable to benefits associated with stock based compensation charges 
in accordance with the provision of accounting standards codification  or asc   compensation stock compensation  no valuation allowance has been recorded against this amount 
however  in the future  if the underlying amounts expire with an intrinsic value less than the fair value of the awards on the date of grant  some or all of the benefits may not be realizable 
as of december   the company has approximately million of federal net operating losses associated with the exercise of stock options which have not yet been recorded as deferred tax assets  and may be used to offset federal taxable income in future periods 
we would recognize this benefit as an increase in additional paid in capital when it results in a reduction in federal taxable income 
as of december   we had state research and development tax credits of million related to excess tax deductions  the benefit of these credits will be realized as an increase in additional paid in capital when it results in a reduction in state taxable income 
these state tax credits begin to expire in  and are subject to review and possible adjustment by the taxing authorities 
during  we both generated and utilized all of our us federal research and development tax credits 

table of contents requirements capital expenditures 
we have made capital expenditures primarily for equipment to support product development  evaluation systems for sales opportunities  improvements to our leased corporate headquarters in bedford  massachusetts  development of a new enterprise resource planning system and other general purposes to support our growth 
our capital expenditures totaled million in  million in  and million in we estimate capital expenditures to range between and million in contractual obligations and requirements 
our only material contractual obligation relates to the lease of our corporate headquarters in bedford  massachusetts 
the company is party to a lease with mscp crosby  llc  dated as of november   or the lease  as amended by the first amendment to lease dated as of july   amended by the second amendment to lease dated as of june   and further amended by the third amendment to lease dated as of june  the premises leased pursuant to the lease  as amended  consist of  rentable square feet of space in the building located at crosby drive  bedford  massachusetts

recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb amended asc  intangibles goodwill and other 
this amendment is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the annual goodwill impairment test by providing entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary 
the amended provisions are effective for reporting periods beginning on or after december  however  early adoption is permitted if an entity s financial statements for the most recent annual or interim period have not yet been issued 
we elected early adoption of this amendment  and such adoption did not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the fasb amended asc  comprehensive income 
this amendment was issued to enhance comparability between entities that report under gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs and to provide a more consistent method of presenting non owner transactions that affect an entity s 
table of contents equity 
the amendment requires companies to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income either as one continuous statement or as two separate but consecutive statements 
it eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components as part of the statement of changes in shareholders equity 
the amended provisions are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  early adoption is permitted  and full retrospective application is required 
this amendment impacts presentation and disclosure only  and therefore adoption will not have an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued asu no

the amendments in this update apply to all reporting entities that are required or permitted to measure or disclose the fair value of an asset  a liability  or an instrument classified in a reporting entity s shareholders equity in the financial statements 
asu no 
does not extend the use of fair value accounting  but provides guidance on how it should be applied where its use is already required or permitted by other standards within us gaap or ifrs 
asu no 
changes the wording used to describe many requirements in us gaap for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
additionally  asu no 
clarifies the fasb s intent about the application of existing fair value measurements 
the amendments in this update are to be applied prospectively 
for public entities  the amendments are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after december  early application by public entities is not permitted 
we do not currently expect the provisions of asu no 
to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
foreign currency exchange risk to date  substantially all of our international customer agreements have been denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  we have limited exposure to foreign currency exchange rates and do not enter into foreign currency hedging transactions 
the functional currency of our international operations in europe asia and canada is the us dollar 
accordingly  all operating assets and liabilities of these international subsidiaries are remeasured into us dollars using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date or historical rate  as appropriate 
revenue and expenses of these international subsidiaries are remeasured into us dollars at the average rates in effect during the year 
any differences resulting from the remeasurement of assets  liabilities and operations of the european  asian and canadian subsidiaries are recorded within other income in the consolidated statements of income 
if the foreign currency exchange rates fluctuated by as of december   our foreign exchange exposure would have fluctuated by approximately than  interest rate risk at december   we had unrestricted cash  cash equivalents  short and long term investments totaling million 
these amounts were invested primarily in high quality securities of a short duration and are not materially affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
the cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
due to the short nature of our short term investments and low current market yields of our long term investments  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  would reduce future interest income
