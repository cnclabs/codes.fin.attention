overview key financial results for were as follows our results for the year ended december  reflect revenue growth  gross margin improvement  and reduced operating expenses as a percentage of revenue 
we completed our acquisition of alphagraph on december   prism on august   entrac on july   and streamline on february  their results are included in our results of operations subsequent to those respective acquisition dates 

table of contents our consolidated revenue increased by approximately  or million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  consisting of increased fiery  inkjet  and apps revenue of   and million  respectively 
fiery revenue increased by primarily due to strong demand for current products from each of the leading printer manufacturers  increased revenue from stand alone and embedded servers and proofing software  and to a lesser extent  our acquisition of entrac  which was acquired during the third quarter of the fiery segment continues to benefit by the transition from analog to digital technology 
inkjet revenue increased by primarily due to increased sales of super wide format printers and digital uv ink 
the uv printer and ink revenue increase resulted from the ongoing migration of analog  as well as the ongoing transition from solvent based to uv curable based printing and from uv curing to uv led curing 
digital uv ink revenue increased as a result of the high utilization that our uv printers are experiencing in the field  partially offset by decreased solvent printer installed base demand measured by solvent ink usage 
apps revenue increased by primarily due to our acquisition strategy in the apps operating segment  as well as increased pace  monarch  radius  and web to print revenue 
apps revenue benefited from our acquisition of prism  which closed during the third quarter of and to a lesser extent  our acquisition of streamline  which closed during the first quarter of  and to a lesser extent  our acquisition of alphagraph  which closed during the fourth quarter of the acquisitions of prism and alphagraph in and radius in have led to an increased international presence for our apps business 
the gross profit percentage improved by percentage points from in to in primarily due to improved inkjet operating segment gross profit percentages of during the fourth quarter  compared to in the prior year 
the inkjet gross profit percentage improved compared with the prior year primarily due to fixed manufacturing costs being spread over higher inkjet revenue and reduced warranty exposure  which resulted from improved product performance  partially offset by engineering design modifications to improve quality 
the inkjet gross profit percentage also increased due to the million charge for excess solvent inventories and related end of life purchases in  as a result of the accelerating transition from solvent to uv technology 
operating expenses as a percent of revenue decreased from in to in operating expenses increased by million between and  but decreased as a percentage of revenue due to the increase in revenue during the corresponding periods 
the increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by head count increases related to the alphagraph  prism  entrac  and streamline acquisitions  reinstatement of salaries and benefits reduced during the economic downturn  variable compensation due to improved profitability  commission payments resulting from increased revenue  non recurring engineering expenses related to our product launches  change in fair value of contingent consideration related to our radius acquisition  and increased stock based compensation expense 
interest and other income expense  net  increased by million primarily driven by the sale of a minority investment in a privately held company for million because the investment was no longer considered to be strategic and million decrease in unfavorable realized and unrealized foreign exchange fluctuations primarily resulting from our euro and british pound sterling denominated assets and liabilities including intercompany loans  partially offset by million of investment gains realized in we recorded a tax provision of million in on pre tax income of million compared to a tax benefit of million in on a pre tax loss of million 
the change from to primarily related to the decreased benefit realized from the recognition of million of previously unrecognized tax benefits in  compared with million recognized in and the impact of the increase in pre tax operating income in the current year

overview revenue was   and million for the years ended december    and  respectively  resulting in a increase in compared with and a increase in compared with the million increase in compared with consisted of increased fiery  inkjet  and apps revenue of   and million  respectively 
the million increase in compared with consisted of increased fiery  inkjet  and apps revenue of   and million  respectively 
fiery revenue fiery revenue increased by million  or  in compared with  as the fiery operating segment continues to benefit from the conversion from analog to digital technology 
the fiery operating segment has experienced strong demand in for current products from the leading printer manufacturers and increased revenue from stand alone and embedded servers and proofing software 
fiery revenue benefited to a lesser extent from the entrac acquisition  which closed during the third quarter of fiery revenue increased by million  or  in compared with  primarily driven by strong demand for our digital color controllers in the high end production market 
new and refreshed printer manufacturer engine launches contributed to the revenue increase 
inkjet revenue inkjet revenue increased by million  or  in compared with  across all of our inkjet product lines encompassing increased printer  digital uv ink  and service part sales 
following the successful introduction of the gs series of super wide format printers in  we continued to extend the gs product family in and with led technology on our hybrid gs  as well as a gs roll to roll version 
in addition  we introduced new printing solutions including textile and entry level production uv hybrid printers 
coming out of the downturn  the transition from solvent based printing to uv curable based printing and the transition from uv curing to uv led curing has continued to accelerate 
the digital uv ink and service part sales increase reflects the high utilization that our uv printers are experiencing in the field  which is partially offset by a decreased solvent printer installed base demand  also measured by solvent ink usage and service parts 

table of contents inkjet revenue increased by million  or  in compared with  primarily due to gs series printer sales and significantly increased uv printer and ink sales 
apps revenue apps revenue increased by million  or  in compared with  primarily due to internally generated revenue increases with respect to the pace  monarch  radius  and web to print products 
apps revenue benefited from our acquisition of prism  which closed during the third quarter of and to a lesser extent  our acquisitions of streamline and alphagraph  which closed during the first and fourth quarters of  respectively 
apps recurring revenue includes subscription revenue and maintenance fees 
apps revenue increased by million  or  in compared with  due to revenue realized from our acquisition of radius  in addition to increased pace and web to print revenue 
our revenue by geographic area for the years ended december    and was as follows in thousands for the years ended december  change over over americas emea asia pacific japan rest of world row total revenue compared with our consolidated revenue increase of million  or  in compared with  resulted from double digit percentage growth in americas  emea  and row resulting from increased revenue in all three operating segments  partially offset by decreased revenue in japan 
the and fiery and inkjet product launches mitigated the impact of the weak economic environment in the operating segment geographic breakdown in remained comparable to with the exception of the decrease in japan 
americas revenue increased by million  or  in compared with americas revenue increased due to double digit percentage revenue increases in all three of our operating segments 
emea revenue increased by million  or  in compared with  due to double digit percentage revenue growth in all three of our operating segments 
fiery revenue in emea increased due to strong demand for current products from the leading printer manufacturers and increased revenue from stand alone and embedded servers and proofing software 
inkjet revenue growth in emea was primarily driven by increased sales of our super wide format printers  digital uv ink  and parts 
our apps emea customer base has increased significantly as a result of the alphagraph and prism acquisitions and benefited from an expanded international sales force acquired with the alphagraph  prism  and radius acquisitions 
japan revenue decreased by million  or  in compared with  primarily due to decreased fiery and inkjet revenue resulting from the poor economy in japan and delayed sales and supply constraints resulting from the march earthquake and tsunami 

table of contents row revenue increased by million  or  in compared with  primarily due to increased demand for fiery and inkjet products in china and the rest of asia 
we have expanded our international sales force as a result of the alphagraph  prism  and radius acquisitions 
in the individual regions  fiery revenue represented    and of revenue in the americas  emea  japan  and row  respectively  compared with    and of revenue 
inkjet revenue represented    and of revenue in the americas  emea  japan  and row  respectively  compared with    and of revenue 
apps revenue represented    and of revenue in the americas  emea  japan  and row  respectively  compared with    and of revenue 
compared with our consolidated revenue increase of million  or  in compared with  resulted from double digit percentage growth in all three operating segments 
the operating segment geographic breakdown in remained comparable to comparing to  americas  emea  japan  and row revenue increased by    and  respectively 
revenue rebounded in across all regions and all operating segments within each region 
new fiery and inkjet product launches mitigated the impact of the weak economic environment in revenue had previously declined in primarily due to weakness in fiery sales caused by reduced demand from the leading printer manufacturers due to the slow economy  weak inkjet sales due to the tight global credit market  and the decline in global marketing spending 
shipments to some of our significant printer manufacturer customers are made to centralized purchasing and manufacturing locations  which in turn ship to other locations  making it difficult to obtain accurate geographical shipment data 
accordingly  we believe that export sales of our products into each region may differ from what is reported 
we expect that sales outside of the us will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenue 
although end customer and reseller channel preference for fiery products drives demand  most fiery revenue relies on printer manufacturers to design  develop  and integrate fiery technology into their print engines 
a significant portion of our revenue is  and has been  generated by sales of our fiery printer and copier related products to a relatively small number of leading printer manufacturers 
xerox and ricoh each provided more than of our revenue individually and together accounted for of our revenue for the year ended december  xerox and canon each contributed over of our revenue and together accounted for approximately and of our revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the percentage of business driven by our end customers through the leading printer manufacturers as  in effect  distributors of our products has leveled off in recent years after decreasing for several years previously 
in   and  of our revenue was from other sources 
during  on a quarterly basis  revenue from these leading printer manufacturers decreased from in the first quarter to by the fourth quarter with revenue from other sources increasing from in the first quarter to by the fourth quarter 
over time  we expect our revenue from the leading printer manufacturers to continue to decline 
because sales of our printer and copier related products constitute a significant portion of our revenue and there are a limited number of printer manufacturers producing copiers and printers in sufficient volume to be attractive customers for us  we expect that we will continue to depend on a relatively small number of printer manufacturers for a significant portion of our fiery controller revenue in future periods 
accordingly  if we lose or experience reduced sales to one of these printer manufacturer distributors  we will have difficulty replacing that revenue with sales to new or existing customers and our fiery revenue will likely decline significantly 

table of contents our reliance on revenue from the leading printer manufacturers decreased throughout the year ended december  because the inkjet and apps revenue increases were greater than the fiery revenue increase in both percentage and absolute dollars 
although end customer and reseller channel preference for fiery products drives demand  most fiery revenue relies on the leading printer manufacturers to design  develop  and integrate fiery technology into their print engine as described above 
no assurance can be given that our relationships with these and other printer manufacturers will continue or that we will be successful in increasing the number of printer manufacturing customers or the size of our existing relationships 
several of our printer manufacturing customers have reduced their purchases from us at various times in the past and any of these printer manufacturers or other customers could do so in the future as there are no contractual commitments to purchase our products in significant amounts  or at all 
such reductions have occurred in the past and could in the future have a significant negative impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
we expect that if we continue to increase our revenue in the inkjet and apps operating segments  the percentage of our revenue from printer manufacturing customers will decrease 
we intend to continue to develop new products and technologies for each of our product lines including new generations of server and controller products  super wide and wide format printers  and other new product lines  and to distribute those new products to or through current and new printer manufacturers  distributors  and end users in and beyond 
no assurance can be given that the introduction or market acceptance of current or future products will be successful 
if sales of our products do not grow over time in absolute terms  or if we are not able to meet demand for higher unit volumes  it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
there can be no assurance that products that we introduce in the future will successfully compete  be accepted by the market  or otherwise effectively replace the volume of revenue and or income from our older products 
market acceptance of our software products  products acquired through acquisitions  and other products cannot be assured 
in addition  we may experience potential loss of sales  unexpected costs  or adverse impact on relationships with customers or suppliers as a result of acquisitions 
we also believe that in addition to the factors described above  price reductions for our products will affect revenue in the future 
we have previously reduced  and in the future will likely change  prices for our products 
depending on the price elasticity of demand for our products  the pricing and quality of competitive products  and other economic and competitive conditions  price changes have had  and may in the future have  an adverse impact on our revenue and profits

total gross profit for the year ended december  has not changed 
overview our gross profit percentages were   and for the years ended   and  respectively 
our gross profit percentage improved by percentage points in  as compared with  primarily due to a percentage point increase in the inkjet gross profit percentage  a percentage point increase in the apps gross profit percentage  and increased fiery revenue 
all three operating segments contributed to the small increase in the gross profit percentage in  as compared with fiery gross profit the fiery gross profit percentage of in was comparable to in the increase in fiery revenue dollars aided the consolidated gross profit percentage due to the fixed component included within the fiery cost of revenue 
the fiery gross profit percentage increased from in to in primarily due to a mix shift toward stand alone servers  which have higher margins than embedded servers  partially offset by the costs to launch new products 
inkjet gross profit the inkjet gross profit percentage increased from in to in the improvement in the inkjet gross profit percentage compared with the prior year is primarily due to fixed manufacturing costs being spread over higher inkjet revenue and reduced warranty exposure  which resulted from improved product performance  partially offset by engineering design modifications to improve quality 
the inkjet gross profit percentage also increased due to the million write off of excess solvent inventories and related end of life purchases during  as a result of the accelerating transition from solvent to uv technology 

table of contents the inkjet gross profit percentage increased from in to in improving inkjet gross profit was primarily due to fixed manufacturing costs spread over higher inkjet revenue  higher selling prices for new products launched in  and favorable product mix shift toward higher margin printers  partially offset by engineering design modifications to improve quality and reduce warranty exposure and the million provision for excess solvent inventories and related end of life purchases resulting from the accelerating transition from solvent to uv technology 
apps gross profit the increase in the apps gross profit percentage from in to in was primarily due to efficiencies gained through increased revenue 
apps revenue increased from of total revenue in to of total revenue in the increase in the apps gross profit percentage from in to in was also primarily due to efficiencies gained through increased revenue 
apps revenue was of total revenue in  which was comparable to  but the increase in revenue dollars aided the gross profit percentage due to the fixed component included within the apps cost of revenue 
if our product mix changes significantly  our gross profit will fluctuate 
in addition  gross profit can be impacted by a variety of other factors 
these factors include market prices achieved on our current and future products  availability and pricing of key components including memory subsystems  processors  and print heads  subcontractor manufacturing costs  product mix  distribution channel  geographic mix  product transition results  new product introductions  competition  business acquisitions  and general economic conditions in the us and abroad 
consequently  gross profit may fluctuate from period to period 
in addition  if we reduce prices  gross profit could be lower 
many of our products and sub assemblies are manufactured by subcontract manufacturers that purchase most of the necessary components 
if our subcontract manufacturers cannot obtain necessary components at favorable prices  we could experience increased product costs 
we purchase certain components directly  including processors  memory subsystems  certain asics  and software licensed from various sources  including adobe postscript software

sales and marketing head count was   and as of december    and  respectively  including   and in customer service for each of the years presented 
over time  our sales and marketing expenses may increase in absolute terms if revenue increases in future periods as we continue to actively promote our products and introduce new products and services 
we expect that if the us dollar remains volatile against the euro  british pound sterling  and other currencies  sales and marketing expenses reported in us dollars could fluctuate 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs associated with human resources  legal  and finance expenses

acquisition related costs of million were expensed in in connection with our acquisition of radius 
the remaining million reduction in general and administrative expenses is due to focused effort on cost reduction in all areas 
updated probability adjusted revenue estimates indicate that the radius earnout performance targets were achieved 
consequently  the fair value of the radius earnout increased by million as of december  in accordance with asc  changes in the fair value of contingent consideration subsequent to the acquisition date have been recognized in general and administrative expense 
we expect that if the us dollar remains volatile against the euro  british pound sterling  indian rupee or other currencies  general and administrative expenses reported in us dollars could fluctuate 
stock based compensation we account for stock based payment awards in accordance with asc  stock compensation  which requires stock based compensation expense to be recognized based on the fair value of such awards on the date of grant 
we amortize stock based compensation cost on a graded vesting basis over the vesting period  after assessing the probability of achieving requisite performance criteria with respect to performance based awards 
stock based compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award as though the award were  in substance  multiple awards 
this has the impact of greater stock based compensation expense during the initial years of the vesting period 
stock based compensation expense for the years ended december    and were million  or of revenue  million  or of revenue  and million  or of revenue  respectively 
stock based compensation expense increased million  or  in as compared with due to new equity awards granted with relatively higher fair value driven by the increase in the trading price of our stock and a true up of estimated forfeitures 
stock based compensation expense decreased million  or  in as compared with due to fewer equity awards granted in with a relatively lower fair value driven by the decrease in the trading price of our stock 
as explained in more detail above  amortization of stock based compensation expense under the graded vesting method results in more significant expense in the initial years of vesting 
amortization of identified intangibles amortization of identified intangibles for the years ended december    and was million  or of revenue  million  or of revenue  and million  or of revenue  respectively

under the agreement  we sold the approximately  square foot building at velocity way  as well as approximately acres of related land and certain other assets related to the property 
the cost of the land  building  improvements  and direct transaction costs were included in the determination of the million gain on sale of building and land 
goodwill impairment we perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of each year according to the provisions of asc a two step impairment test of goodwill is required 
in the first step  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
if the fair value exceeds carrying value  goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not required 
if the carrying value exceeds fair value  then the second step of the impairment test is required to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the reporting unit  excluding goodwill  from the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in the first step 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then an impairment loss must be recorded equal to the difference 
our goodwill valuation analysis is based on our respective reporting units fiery  inkjet  and apps  which are consistent with our operating segments identified in note segment information  geographic data  and major customers of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we determined the fair value of our reporting units as of december  by equally weighting the market and income approaches 
under the market approach  we estimated fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings of comparable companies 
under the income approach  we estimated fair value based on a projected cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
based on our valuation results  we have determined that the fair values of our reporting units exceed their carrying values 
fiery  inkjet  and apps fair values are   and million  respectively  which exceed carrying value by   and  respectively 
to identify suitable comparable companies under the market approach  consideration was given to the financial condition and operating performance of the reporting unit being evaluated relative to companies operating in the same or similar businesses  potentially subject to corresponding economic  environmental  and political factors and considered to be reasonable investment alternatives 
consideration was given to the investment characteristics of the subject company relative to those of similar publicly traded companies ie  guideline companies  which are actively traded 
in applying the public company market multiple method pcmmm  valuation multiples were derived from historical and projected operating data of guideline companies and applied to the appropriate operating data of our reporting units to arrive at an indication of fair value 
five  four  and seven suitable guideline companies were identified for the fiery  inkjet  and apps reporting units  respectively 
while the fair value of the fiery  inkjet and apps reporting units exceeded their carrying value as of december  as indicated by the market based valuation  management determined to further examine whether an impairment had occurred given the inkjet impairment recognized in the fourth quarter of and the susceptibility of the apps reporting unit to fair value fluctuations 
we reviewed the factors that could trigger an impairment charge and completed an income based impairment analysis for all three reporting units 
as part of this process  we engaged a third party valuation firm to assist management in its analysis 
all estimates  key assumptions  and forecasts were either provided by or reviewed by us 
while we chose to utilize a third party valuation firm  the impairment analysis and related valuations represent the conclusions of management and not the conclusions or statements of any third party 

table of contents solely for purposes of establishing inputs for the income approach to assess the fair value of the fiery  inkjet  and apps reporting units  we made the following assumptions fiery and inkjet revenue approximated historical normalized growth rates in during  apps revenue growth of exceeded historical normalized growth rates due to several acquisitions completed in and despite the ongoing economic uncertainty  our reporting units revenue will grow at historical normalized rates between and for the following primary reasons the ongoing transition from analog to digital technology will enable our fiery revenue to grow at historical normalized rates in spite of the economic climate 
this transition is expected to continue through the forecast horizon 
fiery is also well positioned to achieve historical normalized growth rates due to our software solutions  including our self service and payment solution entrac 
as the leading world wide manufacturer of digital uv ink  our inkjet revenue is positioned to outpace the slow economy and achieve historical normalized growth rates due to the ongoing transition from solvent based to uv curable based printing and from uv curing to uv led curing 
this transition is expected to continue through the forecast horizon 
our acquisition strategy in the apps reporting unit will enable us to achieve historical normalized revenue growth rates through the forecast horizon 
our intention is to continue to explore additional acquisition opportunities in the apps operating segment to further consolidate the business process automation and cloud based order entry and order management software industries in both the americas and world wide 
long term industry growth after with the exception of fiery  which is conservatively assumed at long term growth rates by gross profit percentages will approximate historical average levels in the fiery and apps reporting units 
inkjet gross profit will remain at the percent level  which is the approximate level achieved in as we have resolved significant warranty issues and exposures 
our discounted cash flow projections were based on five year financial forecasts  which were based on annual financial forecasts developed internally by management for use in managing our business and through discussions with the valuation firm engaged by us 
the significant assumptions utilized in these five year financial forecasts included consolidated annual revenue growth rates ranging from to  which equates to a consolidated compound annual growth rate of 
these are our historical normalized growth rates 
future cash flows were discounted to present value using a mid year convention and a consolidated discount rate of 
terminal values were calculated using the gordon growth methodology with a consolidated long term growth rate of 
the sum of the fair values of the fiery  inkjet  and apps reporting units was reconciled to our current market capitalization based on our stock price plus an estimated control premium 
significant assumptions used in determining fair values of the reporting units under the market based and income based analyses include the determination of appropriate market comparables  estimated multiples of revenue and earnings before interest expense and taxes ebit that a willing buyer is likely to pay  estimated control premium a willing buyer is likely to pay  gross profit  and operating expenses 
gross profit and operating expenses as a percentage of revenue over the five year forecast horizon were compared to approximate percentages realized by the guideline companies 
to assess the reasonableness of the estimated control premium of  we examined the most similar transactions in relevant industries and determined the average premium indicated by the transactions deemed to be most similar to a hypothetical transaction involving our reporting units 
we examined the weighted average and median control premiums offered in relevant industries  industry specific control premiums  and specific transaction control premiums to conclude that our estimated control premium is reasonable 

table of contents we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable or the life of the asset may need to be revised 
factors considered important that could trigger an impairment review include significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  our market capitalization relative to net book value  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets  significant changes in the strategy for our overall business  and our assessment of growth and profitability in each reporting unit over the coming years 
given the uncertainty of the economic environment and the potential impact on our business  there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions regarding the duration of the ongoing economic downturn  or the period or strength of recovery  made for purposes of our goodwill impairment testing at december  will prove to be accurate predictions of the future 
if our assumptions regarding forecasted revenue or gross profit rates are not achieved  we may be required to record additional goodwill impairment charges in future periods relating to any of our reporting units  whether in connection with the next annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of or prior to that  if any such change constitutes an interim triggering event 
it is not possible to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or  if it does  whether such charge would be material 
since fair values were determined using a weighting of the market and income approaches  we reviewed the sensitivity of the market multiple and discount rate to evaluate the sensitivity of the fiery  inkjet  and apps valuations 
the impact of a change in the market multiple of results in either an increase in fiery  inkjet  and apps fair values of   or  respectively  or a decrease of   or  respectively 
likewise  the impact of a change in the discount rate of one percentage point results in either an increase in the fiery  inkjet  and apps fair values of   or  respectively  or a decrease of   or  respectively 
consequently  we have concluded that no reasonably possible changes would reduce the fair value of the reporting units to such a level that it would cause a failure in step one of the impairment analysis 
long lived asset impairment we evaluate potential impairment with respect to long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we recognized long lived asset impairment charges of and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  consisting primarily of project abandonment costs related to equipment charges in the inkjet operating segment  assets impaired related to an inkjet facility closure  and the impairment of our remaining equity method investees 
no asset impairment charges were recognized during the year ended december  other investments  included within other assets  consist of equity and debt investments in privately held companies that develop products  markets  and services that are strategic to us 
in substance common stock investments in which we exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies  but do not have a majority voting interest  are accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
investments not meeting these requirements are accounted for using the cost method of accounting 
we previously assessed each investment s technology pipeline and market conditions in the industry and determined it is no longer probable that they will generate sufficient positive future cash flows to recover the full carrying amount of the investment 
as such  we recognized an impairment charge of million 
during the second quarter of  we further assessed each remaining investment s ability to sustain an earnings capacity that would justify the carrying amount of the investment in accordance with asc  investments equity method and joint ventures subsequent measurement 
based on this assessment  we impaired the remaining carrying value of these investments of million 

table of contents income loss before income taxes income loss before income taxes for the years ended december    and were as follows in thousands for the years ended december  us foreign total for the year ended december   pre tax income of million consisted of us and foreign pre tax income of and million  respectively

the pre tax loss attributable to foreign operations included restructuring and other costs of million and amortization of identified intangibles of million 
provision for benefit from income taxes we recorded a tax provision of million in on pre tax income of million  compared to a tax benefit of million in on a pre tax loss of million  and a tax provision of million in on pre tax income of million 

table of contents the following table reconciles our provision for benefit from income taxes before discrete items to our provision for benefit from income taxes for the years ended december    and in millions for the years ended december  provision for benefit from income taxes before discrete items provision related to tax shortfalls recorded pursuant to asc  stock compensation income taxes provision related to gain on sale of minority investment in a privately held company provision related to gain on sale of building and land provision related to the election of california single sales factor interest related to unrecognized tax benefits benefit related to restructuring and other expense benefit related to acquisition expenses benefit related to asset impairment charges benefit related to excess solvent inventories and related end of life purchases tax deductions related to employee stock purchase plan espp dispositions benefit related to reassessment of taxes related to filing of prior year tax returns benefit related to reversals of uncertain tax positions due to statute of limitation expirations benefit related to reversals of accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions benefit related to net adjustments due to foreign audit settlements provision for benefit from income taxes in addition to the discrete benefits and charges listed above  we benefited from research and development credits in each of these years 
our taxes also decreased due to lower taxes on foreign income in and our taxes increased due to non deductible stock compensation charges in each of these years and decreased profitability in low tax jurisdictions in we earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the us  which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions 
most of this income is earned in the netherlands and the cayman islands  which are jurisdictions with tax rates materially lower than the statutory us tax rate of 
no change in our business operations is under consideration that would materially impact our results from operations 
our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly and be adversely impacted if anticipated earnings in the netherlands and the cayman islands are proportionally lower than current projections and earnings in all other jurisdictions are proportionally higher than current projections 
while we currently do not foresee a need to repatriate the earnings of these operations  should we require more capital in the us than is generated by our us operations  we may elect to repatriate funds held in our foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the us through debt or equity issuances 
these alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates  the cash payment of taxes  and or increased interest expense 

table of contents we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income by considering both positive and negative evidence relating to their recoverability 
if we believe that recovery of these deferred tax assets is not more likely than not  we establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we increase a valuation allowance in a period  we will include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which such determination is made 
significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all available evidence  including recent operating results  projections of future taxable income  our ability to utilize loss and credit carryforwards  and the feasibility of tax planning strategies 
a significant piece of objective positive evidence evaluated was cumulative pre tax income over a three year period ended december  in addition  we considered that loss and credit carryforwards have not expired unused and a majority of our loss and credit carryforwards will not expire prior to finally  we considered that our results from operations have improved each year since as a result of this evaluation  we have determined that it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit related to our deferred tax assets except for a valuation allowance on foreign tax credits resulting from the acquisition of best gmbh  compensation deductions potentially limited by us internal revenue code irc m  and net operating loss carryforwards resulting from the radius acquisition 
the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable could be negatively impacted if sufficient taxable income in the carryforward period is not generated 
unaudited non gaap financial information use of non gaap financial information to supplement our consolidated financial results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  we use non gaap measures of net income loss and earnings per diluted share that are gaap net income loss and gaap earnings per diluted share adjusted to exclude certain recurring and non recurring costs  expenses  and gains 
we believe that the presentation of non gaap net income loss and non gaap earnings per diluted share provides important supplemental information regarding non cash expenses and significant recurring and non recurring items that we believe are important to understanding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations 
non gaap net income loss and non gaap earnings per diluted share are among the primary indicators used by management as a basis for planning and forecasting future periods and by management and our board of directors to determine whether our operating performance has met specified targets and thresholds 
management uses non gaap net income loss and non gaap earnings per diluted share when evaluating operating performance because it believes the exclusion of the items described below  for which the amounts and or timing may vary significantly depending on the company s activities and other factors  facilitates comparability of the company s operating performance from period to period 
we have chosen to provide this information to investors so they can analyze our operating results in the same way that management does and use this information in their assessment of our business and the valuation of our company 
use and economic substance of non gaap financial measures we compute non gaap net income loss and non gaap earnings per diluted share by adjusting gaap net income loss and gaap earnings per diluted share to remove the impact of recurring amortization of acquisition related intangibles and stock based compensation expense  as well as restructuring related and non recurring charges and gains and the tax effect of these adjustments 
such non recurring charges and gains include end of life solvent inventory purchases and related obsolescence  asset impairment  sale of a non strategic minority investment in a privately held company  acquisition related transaction costs  and costs to integrate such acquisitions into our business 

table of contents these excluded items are described below recurring charges and gains  including amortization of acquisition related intangibles 
intangible assets acquired to date are being amortized on a straight line basis 
stock based compensation expense recognized in accordance with asc non recurring charges and gains  including provision for excess solvent inventories and related end of life purchases resulting from the accelerating transition from solvent based printing to uv curable based printing 
restructuring and other consists of restructuring related charges 
we have incurred restructuring charges as we reduced the number and size of our facilities and the size of our workforce 
expenses incurred to integrate businesses acquired during the periods reported 
acquisition related transaction costs associated with businesses acquired during the periods reported and cretaprint  which was acquired subsequent to year end 
asset impairment costs consist primarily of equipment and non cancellable purchase orders relating to a planned inkjet product that was cancelled  a facility closure  and the impairment of a private minority investment 
we have excluded approximately million from our non gaap operating results related to the change in the fair value of the radius acquisition contingent consideration 
our management determined that when analyzing operating results of an acquired entity  we should focus on the total return provided by the investment ie  operating profit generated from the acquired entity compared to the purchase price paid  including the final amounts paid for contingent consideration without considering any expenses recognized post acquisition related to the change in the fair value of the contingent consideration 
our management determined that because the final purchase price paid for an acquisition necessarily reflects the accounting value assigned to both contingent consideration and to the intangible assets  when analyzing the operating results of an acquisition in subsequent periods  we should exclude the gaap impact of any adjustments to the fair value of acquisition related contingent consideration from its financial results 
we believe this approach is useful in understanding the long term return provided by an acquisition and that investors benefit from a supplemental non gaap financial measure that excludes the impact of this adjustment 
gain on sale of minority investment in a privately held company 
other investments  included within other assets  consist of equity and debt investments in privately held companies that develop products  markets  and services that are considered to be strategic to us 
each of these investments had been fully impaired in prior years 
on september   we sold one of these investments for million because it was no longer considered to be strategic 
gain on sale of building and land 
we sold a portion of the foster city  california campus for million resulting in a gain on sale of million for the year ended december  tax effect of non gaap adjustments after excluding the items described above  we apply the principles of asc  income taxes  to estimate the non gaap income tax benefit provision in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
we have excluded the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits of and million  and we have also excluded interest expense accrued on prior year reserves of and million  from our non gaap net income loss for the years ended december  and 
table of contents  respectively  to facilitate comparability of our operating performance between the years 
these tax benefits primarily arose from the release of previously unrecognized tax benefits resulting from the expiration of us federal and state statutes of limitations 
we have excluded other tax benefits of million from our non gaap net income for the year ended december  usefulness of non gaap financial information to investors these non gaap measures are not in accordance with or an alternative to gaap and may be materially different from other non gaap measures  including similarly titled non gaap measures  used by other companies 
the presentation of this additional information should not be considered in isolation from  as a substitute for  or superior to  net income loss or earnings per diluted share prepared in accordance with gaap 
non gaap financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect certain items that may have a material impact on our reported financial results 
we expect to continue to incur expenses of a nature similar to the non gaap adjustments described above  and exclusion of these items from our non gaap net income loss and non gaap earnings per diluted share should not be construed as an inference that these costs are unusual  infrequent  or non recurring

revenue recognition 
we derive our revenue primarily from product revenue  which includes hardware controllers  design licensed solutions including upgrades  digital industrial inkjet printers including components replaced under maintenance agreements  and ink  software licensing and development  and royalties 
we receive service revenue from software license maintenance agreements  printer maintenance agreements  customer support  training  professional services  and consulting 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences could result in the amount and timing of revenue for any period if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
we recognize revenue on the sale of controllers  printers  and ink in accordance with the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition sab  and when applicable  asc  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements 
as such  revenue is generally recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
products generally must be shipped against written purchase orders 
we use either a binding purchase order or signed contract as evidence of an arrangement 
sales to some of the leading printer manufacturers are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with a binding purchase order 
sales to our resellers are also evidenced by binding purchase orders or signed contracts and do not generally contain rights of return or price protection 
our arrangements generally do not include product acceptance clauses 
when acceptance is required  revenue is recognized when the product is accepted by the customer 
delivery of hardware generally is complete when title and risk of loss is transferred at point of shipment from manufacturing facilities  or when the product is delivered to the customer s local common carrier 
we also sell products and services using sales arrangements with terms resulting in different timing for revenue recognition as follows if the title and or risk of loss is transferred at a location other than our manufacturing facility  revenue is recognized when title and or risk of loss transfers to the customer  per the terms of the agreement  if title is retained until payment is received  revenue is recognized when title is passed upon receipt of payment  if the sales arrangement is classified as an operating lease  revenue is recognized ratably over the lease term  or 
table of contents if the sales arrangement is a fixed price for performance extending over a long period and our right to receive future payment depends on our future performance in accordance with these agreements  revenue is recognized under the percentage of completion method 
we deferred an immaterial amount of revenue during the years ended december    and because a portion of the customer payment was contingent upon installation 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the terms of the contract or purchase order 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer  the creditworthiness of the customer  customer concentrations  current economic trends and macroeconomic conditions  changes in customer payment terms  the length of time receivables are past due  and significant one time events 
we may not request collateral from our customers  although down payments are generally required from inkjet and apps customers as a means to ensure payment 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue when collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
we license our software primarily under perpetual licenses 
revenue from software consists of software licensing  post contract customer support  and professional consulting 
we apply the provisions of asc  software revenue recognition and  if applicable  sab and asc  to all transactions involving the sale of software products and hardware transactions where the software is not incidental 
we enter into contracts to sell our products and services  and  while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions  there are agreements that contain multiple elements or non standard terms and conditions 
as a result  significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting  including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and  if so  how the price should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize revenue for each element 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the delivered elements have standalone value  uncertainties regarding customer acceptance are resolved  and there are no customer negotiated refund or return rights for the delivered elements 
if the arrangement includes a customer negotiated refund or right of return relative to the delivered item and the delivery and performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in our control  the delivered element constitutes a separate unit of accounting 
we limit revenue recognition for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services  future performance obligations  or subject to customer specified return or refund privileges 
changes in the allocation of the sales price between elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition  but will not change the total revenue recognized on the contract 
multiple deliverable arrangements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb ratified emerging issues task force eitf consensuses reflected in accounting standards update asu  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asc  and asu  certain revenue arrangements that include software elements asc 
we adopted these provisions as of the beginning of fiscal for new and materially modified transactions originating after january  asu eliminated the residual method of allocating revenue in multiple deliverable arrangements 
in accordance with asu  we recognize revenue in multiple element arrangements involving tangible products containing software and non software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality by applying the relative selling price method of allocation 
the selling price for each element is determined using vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of the selling price vsoe  when available including post contract customer support  professional services  hosting  and training  or third party evidence of the selling price tpe is used 
if vsoe and tpe are not available  then the best estimate of the selling price besp is used when applying the relative selling price method for each unit of accounting 
when the arrangement includes software and non software elements  revenue is first allocated to the 
table of contents non software and software elements as a group based on their relative selling price in accordance with asc thereafter  the relative selling price allocated to the software elements as a group is further allocated to each unit of accounting in accordance with asc we then defer revenue with respect to the relative selling price that was allocated to any undelivered element 
we have calculated besp for software licenses and non software deliverables 
we considered several different methods of establishing besp including cost plus a reasonable margin and stand alone selling price of the same or similar products and  if available  targeted rate of return  list price less discount  and company published list prices to identify the most appropriate representation of the estimated selling price of our products 
due to the wide range of pricing offered to our customers  we determined that selling price of the same or similar products  list price less discount  and company published list prices were not appropriate methods to determine besp for our products 
cost plus a reasonable margin and targeted rate of return were eliminated due to the difficulty in determining the cost associated with the intangible elements of each product s cost structure 
as a result  management believes that the best estimate of the selling price of an element is based on the median sales price of deliverables sold in stand alone transactions and or separately priced deliverables contained in bundled arrangements 
elements sold as stand alone transactions and in bundled arrangements during the last three months of and first nine months of were included in the calculation of besp 
when historical data is unavailable to calculate and support the determination of besp on a newly introduced or customized product  then besp of similar products is substituted for revenue allocation purposes 
we offer customization for some of our products 
customization does not have a significant impact on the discounting or pricing of our products 
asu determined that tangible products containing software and non software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality are not required to follow the software revenue recognition guidance in asc as long as the hardware components of the tangible product substantively contribute to its functionality 
in addition  hardware components of a tangible product containing software components shall always be excluded from the guidance in asc non software elements are accounted for in accordance with sab we have not changed our accounting policy with respect to multiple element arrangements that do not include the sale of tangible products 
the residual method requires that multiple element arrangements containing only software elements remain subject to the provisions of asc when several elements  including software licenses  post contract customer support  hosting  and professional services  are sold to a customer through a single contract  the revenue from such multiple element arrangements are allocated to each element using the residual method in accordance with asc revenue is allocated to the support elements and professional service elements of an agreement using vsoe and to the software license elements of the agreement using the residual method 
we have established vsoe for professional services and hosting based on the rates charged to our customers in stand alone orders 
we have also established vsoe for post contract customer support based on substantive renewal rates 
accordingly  software license fees are recognized under the residual method for arrangements in which the software was licensed with maintenance and or professional services  and where the maintenance and professional services were not essential to the functionality of the delivered software 
prior to adoption of asu and  tangible products containing software and non software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality were subject to the software revenue recognition guidance with respect to multiple element arrangements in asc we have insignificant transactions where tangible and software products are sold together in a bundled arrangement 
during the year ended december   we deferred million of revenue related to certain bundled arrangements accounted for under asu and we are not able to reasonably estimate the effect of adopting these standards on future periods as the impact will vary if we modify or develop new go to market strategies or pricing practices  which could impact vsoe and besp resulting in a different allocation of revenue to the deliverables in multiple element arrangements  but will not change the total revenue recognized for such arrangements 

table of contents subscription arrangements we have subscription arrangements where the customer pays a fixed fee and receives services over a period of time 
we recognize subscription revenue ratably over the service period 
any up front setup fees associated with our subscription arrangements are recognized ratably  generally over one year 
any up front setup fees that are not associated with our subscription arrangements are recognized upon completion 
long term contracts involving substantial customization during the quarter ended september   we established the ability to produce estimates sufficiently dependable to require adoption of the percentage of completion method with respect to certain fixed price contracts 
we previously followed the completed contract method of revenue recognition on long term contracts involving substantial customization 
revenue on certain fixed price contracts where we provide information technology system development and implementation services is recognized over the contract term based on the percentage of development and implementation services that are provided during the period compared with the total estimated development and implementation services to be provided over the entire contract using guidance from asc  revenue recognition construction type and production type contracts 
these services require that we perform significant  extensive  and complex design  development  modification  or implementation activities of our customers systems 
performance will often extend over long periods  and our right to receive future payment depends on our future performance in accordance with these agreements 
the percentage of completion method involves recognizing probable and reasonably estimable revenue using the percentage of services completed based on the current cumulative cost as a percentage of the estimated total cost  using a reasonably consistent profit margin over the period 
due to the long term nature of these projects  developing the estimates of costs often requires significant judgment 
factors that must be considered in estimating the progress of work completed and ultimate cost of the projects include  but are not limited to  the availability of labor and labor productivity  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  and the impact of delayed performance 
if changes occur in delivery  productivity  or other factors used in developing the estimates of costs or revenue  we revise our cost and revenue estimates  which may result in increases or decreases in revenue and costs  and such revisions are reflected in income in the period in which the facts that give rise to that revision become known 
we recognize losses on long term fixed price contracts in the period that the contractual loss becomes probable and estimable 
we record amounts invoiced to customers in excess of revenue recognized as deferred revenue until the revenue recognition criteria are met 
we record revenue that is earned and recognized in excess of amounts invoiced on fixed price contracts as trade receivables 
deferred revenue and related deferred costs deferred revenue represents amounts received in advance for product support contracts  software customer support contracts  consulting and integration projects  or product sales 
product support contracts include standalone product support packages  routine maintenance service contracts  and upgrades or extensions to standard product warranties 
we defer these amounts when we invoice the customer and then generally recognize revenue either ratably over the support contract life  upon performing the related services  in accordance with the percentage of completion method  or in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
deferred cost of revenue related to unrecognized revenue on shipments to customers was million at december  and is included in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet 
deferred cost of revenue related to unrecognized revenue on shipments to customers was immaterial at december  allowances for doubtful accounts 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts to ensure that trade receivables are not overstated due to uncollectibility 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns of million  as of december  
table of contents to ensure that we have established an adequate allowance for doubtful accounts  management analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and macroeconomic conditions  changes in customer payment terms  the length of time receivables are past due  and significant one time events 
we record specific reserves for individual accounts when we become aware of specific customer circumstances  such as bankruptcy filings  deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position  or potential unfavorable outcomes from disputes with customers or vendors 
our fiery products  which constitute approximately of our revenue  are primarily sold to a limited number of leading printer manufacturers 
although end customer and reseller channel preference for fiery products drives demand  most fiery revenue relies on these significant printer manufacturer distributors to design  develop  and integrate fiery technology into the their print engines 
we expect that we will continue to depend on a relatively small number of leading printer manufacturers for a significant portion of our revenue  although the significance of that dependence is expected to decline in future periods as our revenue increases from inkjet and apps products 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of the financial condition of our printer manufacturer  third party distributor  reseller  and other customers and require collateral  such as letters of credit and bank guarantees  in certain circumstances 
the past due or delinquency status of a receivable is based on the contractual payment terms of the receivable 
the evaluation of whether to write off a receivable balance depends on the age  size  and a determination of collectibility of the receivable 
we generally have experienced longer accounts receivable collection cycles in our inkjet and apps operating segments compared to our fiery operating segment as  historically  the leading printer manufacturers have paid on a more timely basis 
down payments are generally required from inkjet and apps customers as a means to ensure payment 
inventory reserves 
management estimates potential future inventory obsolescence and purchase commitments to evaluate the need for inventory reserves 
current economic trends  changes in customer demand  product design changes  product life and demand  and the acceptance of our products are analyzed to evaluate the adequacy of such reserves 
significant management judgment and estimates must be made in connection with establishing inventory allowances and reserves in any accounting period 
material differences may result in changes in the amount and timing of our net income loss for any period  if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
our inventories were million  net of inventory reserves of million  as of december  warranty reserves 
our fiery controller and inkjet printer products are generally accompanied by a month limited warranty from date of shipment  which covers both parts and labor 
in accordance with asc  loss contingencies  an accrual is required when the warranty liability is estimable and probable based upon historical experience 
a provision for estimated future warranty work is recorded in cost of revenue when revenue is recognized 
the warranty liability is reviewed regularly and periodically adjusted to reflect changes in warranty estimates 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made in connection with establishing and updating warranty reserves including estimated potential inventory return rates and replacement or repair costs 
material differences may result in changes in the amount and timing of our income for any period  if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
warranty reserves were million as of december  litigation accruals 
we may be involved  from time to time  in a variety of claims  lawsuits  investigations  or proceedings relating to contractual disputes  securities laws  intellectual property rights  employment  or other matters that may arise in the normal course of business 
we assess our potential liability in each of these matters by using the information available to us 
we develop our views on estimated losses in consultation with inside and outside counsel  which involves a subjective analysis of potential results and various combinations of appropriate litigation and settlement strategies 
we accrue estimated losses from contingencies if a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated 

table of contents the material assumptions used to estimate the required litigation accrual include communication with our external attorneys regarding the expected duration of the lawsuit  the potential outcome of the lawsuit  and the likelihood of settlement  our strategy regarding the lawsuit  deductible amounts under our insurance policies  and past experiences with similar lawsuits 
litigation is inherently unpredictable  and while we believe that we have valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against us  our financial statements could be materially affected in any particular period by the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these contingencies or because of the diversion of management s attention and the incurrence of significant expenses 
restructuring reserves 
we have engaged  and may continue to engage  in restructuring actions  which require management to utilize significant estimates related to the timing and the expense for severance and other employee separation costs  realizable values of assets made obsolete  lease cancellation  facility downsizing  and other exit costs 
if actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted 
self insurance reserves 
beginning in  we are partially self insured for certain losses related to employee medical and dental coverage  excluding employees covered by health maintenance organizations 
we generally have an individual stop loss deductible of  per enrollee unless specific exposures are separately insured 
we have accrued a contingent liability of million as of december   which is not discounted  based on an examination of historical trends  our claims experience  industry claims experience  actuarial analysis  and estimates 
the primary estimates used in the development of our accrual at december  include total enrollment including employee contributions  population demographics  and historical claims costs incurred 
these estimates are based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market  which asc refers to as level inputs  reflecting our assessment of the assumptions market participants would use to value these liabilities 
although we do not expect that we will ultimately pay claims significantly different from our estimates  self insurance reserves could be affected if future claims experience differs significantly from our historical trends and assumptions 
as part of this process  we engaged a third party actuarial firm to assist management in its analysis 
all estimates  key assumptions  and forecasts were either provided by or reviewed by us 
while we chose to utilize a third party actuary  the related valuation of our self insurance liability represents the conclusions of management and not the conclusions or statements of any third party 
while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available  if actual trends  including the severity of claims and medical cost inflation  differ from our estimates  our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows could be impacted 
fair value of financial instruments 
we invest our excess cash in deposits with major banks  money market securities  and municipal  us government and sponsored entity  and corporate debt securities 
by policy  we invest primarily in high grade marketable securities 
we are exposed to credit risk in the event of default by the financial institutions or issuers of these investments to the extent of amounts recorded on the consolidated balance sheet 
we consider all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents 
typically  the cost of these investments has approximated fair value 
marketable investments with a maturity greater than three months are classified as available for sale short term investments 
available for sale securities are stated at fair market value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity oci  adjusted for deferred income taxes 
the credit portion of any other than temporary impairment is included in net income loss 
realized gains and losses on sales of financial instruments are recognized upon sale of the investments using the specific identification method 

table of contents asc identifies fair value as the exchange price  or exit price  representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
as a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements  asc establishes a three tier fair value hierarchy as follows level inputs that are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date  level inputs that are other than quoted prices included within level  that are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the measurement date for the duration of the instrument s anticipated life or by comparison to similar instruments  and level inputs that are unobservable or inputs that reflect management s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date 
these include management s own judgments about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances 
we utilize the market approach to measure fair value of our fixed income securities 
the market approach is a valuation technique that uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities 
the fair value of our fixed income securities are obtained using readily available market prices from a variety of industry standard data providers  large financial institutions  and other third party sources for the identical underlying securities 
as part of this process  we engaged pricing services to assist management in its analysis 
all estimates  key assumptions  and forecasts were either provided by or reviewed by us 
while we chose to utilize third party pricing services  the impairment analysis and related valuations represent the conclusions of management and not the conclusions or statements of any third party 
specifically  we obtain the fair value of our level financial instruments from third party asset managers  the custodian bank  and the accounting service providers 
independently  these service providers use professional pricing services to gather pricing data  which may include quoted market prices for identical or comparable instruments or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly 
the service providers then analyze their gathered pricing inputs and apply proprietary valuation techniques  including consensus pricing  weighted average pricing  distribution curve based algorithms  or pricing models such as discounted cash flow techniques to provide a fair value for each security 
the validation procedures performed by management include the following obtaining an understanding of the pricing service s valuation methodologies  including the timing and frequency  evaluating the type  nature  and complexity of our investments in financial instruments  evaluating the activity level in the market for the type of securities in which we have invested including the volatility of price movements requiring analysis  and validating the quoted market prices provided by our service providers by completing a three way reconciliation  comparing the assessment of the fair values provided by the asset manager  the custody bank and the accounting book of record provider for each portfolio 
obtaining an understanding of these valuation risks allows us to respond by developing internal controls that appropriately mitigate any risks identified 
if material discrepancies are noted when comparing the valuations on a security by security basis  then we conduct detailed pricing analysis  search alternative pricing sources  or require the service provider to provide an in depth price analysis prior to recording the fair value in our financial statements 
if we determine that a price provided by the third party pricing services is not reflective of the fair value of the security  we require the custodian bank or accounting service provider to update their price file accordingly 

table of contents at least annually  we review the pricing practices followed by the various entities involved in determining the fair value of our securities  including comparing their process and practices to those followed by other external third party pricing vendors 
also  at least annually  we review the internal controls provided in place at the custodian bank and the accounting service provider 
the fair value of our investments in certain money market funds is expected to maintain a net asset value of per share and  as such  is priced at the expected market price 
we review investments in fixed income debt securities for other than temporary impairment whenever the fair value is less than the amortized cost and evidence indicates the investment s carrying amount is not recoverable within a reasonable period of time 
we assess the fair value of individual securities as part of our ongoing portfolio management 
our other than temporary assessment includes reviewing the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than amortized cost  the seniority and durations of the securities  adverse conditions related to a security  industry  or sector  historical and projected issuer financial performance  credit ratings  issuer specific news  and other available relevant information 
to determine whether an impairment is other than temporary  we consider whether we have the intent to sell the impaired security or if it will be more likely than not that we will be required to sell the impaired security before a market price recovery and whether evidence indicating the cost of the investment is recoverable outweighs evidence to the contrary 
we have determined that gross unrealized losses on short term investments at december  are temporary in nature because each investment meets our investment policy and credit quality requirements 
we have the ability and intent to hold these investments until they recover their unrealized losses  which may not be until maturity 
evidence that we will recover our investments outweighs evidence to the contrary 
in determining whether a credit loss existed  we used our best estimate of the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from each debt security 
for asset backed and mortgage backed securities  cash flow estimates including prepayment assumptions rely on data from widely accepted third party data sources or internal estimates 
in addition to prepayment assumptions  cash flow estimates vary based on assumptions regarding the underlying collateral including default rates  recoveries  and changes in value 
expected cash flows were discounted using the effective interest rate implicit in the securities 
accounting for stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with asc  which requires stock based compensation expense to be recognized based on the fair value of such awards on the date of grant 
we amortize stock based compensation expense on a graded vesting basis over the vesting period  after assessing the probability of achieving the requisite performance criteria with respect to performance based awards 
stock based compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche as though the award were  in substance  multiple awards 
we apply an estimated forfeiture rate based on historical experience and management assessment to reflect what we believe will be our final stock based compensation expense 
we must use our judgment in determining and applying the assumptions needed for the valuation of employee stock options  rsus  rsas  and issuance of common stock under our espp 
we use the black scholes merton bsm option pricing model to value stock based compensation for all equity awards  except market based awards 
market based awards are valued using a monte carlo valuation model 
option pricing models were developed to estimate the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions and are fully transferable 
the bsm model determines the fair value of stock based payment awards based on the stock price on the date of grant and is affected by assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  expected term  interest rates  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behavior 
expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock over a preceding period commensurate with the expected term of the option 
the expected term is based on management s consideration of the historical life  vesting period  and contractual period of the options granted 
the risk free 
table of contents interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
expected dividend yield was not considered in the option pricing formula since we do not pay dividends and have no current plans to do so in the future 
accounting for income taxes 
we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we estimate our actual current tax expense and temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue for tax and book accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income by considering both positive and negative evidence relating to their recoverability 
if we believe that recovery of these deferred tax assets is not more likely than not  we establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent that we increase a valuation allowance in a period  we include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which such determination is made 
significant management judgment is required to determine our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we considered all available evidence  including recent operating results  projections of future taxable income  our ability to utilize loss and credit carryforwards  and the feasibility of tax planning strategies 
a significant piece of objective positive evidence evaluated was cumulative pre tax income over a three year period ended december  in addition  we considered that loss and credit carryforwards have not expired unused and a majority of our loss and credit carryforwards will not expire prior to finally  we have considered that our results from operations have improved each year since as a result of this evaluation  we have determined that it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit related to our deferred tax assets  except for a valuation allowance on foreign tax credits resulting from the acquisition of best gmbh  compensation deductions potentially limited by irc m  and net operating loss carryforwards resulting from the radius acquisition 
the realizability of deferred tax assets could be negatively impacted if sufficient taxable income in the carryforward period is not generated 
current and noncurrent deferred tax assets  net of current and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities  as of december  were million  net of valuation allowance of million 
in accordance with asc through  income taxes basic recognition threshold  we account for uncertainty in income taxes by recognizing a tax position only when it is more likely than not that the tax position  based on its technical merits  will be sustained upon ultimate settlement with the applicable tax authority 
the tax benefit to be recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the applicable tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
significant management judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions 
our gross unrecognized benefits are million as of december  our evaluation of uncertain tax positions is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
if actual settlements differ from these estimates  or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to recognize additional tax benefits or charges that could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
as of december   we have permanently reinvested million of unremitted earnings 
should these earnings be remitted to the us  the tax on these earnings would be million 
valuation analyses of goodwill and intangible assets 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of each year according to the provisions of asc a two step impairment test of 
table of contents goodwill is required 
in the first step  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
if the fair value exceeds carrying value  goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not required 
if the carrying value exceeds fair value  then the second step of the impairment test is required to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the reporting unit  excluding goodwill  from the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in the first step 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then an impairment loss must be recorded equal to the difference 
our goodwill valuation analysis is based on our respective reporting units fiery  inkjet  and apps  which are consistent with our operating segments identified in note segment information  geographic data  and major customers of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we determined the fair value of our reporting units as of december  by equally weighting the market and income approaches 
under the market approach  we estimated fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings of comparable companies 
under the income approach  we estimated fair value based on a projected cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
based on our valuation results  we have determined that the fair values of our reporting units exceed their carrying values 
fiery  inkjet  and apps fair values are   and million  respectively  which exceed carrying value by   and  respectively 
to identify suitable comparable companies under the market approach  consideration was given to the financial condition and operating performance of the reporting unit being evaluated relative to companies operating in the same or similar businesses  potentially subject to corresponding economic  environmental  and political factors and considered to be reasonable investment alternatives 
consideration was given to the investment characteristics of the subject company relative to those of similar publicly traded companies ie  guideline companies  which are actively traded 
in applying the pcmmm  valuation multiples were derived from historical and projected operating data of guideline companies and applied to the appropriate operating data of our reporting units to arrive at an indication of fair value 
five  four  and seven suitable guideline companies were identified for the fiery  inkjet  and apps reporting units  respectively 
while the fair value of the fiery  inkjet and apps reporting units exceeded their carrying value as of december  as indicated by the market based valuation  management determined to further examine whether an impairment had occurred given the inkjet impairment recognized in the fourth quarter of and the susceptibility of the apps reporting unit to fair value fluctuations 
we reviewed the factors that could trigger an impairment charge and completed an income based impairment analysis for all three reporting units 
as part of this process  we engaged a third party valuation firm to assist management in its analysis 
all estimates  key assumptions  and forecasts were either provided by or reviewed by us 
while we chose to utilize a third party valuation firm  the impairment analysis and related valuations represent the conclusions of management and not the conclusions or statements of any third party 
solely for purposes of establishing inputs for the income approach to assess the fair value of the fiery  inkjet  and apps reporting units  we made the following assumptions fiery and inkjet revenue approximated historical normalized growth rates in during  apps revenue growth of exceeded historical normalized growth rates due to several acquisitions completed in and despite the ongoing economic uncertainty  our reporting units revenue will grow at historical normalized rates between and for the following primary reasons the ongoing transition from analog to digital technology will enable our fiery revenue to grow at historical normalized rates in spite of the economic climate 
this transition is expected to continue through the forecast horizon 
fiery is also well positioned to achieve historical normalized growth rates due to our software solutions  including our self service and payment solution entrac 

table of contents as the leading world wide manufacturer of digital uv ink  our inkjet revenue is positioned to outpace the slow economy and achieve historical normalized growth rates due to the ongoing transition from solvent based to uv curable based printing and from uv curing to uv led curing 
this transition is expected to continue through the forecast horizon 
our acquisition strategy in the apps reporting unit will enable us to achieve historical normalized revenue growth rates through the forecast horizon 
our intention is to continue to explore additional acquisition opportunities in the apps operating segment to further consolidate the business process automation and cloud based order entry and order management software industries in both the americas and world wide 
long term industry growth after with the exception of fiery  which is conservatively assumed at long term growth rates by gross profit percentages will approximate historical average levels in the fiery and apps reporting units 
inkjet gross profit will remain at the percent level  which is the approximate level achieved in as we have resolved significant warranty issues and exposures 
our discounted cash flow projections were based on five year financial forecasts  which were based on annual financial forecasts developed internally by management for use in managing our business and through discussions with the valuation firm engaged by us 
the significant assumptions utilized in these five year financial forecasts included consolidated annual revenue growth rates ranging from to  which equates to a consolidated compound annual growth rate of 
these are our historical normalized growth rates 
future cash flows were discounted to present value using a mid year convention and a consolidated discount rate of 
terminal values were calculated using the gordon growth methodology with a consolidated long term growth rate of 
the sum of the fair values of the fiery  inkjet  and apps reporting units was reconciled to our current market capitalization based on our stock price plus an estimated control premium 
significant assumptions used in determining fair values of the reporting units under the market based and income based analyses include the determination of appropriate market comparables  estimated multiples of revenue and ebit that a willing buyer is likely to pay  estimated control premium a willing buyer is likely to pay  gross profit  and operating expenses 
gross profit and operating expenses as a percentage of revenue over the five year forecast horizon were compared to approximate percentages realized by the guideline companies 
to assess the reasonableness of the estimated control premium of  we examined the most similar transactions in relevant industries and determined the average premium indicated by the transactions deemed to be most similar to a hypothetical transaction involving our reporting units 
we examined the weighted average and median control premiums offered in relevant industries  industry specific control premiums  and specific transaction control premiums to conclude that our estimated control premium is reasonable 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable or the life of the asset may need to be revised 
factors considered important that could trigger an impairment review include significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  our market capitalization relative to net book value  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets  significant changes in the strategy for our overall business  and our assessment of growth and profitability in each reporting unit over the coming years 
given the uncertainty of the economic environment and the potential impact on our business  there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions regarding the duration of the ongoing economic downturn  or the 
table of contents period or strength of recovery  made for purposes of our goodwill impairment testing at december  will prove to be accurate predictions of the future 
if our assumptions regarding forecasted revenue or gross profit rates are not achieved  we may be required to record additional goodwill impairment charges in future periods relating to any of our reporting units  whether in connection with the next annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of or prior to that  if any such change constitutes an interim triggering event 
it is not possible to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or  if it does  whether such charge would be material 
business combinations 
we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired  including ipr d  and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
such a valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
the results of operations for each acquisition are included in our financial statements from the date of acquisition 
effective in  asc was amended 
the fundamental requirement that the acquisition method of accounting be used for all business combinations was retained while revising the accounting treatment for the fair values of certain acquired assets  liabilities  and expenses 
see note the company and its significant accounting policies of our notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of the impact of this accounting pronouncement on our accounting for business combinations 
management estimates fair value based on assumptions believed to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies 
critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include  but are not limited to future expected cash flows  acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop ipr d into commercially viable products and estimating cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s brand awareness and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  and discount rates 
we estimate the fair value of acquisition related contingent consideration based on the probability of realization of the performance targets 
this estimate is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market  which asc refers to as level inputs  reflecting our assessment of the assumptions market participants would use to value these liabilities 
the fair value of contingent consideration is remeasured at each reporting period  with any changes in the fair value recognized as a component of general and administrative expense 
other estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions include severance costs and the costs to vacate or downsize facilities  including the future costs to operate and eventually abandon or relinquish duplicate facilities 
these costs are recognized as restructuring and other expenses and are based on management estimates and are subject to refinement 
estimated costs may change as additional information becomes available regarding assets acquired and liabilities assumed and as management continues its assessment of the pre merger operations 
acquisition related costs of and million were expensed during the years ended december  and  respectively  associated with businesses acquired during the periods reported and cretaprint  which was acquired subsequent to year end

non cash charges and credits consist primarily of million in depreciation and amortization  million of stock based compensation expense  provision for inventory obsolescence of million  and provision for allowance for bad debts and sales related allowances of million  partially offset by million deferred tax credit and 
table of contents million of other non cash credits  charges  and provisions 
the net change in operating assets and liabilities of million consists primarily of increases in inventories  accounts receivable  and other current assets of   and million  respectively  offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million and net taxes payable of million 
accounts receivable our primary source of operating cash flow is the collection of accounts receivable from our customers 
one measure of the effectiveness of our collection efforts is average days sales outstanding for accounts receivable dso 
dsos were   and days at december    and  respectively 
we calculate dso by dividing net accounts receivable at the end of the quarter by revenue recognized during the quarter  multiplied by the total days in the quarter 
dso improved in due to strong collections 
we expect dsos to vary from period to period because of changes in the mix of business between our direct customers and end user demand driven through the leading printer manufacturers  the effectiveness of our collection efforts both domestically and overseas  and variations in the linearity of our sales 
as the percentage of inkjet and apps related revenue increases  we expect dsos may trend higher 
our dsos related to the inkjet and apps operating segments are traditionally higher than those related to the significant printer manufacturer customers distributors in our fiery operating segment as  historically  they have paid on a more timely basis 
inventories our inventories are procured primarily in support of the inkjet and fiery operating segments 
our inventories decreased by million from million in to million in primarily due to improved inventory management and increased shipments during the fourth quarter 
inventory turnover improved from turns in to turns in we calculate inventory turnover by dividing annualized fourth quarter cost of revenue by average inventories 
accounts payable  accrued and other liabilities  and net income taxes payable our operating cash flows are impacted by the timing of payments to our vendors for accounts payable and by our accrual of liabilities 
the change in accounts payable  accrued and other liabilities  and net income taxes payable increased our cash flows provided by operating activities by and million in and  respectively  and increased our cash flows used for operating activities by million in our working capital  defined as current assets minus current liabilities  was and million at december  and  respectively

earnout payments were made relating to previously accrued radius liabilities of million during the year ended december  the first earnout period ended december  with consideration earned of approximately million 
the final earnout period ended december  with consideration earned of approximately million 
the portion of the radius earnout representing performance targets achieved in excess of the fair value recognized in the opening balance sheet were and million for the years ended decmeber  and  respectively 
these adjustments to the radius earnout were recognized as general and administrative expenses and are reflected as cash used for operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
earnout payments were made relating to previously accrued pace liabilities of and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
on july   we purchased pace for approximately million  net of cash acquired  including direct acquisition costs  plus an additional cash earnout  which was contingent on achieving certain performance targets 
the first earnout period ended december  with consideration earned of approximately million 
the second earnout period ended december  with consideration earned of approximately million 
the final earnout period ended december  with consideration earned of million  resulting in cumulative additional cash earnouts of million  which have been accounted for as an adjustment to the purchase price in accordance with the accounting requirements for business combinations that closed prior to property and equipment our net property and equipment purchases totaled   and million in   and  respectively 
our property and equipment additions have been funded by cash from operations 

table of contents we anticipate that we will continue to purchase property and equipment in the normal course of our business 
the amount and timing of these purchases and the related cash outflows in future periods are difficult to predict and are dependent on a number of factors including our hiring of employees  the rate of change in computer hardware and software used in our business  our business outlook  and decisions to further invest or expand business sites 
during the first quarter of  we sold a portion of the foster city  california  campus for million 
under the agreement  we sold the approximately  square foot building at velocity way  as well as approximately acres of related land and certain other assets related to the property 
net proceeds from the sale of building and land  net of direct transaction costs paid in  were million 
the cost of the land  building  improvements  and direct transaction costs were included in the determination of the million gain on sale of building and land 
investments during  we received net proceeds from sale and maturities of our marketable securities of million 
during and  we purchased  net of sales and maturities  marketable securities of and million  respectively 
we have classified our investment portfolio as available for sale 
our investments are made with a policy of capital preservation and liquidity as primary objectives 
we may hold investments in corporate bonds and us government agency securities to maturity  however  we may sell an investment at any time if the quality rating of the investment declines  the yield on the investment is no longer attractive  or we have better uses for the cash 
since we invest primarily in investment securities that are highly liquid with a ready market  we believe the purchase  maturity  or sale of our investments has no material impact on our overall liquidity 
other investments  included within other assets  consist of equity and debt investments in privately held companies that develop products  markets  and services that are considered to be strategic to us 
each of these investments had been fully impaired in prior years 
on september   we received the proceeds from the sale of one of these investments of million 
restricted cash and investments we have restricted investments that are required to be maintained by the synthetic lease of our foster city office facility 
we are required to maintain cash in libor based interest bearing accounts  which fully collateralize our synthetic lease 
we had million of restricted investments at december   which was accounted for as restricted investments within noncurrent assets 
we are also required to maintain restricted cash of million related to a customer agreement that was obtained through the alphagraph acquisition 
the current portion of million represents the restriction that will be released in and is included in other current assets 
the noncurrent portion of million is included in other assets 
financing activities historically  our recurring cash flows provided by financing activities have been from the receipt of cash from the issuance of common stock through the exercise of stock options and for espp shares 
we received proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee purchases of espp shares of   and million in   and  respectively 
while we may continue to receive proceeds from these plans in future periods  the timing and amount of such proceeds are difficult to predict and are contingent on a number of factors including the price of our common stock  the number of employees participating in the plans  and general market conditions 
we anticipate that cash provided from the exercise of stock options may decline over time as we shift to issuance of rsus  rather than stock options 

table of contents the primary use of funds for financing activities in   and was   and million  respectively  of cash used to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock 
in february  our board of directors authorized a million repurchase of our outstanding common stock 
in august  our board of directors authorized an additional million repurchase of our outstanding common stock  which is currently in progress 
common stock repurchases in included the million asr  million tender offer  and repurchase of stock options from certain employees in conjunction with our fair value stock option exchange 
common stock repurchases includes cash used for net settlement of rsus and rsas for employee common stock related tax liabilities in   and on february   we entered into an agreement with ubs ag  london branch ubs  to repurchase million of our outstanding common stock under the asr program 
in march  million shares were delivered by ubs representing the minimum number of shares to be delivered under the asr agreement 
upon the discretion of ubs  the asr concluded in august with the delivery of thousand shares 
we are not obligated to issue or transfer any shares to ubs or make any payment to ubs beyond the million payment made in the first quarter of transaction costs of million were incurred under the asr 
in october  our board of directors approved the repurchase of million of our common stock through the use of a modified dutch auction tender offer by utilizing the balance of the previously authorized million share repurchase program 
the tender offer closed on december  resulting in the repurchase of million shares at a cost of million  which included million of direct transaction costs 
all shares received from the asr and the tender offer were recorded as additional treasury stock accounted for under the cost method  thereby reducing shares outstanding 
our buyback program is limited by sec regulations and by compliance with our insider trading policy 
see item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters  and issuer purchases of equity securities for further discussion of our common stock repurchase programs 
the synthetic lease agreement for our corporate headquarters provides a residual value guarantee 
under asc  guarantees  the fair value of a residual value guarantee in lease agreements must be recognized as a liability in our consolidated balance sheet 
we have determined that the guarantee has no material value as of december  other commitments our fiery inventory consists primarily of raw and finished goods  memory subsystems  processors  and asics  which are sold to third party contract manufacturers responsible for manufacturing our products 
our inkjet inventories consist of raw and finished goods  print heads  frames  digital uv ink  and other components in support of our internal manufacturing operations and solvent ink  which is purchased from third party contract manufacturers responsible for manufacturing our solvent ink 
should we decide to purchase components and do our own manufacturing of fiery controllers  or should it become necessary for us to purchase and sell components other than processors  asics  or memory subsystems to our contract manufacturers  inventory balances and potentially property and equipment would increase significantly  thereby reducing our available cash resources 
further  the inventories we carry could become obsolete  thereby negatively impacting our financial condition and results of operations 
we are also reliant on several sole source suppliers for certain key components and could experience a further significant negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations if such supplies were reduced or not available 
we may be required to compensate our subcontract manufacturers for components purchased for orders subsequently cancelled by us 
we periodically review the potential liability and the adequacy of the related allowance 
our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted if we were required to compensate our subcontract manufacturers in amounts in excess of the related allowance

contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
this table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as liabilities at december   with the exception of acquisition related contingent liabilities 
payments due by period in thousands total less than year between years between years more than years operating lease obligations contingent liability purchase obligations total lease obligations related to the principal corporate facilities are estimated based on current market interest rates libor

represents the fair value of acquisition related contingent consideration 
the current fair value is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets under the caption accrued and other liabilities and represents the portion earned based on realization of performance targets 
the noncurrent fair value is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets under the caption contingent and other liabilities and represents the present value of the contingent liabilities expected to be earned in subsequent years based on discounted probability adjusted revenue 
excludes contractual obligations recorded on the balance sheet as current liabilities and certain purchase orders as discussed below 
purchase obligations in the table above include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable  non cancellable  and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum  or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations exclude purchase orders for raw materials and other goods and services that are cancelable without penalty 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are generally fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however  the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
the expected timing of payment for the obligations listed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on when the goods or services are received or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
the above table does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of million  the timing of which is uncertain 
see note income taxes of notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of unrecognized tax benefits 

table of contents off balance sheet financing synthetic lease arrangements as of december   we were a party to a synthetic lease lease covering our facility located at velocity way  foster city  california 
the lease provides a cost effective means of providing adequate office space for our corporate offices 
the lease is scheduled to expire in july the lease includes an option to purchase the facility for the amount expended by the lessor to purchase the facility 
we guaranteed to the lessor a residual value associated with the building equal to of their funding of the lease 
under the financial covenants  we must maintain a minimum net worth and a minimum tangible net worth as of the end of each quarter 
there is an additional covenant regarding mergers 
we are liable to the lessor for the financed amount of the building if we default on our covenants 
we were in compliance with all such financial and merger related covenants as of december  we have assessed our exposure in relation to the first loss guarantees under the lease and have determined there is no deficiency to the guaranteed value at december  if there is a decline in value  we will record a loss associated with the residual value guarantee 
the million pledged under the lease is in libor based interest bearing accounts as of december  and is restricted as to withdrawal at all times 
as of december   we are treated as the owner of this building for federal income tax purposes 
in conjunction with the lease  we leased the land on which the building is located to the lessor of the building 
this separate ground lease is for approximately years 
the lease is scheduled to expire in item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion of our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
market risk we are exposed to various market risks 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  general credit  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation  liquidity  and interest rate risks  which may be exacerbated by the tightening of the global credit market and increase in economic uncertainty that have affected various sectors of the financial market and continue to cause credit and liquidity issues 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we may enter into financial instrument contracts to manage and reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings and cash flows 
the counterparties to such contracts are major financial institutions 
we hedge our operating expense exposure in indian rupees 
the notional amount of our indian rupee cash flow hedge was million at december  as of december   we had not entered into hedges against any other currency exposures  but we may consider hedging against movements in other currencies as well as adjusting the hedged portion of our indian rupee exposure in the future 
see financial risk management below for a discussion of european market risk 
interest rate risk marketable securities we maintain an investment portfolio of short term fixed income debt securities of various holdings  types  and maturities 
these short term investments are generally classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of oci 
we attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by investing in securities with maturities of less than three years  however  we may be unable to successfully limit our risk to interest rate fluctuations 
at any time  a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
conversely  declines in interest rates could have a material impact on interest earnings for our portfolio 
we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures 

table of contents the following table presents the hypothetical change in fair values in the financial instruments held by us at december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the modeling technique measures the change in fair value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates 
market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points over a twelve month time horizon in thousands valuation of securities given an interest rate decrease of basis points no change in interest rates valuation of securities given an interest rate increase of basis points foreign currency exchange risk a large portion of our business is conducted in countries other than the us we are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates for the euro  british pound sterling  indian rupee  japanese yen  and australian dollar 
although the majority of our receivables are invoiced and collected in us dollars  we have exposure from us dollar denominated sales consisting of the euro  british pound sterling  japanese yen  australian dollar  and new zealand dollar and operating expenses primarily the euro  british pound sterling  japanese yen  indian rupee  and australian dollar in foreign countries 
we can benefit from a weaker dollar and we can be adversely affected from a stronger dollar relative to major currencies world wide 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates  and in particular a weakening of the us dollar  may adversely affect our consolidated operating expenses and operating income loss as expressed in us dollars 
we hedge our operating expense exposure in indian rupees 
the notional amount of our indian rupee cash flow hedge was million at december  as of december   we had not entered into hedges against any other currency exposures  but we may consider hedging against movements in other currencies as well as adjusting the hedged portion of our indian rupee exposure in the future 
financial risk management as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
our exposures are related to non us dollar denominated sales in europe  japan  the uk  australia  and new zealand and are primarily related to operating expenses in europe  india  japan  the uk  and australia 
we hedge our operating expense exposure in indian rupees 
as of december   we had not entered into hedges against any other currency exposures  but we may consider hedging against movements in other currencies as well as adjusting the hedged portion of our indian rupee exposure in the future 
we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types  and maturities  typically us treasury and government sponsored entity securities  corporate debt instruments  and mortgage backed instruments 
these short term investments are classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of oci 
these securities are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading 
sec division of corporation finance disclosure guidance topic guidance topic  european sovereign debt  encourages registrants to discuss their exposure to the recent intensification of uncertainty in the european economy 
specifically  registrants are asked to disclose their european debt by counterparty ie  sovereign and non sovereign and by country 
we have no european sovereign debt investments 
our european debt investments consist of non sovereign corporate debt included within money market funds of million  which represents of our money market funds at december  our european debt investments are with corporations domiciled in the northern or central european countries of sweden  germany  netherlands  switzerland  norway  france  and the uk we have no exposure in southern europe where the greater risk 
table of contents resides 
accordingly  we believe that we do not have significant exposure with respect to our corporate debt investments in europe and such investments  which are included within money market funds  meet the definition of cash equivalents at december  since europe represents a significant portion of our revenue and cash flow  guidance topic encourages disclosure of our european concentrations of credit risk regarding gross receivables  related reserves  and aging on a region or country basis  and the impact on liquidity with respect to estimated timing of receivable payments 
since europe is composed of varied countries and regional economies  our european risk profile is somewhat more diversified due to the varying economic conditions among the countries 
approximately of our receivables are with european customers 
of this amount  of our european receivables of consolidated net receivables are in the higher risk southern european countries mostly italy and spain  which are not considered to be material to consolidated net receivables and are adequately reserved
