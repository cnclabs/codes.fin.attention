introduction the pep boys manny  moe jack is the leading national chain offering automotive service  tires  parts and accessories 
this positioning allows us to streamline the distribution channel and pass the savings on to our customers facilitating our vision to be the automotive solutions provider of choice for the value oriented customer 
the majority of our stores are in a supercenter format  which serves both do it for me difm  which includes service labor  installed merchandise and tires and do it yourself diy customers with the highest quality service offerings and merchandise 
most of our supercenters also have a commercial sales program that provides delivery of tires  parts and other products to automotive repair shops and dealers 
in  as part of our long term strategy to lead with automotive service  we began complementing our existing supercenter store base with service tire centers 
these service tire centers are designed to capture market share and leverage our existing supercenter and support infrastructure 
this growth will occur both organically and through acquisitions 
the growth is targeted at existing markets  but may include new markets opportunistically 
acquisitions will be used to accelerate growth in markets where the company is under penetrated 
during fiscal  we acquired service tire centers see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data  opened new service tire centers and one new supercenter  converted one pep express retail only store and one service tire center to supercenters  and closed three stores 
we are targeting a total of new service tire centers and supercenters in fiscal as of january   we operated supercenters and service tire centers  as well as seven legacy pep express stores throughout states and puerto rico 
executive summary net earnings for fiscal were million  a million decrease from the million reported for fiscal the decrease in profitability was primarily due to lower total gross profit margins  higher selling  general and administrative expenses  and lower net gains from disposition of assets 
the current year net earnings also benefitted from a reduction in the effective tax rate which declined from in fiscal year to in the current year 
our diluted earnings per share for fiscal were  a decrease of from the recorded for fiscal total revenue increased for fiscal by as compared to fiscal as a result of our growth strategy 
this increase in total revenues was comprised of a increase in service revenue and a increase in merchandise sales 
for fiscal  comparable store sales sales generated by 
table of contents locations in operation during the same period of the prior year decreased by 
this decrease in comparable store sales was comprised of a increase in comparable store service revenue offset by a decrease in comparable store merchandise sales 
sales of our services and non discretionary products are impacted by miles driven 
from march through december  unleaded gasoline prices averaged per gallon national average as compared to in the corresponding period of the prior year 
we believe the significant increase in gasoline prices led to the decrease in miles driven from march through november  after growing moderately over the previous months 
this change in trend combined with the financial burden of higher gasoline prices  continued high unemployment and negative consumer confidence in the overall us economy depressed our fiscal sales 
we believe these factors have also led customers to maintain their existing vehicles  rather than purchasing new ones which  in turn has partially offset the negative impact the reduction in miles driven has had on our sales of services and non discretionary products 
these same factors have negatively affected sales in our discretionary product categories like accessories and complementary merchandise 
given the nature of these macroeconomic factors  we cannot predict whether or for how long these trends will continue  nor can we predict to what degree these trends will affect us in the future 
in addition  an unseasonably warm winter quarter in fiscal reduced sales in certain categories including wiper blades  batteries  antifreeze and winter goods 
our primary response to fluctuations in customer demand is to adjust our service and product assortment  store staffing and advertising messages 
we believe that we are well positioned to help our customers save money and meet their needs in a challenging macroeconomic environment 
in  we have continued our surround sound media campaign that utilizes television  radio  digital and direct mail advertising to communicate our does everything 
for less 
brand message and have focused on execution excellence in our stores in order to earn the trust of our customers every day 
we continue to develop innovative ways to make it more convenient for customers to do business with us and in the third quarter of we launched treadsmart  which gives customers the ability to research  purchase and schedule the installation of tires online at a local pep boys location 
we are currently piloting  and expect to roll out nationally in  ecommerce solutions that will allow retail customers to purchase products online for pick up at their local store or delivery to their home and commercial customers to order  pay and manage their accounts online

non comparable stores contributed an additional million of total revenue in fiscal as compared to the prior year

the decrease in comparable store merchandise sales was comprised of a decline in our retail business which was mostly offset by a increase in merchandise sold through our service business as a result of increased tire and installed part sales 
total service revenue increased  or million  to million in fiscal from million in the prior year 
the increase in service revenue was comprised of a million  or  increase in comparable store service revenue and million of service revenue from our new non comparable stores 
we believe that comparable store customer counts decreased due to macroeconomic conditions  while the average transaction amount per customer increased due to selling price increases implemented to reflect the inflation in product acquisition costs 
we believe the significant increase in gasoline prices led to a decline in miles driven  which combined with the financial burden of higher gasoline prices  continued high unemployment and negative consumer confidence in the overall us economy depressed our fiscal sales 
these negative economic conditions were somewhat mitigated by the continued aging of the us light vehicle fleet as consumers spent more money on maintaining their vehicles as opposed to buying new vehicles 
over the long term  we believe utilizing innovative marketing programs to communicate our value priced  differentiated service and merchandise assortment will drive increased customer counts and our continued focus on delivering a better customer experience than our competitors will convert those increased customer counts into sales improvements consistently over all lines of business

generally  specialized automotive retailers focus on either the service or retail area of the business 
we believe that 
table of contents operation in both the service and retail areas positively differentiates us from most of our competitors 
although we manage our performance at a store level in aggregation  we believe that the following presentation  which includes the reclassification of revenue from merchandise that we install in customer vehicles to service center revenue  shows an accurate comparison against competitors within the two sales arenas

the termination of the plan is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal in order to terminate the plan  in accordance with internal revenue service and pension benefit guaranty corporation requirements  the company is required to fully fund the plan on a termination basis and will commit to contribute the additional assets necessary to do so 
plan participants will not be adversely affected by the plan termination  but rather will have their benefits either converted into a lump sum cash payment or an annuity contract placed with an insurance carrier 

table of contents the expense under these plans for fiscal  and was million  million and million  respectively 
pension expense for the plan is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  including an expected return on plan assets of and a discount rate of 
in developing the expected return on asset assumptions  we evaluated input from our actuaries  including their review of asset class return expectations 
the discount rate utilized for the plan is based on a model bond portfolio with durations that match the expected benefit payment pattern 
we continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions and make adjustments as necessary for the existing plans 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data for further discussion of our pension plans 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to customer incentives  product returns and warranty obligations  bad debts  inventories  income taxes  financing operations  retirement benefits  share based compensation  risk participation agreements  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following represent our more critical estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements inventory is stated at lower of cost  as determined under the last in  first out lifo method  or market 
our inventory  consists primarily of automotive parts and accessories  is used on vehicles 
because of the relatively long lives of vehicles  along with our historical experience of returning most excess inventory to our vendors for full credit  the risk of obsolescence is minimal 
we establish a reserve for excess inventory for instances where less than full credit will be received for such returns and where we anticipate items will be sold at retail prices that are less than recorded costs 
the reserve is based on management s judgment  including estimates and assumptions regarding marketability of products  the market value of inventory to be sold in future periods and on historical experiences where we received less than full credit from vendors for product returns 
if our estimates regarding excess inventory are inaccurate  we may incur losses or gains that could be material 
a difference in our inventory reserves as of january  would have affected net income by approximately million in fiscal we record reserves for future sales returns  customer incentives  warranty claims and inventory shrinkage 
the reserves are based on expected returns of products and historical claims and inventory shrinkage experience 
if actual experience differs from historical levels  revisions in our estimates may be required 
a change in these reserves at january  would have affected net earnings by approximately million for fiscal we have risk participation arrangements with respect to workers compensation  general liability  automobile liability  other casualty coverages and health care insurance  including stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit our total exposure 
a reserve for the liabilities associated with these agreements is established using generally accepted actuarial methods 
table of contents followed in the insurance industry and our historical claims experience 
the amounts included in our costs related to these arrangements are estimated and can vary based on changes in assumptions  claims experience or the providers included in the associated insurance programs 
a change in our self insurance liabilities at january  would have affected net earnings by approximately million for fiscal we have significant pension costs and liabilities that are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates  expected return on plan assets and mortality rates 
we are required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in selecting these assumptions 
changes in the related pension costs or liabilities may occur in the future due to changes in the assumptions 
the following table highlights the sensitivity of our pension obligation and expense to changes in these assumptions  assuming all other assumptions remain constant change in assumption dollars in thousands impact on annual pension expense impact on projected benefit obligation percentage point decrease in discount rate increase increase  percentage point increase in discount rate decrease decrease  percentage point decrease in expected rate of return on assets increase percentage point increase in expected rate of return on assets decrease we periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment 
management s judgments  including judgments related to store cash flows  are based on market and operating conditions at the time of evaluation 
future events could cause management s conclusion on impairment to change  requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value 
we have a share based compensation plan  which includes stock options and restricted stock units  or rsus 
we account for our share based compensation plans on a fair value basis 
we determine the fair value of our stock options at the date of the grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the rsus are awarded at a price equal to the market price of our underlying stock on the date of the grant 
in situations where we have granted stock options and rsus with market conditions  we have used monte carlo simulations in estimating the fair value of the award 
the pricing model and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards 
these assumptions and judgments include the expected life of stock options  expected stock price volatility  future employee stock option exercise behaviors and the estimate of award forfeitures 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine stock based compensation expense 
however  if actual results are different from these assumptions  the share based compensation expense reported in our financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the share based compensation 
in addition  significant changes in these assumptions could materially impact our share based compensation expense on future awards 
a change in our share based compensation expense for fiscal would have affected net earnings by approximately million 
we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation of property and equipment and valuation of inventories  for tax and accounting purposes 
we determine our provision for income taxes based on federal and state tax laws and regulations currently in 
table of contents effect 
legislation changes currently proposed by certain states in which we operate  if enacted  could increase our transactions or activities subject to tax 
any such legislation that becomes law could result in an increase in our state income tax expense and our state income taxes paid  which could have a material effect on our net earnings 
at any one time our tax returns for many tax years are subject to examination by us federal  commonwealth  and state taxing jurisdictions 
for income tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions to be recognized  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized in the financial statements unless it is more likely than not to be sustained 
we adjust these tax liabilities  as well as the related interest and penalties  based on the latest facts and circumstances  including recently published rulings  court cases  and outcomes of tax audits 
to the extent our actual tax liability differs from our established tax liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits  our effective tax rate may be materially impacted 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome of  the timing of  or the tax treatment of any particular tax position or deduction  we believe that our tax balances reflect the more likely than not outcome of known tax contingencies 
the temporary differences between the book and tax treatment of income and expenses result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not more likely than not  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a future period  income tax expense will be impacted 
actual results could differ from this assessment if adequate taxable income is not generated in future periods from either operations or projected tax planning strategies 
recent accounting standards in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu fair value measurements improving disclosures on fair value measurements asu 
this guidance requires new disclosures surrounding transfers in and out of level or in the fair value hierarchy and also requires that the reconciliation of level inputs includes separately reported information on purchases  sales  issuances and settlements 
the increased disclosures should be reported for each class of assets or liabilities 
asu also clarifies existing disclosures for the level of disaggregating  disclosures about valuation techniques and inputs used to determine level or fair value measurements and includes conforming amendments to the guidance on employers disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets 
asu was effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances or settlements in the roll forward activity for level fair value measurements which are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued asu business combinations topic disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations asu 
this accounting standard update clarifies that sec registrants presenting comparative financial statements should disclose in their pro forma information revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the current period business combinations had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
the update also expands the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and 
table of contents earnings 
asu is effective prospectively for material either on an individual or aggregate basis business combinations entered into in fiscal years beginning on or after december  with early adoption permitted 
the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss asu  which is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december  this guidance amends certain accounting and disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements 
the company does not believe the adoption of asu will have a material impact on the consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in june of  the fasb issued asu no 
 presentation of comprehensive income asu 
asu was issued to improve the comparability of financial reporting between us gaap and international financial reporting standards  and eliminates previous us gaap guidance that allowed an entity to present components of other comprehensive income oci as part of its statement of changes in shareholders equity 
with the issuance of asu  companies are now required to report all components of oci either in a single continuous statement of total comprehensive income  which includes components of both oci and net income  or in a separate statement appearing consecutively with the statement of income 
asu does not affect current guidance for the accounting of the components of oci  or which items are included within total comprehensive income  and is effective for periods beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
on december   the fasb issued asu  which indefinitely defers the provision in asu that required entities to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statements in which net income is presented and the statement in which oci is presented 
the other provisions in asu are unaffected by the deferral 
the application of this guidance affects presentation only and therefore is not expected to have an impact on the company s consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment asu 
the new guidance provides entities with the option to perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before applying the quantitative two step goodwill impairment test 
if an entity concludes that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  it would not be required to perform the quantitative two step goodwill impairment test 
entities also have the option to bypass the assessment of qualitative factors for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the first step of the quantitative two step goodwill impairment test  as was required prior to the issuance of this new guidance 
the new guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
the company does not believe the adoption of asu will have a material impact on the consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has market rate exposure in its financial instruments due to changes in interest rates and prices

at january   there were no 
table of contents outstanding borrowings under the agreement 
additionally  the company has a senior secured term loan facility with a balance of million at january   that bears interest at three month libor plus 
excluding our interest rate swap  a one percent change in the libor rate would have affected net earnings by approximately million for fiscal the risk related to changes in the three month libor rate are substantially mitigated by our interest rate swap 
the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt instruments  principally the senior subordinated notes due december   was million and million at january  and january   respectively 
the company determines fair value on its fixed rate debt by using quoted market prices and current interest rates 
interest rate swaps the company entered into an interest rate swap for a notional amount of million that is designated as a cash flow hedge on the first million of the company s senior secured term loan facility 
the interest rate swap converts the variable libor portion of the interest payments to a fixed rate of and terminates in october as of january  and january   the fair value of the swap was a net million and million payable  respectively  recorded within other long term liabilities on the balance sheet
