the dodd frank act  became law on july  and will effect significant changes to the us financial system 
much of this new law is subject to rulemaking by various agencies  including the federal reserve board  the fdic and the sec 
as these agencies adopt the requisite regulations  the law is progressively being implemented 
among other things  the dodd frank act created a financial stability oversight council to monitor the financial markets in order to identify systemic risks throughout the financial system  promote market discipline and respond promptly to any emerging market threats 
created the bureau of consumer financial protection to ensure compliance with federal consumer protection laws and to adopt rules against unfair  deceptive or abusive practices in the consumer financial services industry 
this is an independent bureau within the federal reserve system with broad authority 
the bureau will consolidate consumer protection powers from other federal agencies  including the fdic and the frb  current federal regulators of the bank and company  respectively 
the rulemaking and enforcement authority of the bureau took effect on july  the bureau has primary rulemaking and enforcement authority with regard to consumer financial protection laws over depository institutions with more than billion in assets 
this authority is secondary with respect to depository institutions  such as the bank  with assets of less than billion 
the fdic will retain primary rulemaking and enforcement authority over the bank in the area of consumer financial protection even though the bureau will have authority to require reports from and to conduct limited examinations of the bank 
requires the fdic to increase the deposit insurance fund dif reserve ratio to by  with offsets for the effect on banks  such as metro  that have less than billion in assets 
changed the calculation of each bank s fdic insurance assessment to base the assessment on the difference between average assets and average tangible equity instead of deposits  effective april  made permanent the federal deposit insurance limit of  which was instituted at the height of the us financial crisis 
unlimited federal deposit insurance is provided until january  for noninterest bearing accounts 
permits interest bearing demand deposit accounts for businesses 
provides for enhanced supervision of the company and permits direct examination of the bank a non member bank by the federal reserve board 
increases the restrictions on interstate bank acquisitions and the purchase of assets from insiders 
contains provisions requiring minimum capital levels for bank holding companies that are the same as those required for insured depository institutions  with exceptions for bank holding companies with less than billion in assets as of december  the exceptions will permit the company s existing trust preferred securities to continue to be treated as tier capital 
requires federal regulators  including the fdic and sec  to issue rules prohibiting depository institutions  depository institution holding companies and other financial institutions  as the federal regulators deem appropriate  from providing i executive officers  employees  directors or principal shareholders with excessive compensation  fees  or benefits  or ii compensation that could lead to a material financial loss to the covered financial institution 
federal regulators have jointly proposed rules to implement these prohibitions but no final rules have been adopted 
implemented several corporate governance requirements applicable to publicly traded companies  including i non binding  advisory shareholder votes on executive compensation and the frequency at which shareholders will vote on such compensation  ii a separate non binding  advisory shareholder vote on compensation payments golden parachutes to executives when a company seeks shareholder approval of an acquisition  merger  or proposed sale when such payments are triggered by the transaction  iii authorization for the sec rules requiring public companies to include in a company s proxy statement certain shareholders nominations for the board of directors  iv new independence requirements for a company s compensation committee  v requirements that a public company adopt a policy mandating recovery of incentive compensation from a current or former executive in the event a restatement of the financial statement is required due to material noncompliance with the sec s financial reporting requirements  and vi enhanced disclosure of the compensation paid to a ceo to include such compensation relative to the company s performance and to the median employee compensation 
some of these requirements have become final by the adoption of implementing regulations 
as the various provisions of the dodd frank act become effective  the company is adopting the necessary policies and procedures to assure it is in compliance 
the bank the bank became a state chartered bank on november   following approval by the pa dob of the bank s application to convert from a national bank charter to a state bank charter 
as a nationally chartered bank  the bank had been subject to regulation  supervision and examination by the office of the comptroller of the currency 
the bank is now supervised jointly by the pa dob and the fdic 
the bank s deposits are insured by the fdic up to applicable legal limits 
some of the aspects of the lending and deposit business of the bank that are regulated by these agencies include personal lending  mortgage lending and reserve requirements 
the approval of these agencies is required for the establishment of additional store offices 
the bank is also subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations which set forth specific restrictions and procedural requirements with respect to the payment of dividends to the company  extension of credit  credit practices  the disclosure of credit terms and discrimination in credit transactions 
under the federal deposit insurance act  subject to certain exceptions  no person may acquire control of the bank without giving at least sixty days prior written notice to the fdic 
under this act and its regulations  control of the bank is generally presumed to be the power to vote ten percent or more of the common stock 
the fdic is empowered to disapprove any such acquisition of control 
the amount of funds that the bank may lend to a single borrower is limited generally under the pennsylvania banking code of to of the aggregate of its capital  surplus and undivided profits and capital securities all as defined by statute and regulation 
the fdic has authority under the financial institutions supervisory act to prohibit state banks from engaging in any activity  which  in the fdic s opinion  constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting their businesses 
the federal reserve board has similar authority with respect to the company 
as a consequence of the extensive regulation of commercial banking activities in the united states  the company s business is particularly susceptible to the effects of federal and state legislation and regulations  which may affect the cost of doing business 
the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of usa patriot act imposes additional obligations on us financial institutions  including banks  to implement policies  procedures and controls  which are reasonably designed to detect and report instances of money laundering and the financing of terrorism 
in addition  provisions of the usa patriot act require the federal financial institution regulatory agencies to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution s anti money laundering activities when reviewing bank applications 
the emergency economic stabilization act of  signed into law on october   authorized the secretary of the us department of the treasury treasury to establish the troubled assets relief program tarp to purchase troubled assets 
troubled assets are broadly defined to include residential or commercial mortgages and any securities  obligations or other instruments that are based on  or related to  such mortgages  also included are financial instruments the treasury determined to purchase in order to promote financial market stability 
pursuant to the tarp  the treasury established the capital purchase program cpp through which it made capital investments in banking institutions in order to strengthen and stabilize us financial institutions 
the dodd frank act capped the tarp purchase authority at billion  down from the billion originally allocated 
after october   no new tarp investments could be made 
the bank did not participate in the tarp or the cpp in  or also in october  the fdic announced the temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp  a guarantee program designed to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system by guaranteeing newly issued senior unsecured debt of banks  thrifts and certain holding companies and by providing full coverage of noninterest bearing deposit transaction accounts  regardless of dollar amount 
the bank participated in a component of the fdic s tlgp called the transaction account guarantee program tagp 
under that program  all noninterest bearing transaction accounts were fully guaranteed by the fdic for the entire amount in the account through december  the dodd frank act extended this full deposit guarantee until january  coverage under the tagp is in addition to and separate from the coverage available under the fdic s general deposit insurance rules 
national monetary policy in addition to being affected by general economic conditions  the earnings and growth of the company are affected by the policies of regulatory authorities  including the pa dob  the frb and the fdic 
an important function of the frb is to regulate the money supply and credit conditions 
among the instruments used to implement these objectives are open market operations in us government securities  setting the discount rate and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits 
these instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of credit  bank loans  investments and deposits and their use may also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits 
the monetary policies and regulations of the frb have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
the effects of such policies upon the future business  earnings and growth of the company cannot be predicted

risk factors the company s financial results are subject to a number of risks 
the factors discussed below highlight risks that management believes are most relevant to the company s current operations 
this list does not capture all risks associated with the company s business 
additional risks  including those that generally affect the banking and financial services industries and those that management currently believes are immaterial may also negatively impact the company s liquidity  financial position  or results of operations 
changes in the credit risk of our borrowers could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our results of operations and financial condition are affected by the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans 
lending money is an essential part of the banking business 
however  borrowers do not always repay their loans 
the risk of non payment is affected by changes in economic conditions  the credit risks of a particular borrower  the duration of the loan and in the case of a collateralized loan  uncertainties as to the future value of the collateral and other factors 
consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower s continuing financial stability and thus are more likely to be affected by adverse personal circumstances 
furthermore  the application of various federal and state laws  including bankruptcy and insolvency laws  may limit the amount that can be recovered on these loans 
while we intend to maintain a prudent approach to extending credit by undertaking due diligence and credit scoring to determine the risk of each credit application  there can be no guarantee that these measures will be sufficient to mitigate our exposure to credit risk 
if we fail to adequately manage our credit risk  we could be materially and adversely affected 
we may be required to make further increases in our provisions for loan losses and to charge off additional loans in the future  which could materially adversely affect us 
there is no precise method of predicting loan losses 
we can give no assurance that our all is or will be sufficient to absorb actual loan losses 
we maintain an all  which is established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense  and which represents management s best estimate of probable future losses within the bank s existing portfolio of loans 
the allowance  in the judgment of management  is necessary to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
the level of the allowance reflects management s continuing evaluation of specific credit risks  loan loss experience  current loan portfolio quality  present economic  political and regulatory conditions  industry concentrations and other unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio 
the determination of the appropriate level of the all inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends  all of which may undergo material changes 
changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers  new information regarding existing loans  identification of additional problem loans and other factors  both within and outside of our control  may require us to increase our all 
increases in nonperforming loans have a significant impact on our all 
while nationally  the economy is slowly recovering  certain sectors  such as real estate  remain weak and unemployment remains high 
until the economy fully recovers  including the economic conditions in our market areas  we may continue to be negatively impacted and we could continue to experience increased delinquencies and credit losses  particularly with respect to real estate construction loans  land acquisition and development loans and one to four family residential mortgage loans 
in addition  bank regulatory agencies periodically review our all and may require us to increase the provision for loan losses or to recognize further loan charge offs  based on judgments that differ from those of management 
if loan charge offs in future periods exceed our all  we will need to record additional provisions to increase our all 
furthermore  growth in our loan portfolio would generally lead to an increase in the provision for loan losses 
any increases in our all will result in a negative impact on net income and capital and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our high percentage of commercial loans presents a greater risk of non payment 
generally  commercial and industrial  commercial construction and land development and commercial real estate loans present a greater risk of non payment by a borrower than other types of loans 
these loans comprised  and  respectively  of our loan portfolio at december  the market value of real estate  particularly real estate held for investment  can fluctuate significantly in a relatively short period of time 
in addition  the economic downturn has caused several businesses to close 
if the value of the real estate or other business assets serving as collateral for our loan portfolio were to decline materially  a significant part of our loan portfolio could become under collateralized  resulting in a material adverse effect on our provision for loan losses and on our operating results 
our earnings and financial condition may be negatively impacted by a continued downturn in the economy of south central pennsylvania 
metro s business is concentrated in south central pennsylvania 
our earnings and financial condition are dependent upon the growth in businesses  population  income  deposits and housing in this geographic area 
in the previous twelve months  south central pennsylvania has seen the opening of few businesses  the closing of manufacturing properties and offices and continued layoffs of personnel  although state wide the employment rate is slightly better than at the beginning of the fiscal year 
because of the concentration of our business in this region  we are unable to spread the risks of the slow economy over a large geographic area 
while we experienced a growth in our total deposits in  a sluggish economy could slow that growth in and otherwise adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 
unfavorable economic and market conditions due to the current global financial crisis may materially and adversely affect us 
economic and market conditions in the united states and around the world deteriorated significantly during the recession and may remain depressed for the foreseeable future 
amid signs of an improving us economy eg  fewer claims for jobless benefits at the beginning of  improving manufacturing activity and rising consumer confidence  the economic outlook remains subject to high uncertainty and downside risks 
the crisis in the european union persists and could threaten the us recovery 
conditions such as slowing or negative growth and the sub prime debt devaluation crisis have resulted in a low level of liquidity in many financial markets and extreme volatility in credit  equity and fixed income markets 
these economic developments could have various effects on us  including insolvency of major customers and a negative impact on the investment income we are able to earn on our investment portfolio 
the potential effects of the current global financial crisis are difficult to forecast and mitigate 
as a consequence  our operating results for a particular period are difficult to predict 
distress in the credit markets and issues relating to liquidity among financial institutions have resulted in the failure of some financial institutions around the world and others have been forced to seek acquisition partners 
the united states and other governments have taken unprecedented steps in efforts to continue or stabilize the financial system  including investing in financial institutions 
there can be no assurance that these efforts will succeed 
we could be materially adversely affected by continued or accelerated disruption and volatility in financial markets  continued capital and liquidity concerns regarding financial institutions  limitations resulting from further governmental action in an effort to continue the stabilization or provide additional regulation of the financial system  or recessionary conditions that are deeper or longer lasting than currently anticipated 
the bank cannot be assured that any governmental action would benefit the bank 
our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected by other than temporary impairment otti charges relating to our investment portfolio 
we may be required to record future impairment charges on our investment securities if they suffer declines in value that we determine are other than temporary 
numerous factors  including the lack of liquidity for resales of certain investment securities  the absence of reliable pricing information for investment securities  adverse changes in the business climate  adverse regulatory actions or unanticipated changes in the competitive environment  could have a negative effect on our investment portfolio in future periods 
if an impairment charge is significant enough  it could affect the ability of the bank to pay dividends to us  which could materially adversely affect us and our ability to pay dividends to shareholders 
significant impairment charges could also negatively impact our regulatory capital ratios and result in us not being classified as well capitalized for regulatory purposes 
we may be required to pay higher fdic insurance premiums or special assessments which may adversely affect our earnings 
poor economic conditions and the resulting bank failures have increased the costs of the fdic and depleted its deposit insurance fund 
additional bank failures may prompt the fdic to increase its premiums above the recently increased levels or to issue special assessments 
we generally are unable to control the amount of premiums or special assessments that our subsidiary bank is required to pay for fdic insurance 
any future changes in the calculation or assessment of fdic insurance premiums may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and our ability to continue to pay dividends on our common stock at the current rate or at all 
we plan to continue to grow rapidly but there are limitations and risks associated with rapid growth 
prior to  we experienced significant growth in net income  assets  loans and deposits 
our increase in total deposits slowed to only in  however  in we experienced a increase in total deposits 
our growth continues to be achieved through organic growth 
we intend to continue to expand our business and operations in our existing central pennsylvania footprint as well as open new stores in metro philadelphia 
subject to regulatory approvals  we are targeting to open approximately new stores over the next five years 
we anticipate the cost to construct and furnish a new store will be approximately to million  excluding the cost to lease or purchase the land on which the store is located 
our ability to manage growth successfully will depend on our ability to attract qualified personnel and maintain cost controls and asset quality while attracting additional loans and deposits on favorable terms with our high quality service and low fees  as well as on factors beyond our control  such as economic conditions and competition 
if we grow too quickly and are not able to attract qualified personnel  control costs and maintain asset quality  this continued rapid growth could materially adversely affect us 
growth may require us to raise additional capital in the future  but that capital may not be available when it is needed and on terms favorable to current shareholders 
we anticipate that our existing capital will satisfy our capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
in september  we completed a successful common stock offering which raised nearly million 
this additional capital provides the foundation for aggressive store growth  both de novo and through acquisitions of existing banks 
however  we may at some point need to raise additional capital to support continued growth 
our ability to raise additional capital  if needed  will depend on various matters  including our financial condition  liquidity and results of operations  as well as on conditions in the capital markets at that time  which are outside of our control 
the current financial crisis affecting the banking system and financial markets  which has resulted in a tightening in the credit markets  could have an adverse effect on our ability to raise additional capital 
accordingly  we cannot assure you of our ability to raise additional capital  if needed  on favorable terms  or at all 
if we cannot raise additional capital when needed  our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth  branching and or acquisitions could be materially impaired 
if we raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other securities  it would likely dilute the ownership interests of current shareholders and could dilute the per share book value and earnings per share of our common stock 
consequently  a capital raise through issuance of additional shares may have an adverse impact on our stock price 
furthermore  new investors also may have rights  preferences and privileges senior to our current shareholders  which may adversely impact current shareholders 
we must continue to attract and retain qualified personnel and maintain cost controls and asset quality 
our ability to manage growth successfully will depend on our ability to continue to attract and retain management experienced in banking and financial services and familiar with the communities in our market area 
as we grow  we must be able to attract and retain qualified additional management and loan officers with the appropriate level of experience and knowledge about our market areas to implement our operating strategy 
the unexpected loss of services of any key management personnel  or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future  could materially adversely affect us 
if we grow too quickly and are not able to attract qualified personnel and maintain cost controls and asset quality  this continued rapid growth could materially adversely affect us 
we may be adversely affected by lawsuits alleging trademark infringement 
on or about june   we changed our name and the name of the bank and began using the red m logo 
several companies in the united states  including companies in the banking and financial services industries  use variations of the word metro and the letter m as part of a trademark or trade name 
as such  we face potential objections to our use of these marks 
on or about june   members st federal credit union members st  filed a complaint in the united states district court for the middle district of pennsylvania against metro bancorp  inc and metro bank 
members st claimed federal trademark infringement  federal unfair competition and common law trademark infringement and unfair competition by metro in metro s use of a red letter m alone  or in conjunction with its trade name metro 
members st alleged that such use infringes members st s federally registered and common law trademark for the mark mst stylized 
on february   the parties to this lawsuit executed and filed with the court a stipulation and proposed order of dismissal under which the complaint against metro and the bank was dismissed without prejudice 
while metro made certain modifications to its logos  we can provide no assurance that the members st lawsuit will not be reinstituted at a later time or that other trademark infringement actions will not be brought against us 
changes in interest rates could reduce our net income and liquidity 
our operating income  net income and liquidity depend to a great extent on our net interest margin  ie  the difference between the interest yields we receive on loans  securities and other interest earning assets and the interest rates we pay on interest bearing deposits  borrowings and other liabilities 
these rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control  including competition  general economic conditions and monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities  including the board of governors of the federal reserve system 
if the rate of interest we pay on our interest bearing deposits  borrowings and other liabilities increases more than the rate of interest we receive on loans  securities and other interest earning assets  our net interest income and therefore our earnings and liquidity could be materially adversely affected 
our earnings and liquidity could also be materially adversely affected if the rates on our loans  securities and other investments fall more quickly than those on our deposits  borrowings and other liabilities 
our operations are subject to risks and uncertainties surrounding our exposure to change in the interest rate environment 
competition from other banks and financial institutions in originating loans  attracting deposits and providing various financial services may adversely affect our profitability and liquidity 
we have substantial competition in originating loans  both commercial and consumer in our market area 
this competition comes principally from other banks  savings institutions  mortgage banking companies and other lenders 
several of our competitors enjoy advantages  including greater financial resources and access to capital  higher lending limits  a wider geographic presence  more accessible branch office locations  more aggressive marketing campaigns  better brand recognition  the ability to offer a wider array of services or more favorable pricing alternatives  as well as lower origination and operating costs 
this competition could reduce our net income and liquidity by decreasing the number and size of loans that the bank originates and the interest rates we may charge on these loans 
the same competitor advantages listed above exist in attempting to attract business and consumer deposits 
the bank faces substantial competition from other insured depository institutions such as banks  savings institutions and credit unions  as well as institutions offering uninsured investment alternatives  including money market funds 
these competitors may offer higher interest rates than the bank  which could decrease the deposits that the bank attracts or require the bank to increase its rates to retain existing deposits or attract new deposits 
increased deposit competition could materially adversely affect our ability to generate the funds necessary for lending operations 
as a result  we may need to seek other sources of funds that may be more expensive to obtain and could increase our cost of funds 
our share price may fluctuate 
the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to many factors  including  but not limited to actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations  liquidity or financial condition  changes in our earnings estimates or those of analysts  our failure to pay dividends on common stock  publication of research reports about us or the banking industry generally  changes in market valuations of similar companies  the effects of and changes in  trade  monetary and fiscal policies  including interest rate policies of the board of governors of the federal reserve system  general economic or business conditions  either nationally  regionally or in the communities in which we do business  may be less favorable than expected  resulting in  among other things  a deterioration in credit quality and loan performance or a reduced demand for credit  continued effects of the aftermath of recessionary conditions and the impacts on the economy in general and our customers in particular  including adverse impacts on loan utilization rates as well as delinquencies  defaults and customers ability to meet credit obligations  our ability to manage current elevated levels of impaired assets  the impact of the dodd frank act and other changes in financial services laws and regulations including laws concerning taxes  banking  securities and insurance  changes resulting from legislative and regulatory actions with respect to the current economic and financial industry environment  interest rate  market and monetary fluctuations  the results of the regulatory examination and supervision process  unanticipated regulatory or legal proceedings and liabilities and other costs  compliance with laws and regulatory requirements of federal  state and local agencies  our ability to continue to grow our business internally and through acquisition and successful integration of new or acquired entities while controlling costs  continued levels of loan volume origination  the adequacy of the all  deposit flows  the willingness of customers to substitute competitors products and services for our products and services and vice versa  based on price  quality  relationship or otherwise  changes in consumer spending and saving habits relative to the financial services we provide  the ability to hedge certain risks economically  the loss of certain key officers  changes in accounting principles  policies and guidelines  the timely development of competitive new products and services by us and the acceptance of such products and services by customers  rapidly changing technology  continued relationships with major customers  effect of terrorist attacks and threats of actual war  other economic  competitive  governmental  regulatory and technological factors affecting the company s operations  pricing  products and services  and our success at managing the risks involved in the foregoing 
stock markets  in general  have experienced over the past few years and continue to experience significant price and volume volatility and the market price of our common stock may continue to be subject to similar market fluctuations that may be unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 
increased market volatility could result in a substantial decline in the market price of our common stock 
our common stock is not insured by any governmental entity and  therefore  an investment in our common stock involves risk 
our common stock is not a deposit account or other obligation of any bank and is not insured by the fdic or any other governmental entity and is subject to investment risk  including possible loss 
there may be future sales of our common stock  which may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we issued million shares of our common stock in a public offering in september we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock  including securities that are convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of our common stock 
additionally  the sale of substantial amounts of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our common stock  whether directly by us or by existing common stockholders in the secondary market  the perception that such sales could occur or the availability for future sale of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our common stock could  in turn  materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity related securities 
in addition  we may issue other equity securities that are senior to our common stock in the future for a number of reasons  including  without limitation  to support operations and growth  to maintain our capital ratios and to comply with any future changes in regulatory standards 
our common stock is currently traded on the nasdaq global select market 
during the twelve months ended december   the average daily trading volume for our common stock was approximately  shares 
as a result  a sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may place significant downward pressure on the market price of our common stock 
furthermore  it may be difficult for holders to resell their shares at prices they find attractive  or at all 
our common stock is subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness and preferred stock and effectively subordinated to all indebtedness and preferred equity claims against our subsidiaries 
shares of our common stock are common equity interests in us and  as such  will rank junior to all of our existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities 
additionally  holders of our common stock are subject to the prior dividend and liquidation rights of holders of our outstanding preferred stock 
our board of directors is authorized to issue additional classes or series of preferred stock without any action on the part of the holders of our common stock 
furthermore  our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon any of our subsidiaries liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of that subsidiary s creditors and preferred stockholders 
our ability to pay dividends depends upon the results of operations of our subsidiaries 
neither the company nor the bank has declared or paid cash dividends on its common stock since the bank began operations in june our board of directors intends to follow a policy of retaining earnings for the purpose of increasing the company s and the bank s capital for the foreseeable future 
although the board of directors anticipates establishing a cash dividend policy in the future  no assurance can be given that cash dividends will be paid 
holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends if  as and when declared from time to time by our board of directors in its sole discretion out of funds legally available for that purpose  after debt service payments and payments of dividends required to be paid on our outstanding preferred stock  if any 
while we are not subject to certain restrictions on dividends applicable to a bank  our ability to pay dividends to the holders of our common stock will depend to a large extent upon the amount of dividends paid by the bank to metro 
the company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiary  the bank 
there are various legal and regulatory limitations on the extent to which the bank can  among other things  finance  or otherwise supply funds to  the company 
specifically  dividends from the bank are the principal source of the company s cash funds and there are certain legal restrictions under pennsylvania law and pennsylvania banking regulations on the payment of dividends by state chartered banks 
the relevant regulatory agencies also have authority to prohibit the company and the bank from engaging in what  in the opinion of such regulatory body  constitutes an unsafe or unsound banking practice 
the payment of dividends could  depending upon the financial condition of the company and the bank  be deemed to constitute such an unsafe or unsound practice 
anti takeover provisions may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if the change in control would be beneficial to our shareholders 
we are a pennsylvania corporation 
anti takeover provisions in pennsylvania law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us 
these provisions could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could reduce the amount that shareholders might receive if we are sold 
for example  our articles of incorporation provide that our board of directors may issue up to  shares of preferred stock without shareholder approval  subject to the rights of the outstanding shares of preferred stock 
in addition  anti takeover provisions in our articles of incorporation and federal and state laws  including pennsylvania law  may restrict a third party s ability to obtain control of the company and may prevent shareholders from receiving a premium for their shares of our common stock 
our executive officers  directors and other five percent or greater shareholders own a significant percentage of our company and could influence matters requiring approval by our shareholders 
as of december   our executive officers and directors as a group owned and had the right to vote approximately of our outstanding stock and other five percent or greater shareholders  which are institutional holders who have sole or shared voting power with the beneficial owners of the stock  owned and had the right to vote approximately of our outstanding common stock 
these shareholders  acting together  would be able to influence matters requiring approval by our shareholders  including the election of directors 
this concentration of ownership might also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of metro 
we operate in a highly regulated environment  changes in laws and regulations and accounting principles may materially adversely affect us 
we are subject to extensive regulation  supervision and legislation which govern almost all aspects of our operations 
the laws and regulations applicable to the banking industry could change at any time and are primarily intended for the protection of customers  depositors and the deposit insurance funds 
any changes to these laws  regulations or any applicable accounting principles may materially adversely affect us 
the dodd frank act became law on july  and will implement significant changes to the us financial system 
information concerning this law is incorporated by reference to the discussion in this report under item business supervision and regulation 
among the key provisions of the dodd frank act is the creation of the bureau of consumer financial protection bureau  which is an independent bureau within the federal reserve system with broad authority in the consumer finance industry 
the bureau has the authority through rulemaking  orders  policy statements  guidance and enforcement actions to administer and enforce federal consumer financial laws 
these laws were previously administered for all banking institutions by different federal agencies  including the fdic and the federal reserve  both current federal regulators of the bank and company  respectively 
going forward  the bureau will administer federal consumer protection laws for all financial institutions with total assets greater than billion 
the fdic will continue to administer such laws for metro as long as our total assets do not exceed billion 
the bureau s jurisdiction over the bank will be secondary to the fdic  however  the bureau will have authority to require reports from and to conduct limited examinations of the bank 
the impact of the dodd frank act on the company s financial position cannot be estimated at this time 
as the required regulations are adopted by the applicable federal agencies and the various provisions of the new law are implemented  the company will adopt the necessary policies and procedures to assure its compliance 
our internal control systems are inherently limited 
our systems of internal controls  disclosure controls and corporate governance policies and procedures are inherently limited 
the inherent limitations of our system of internal controls include the use of judgment in decision making that can be faulty  breakdowns can occur because of human error or mistakes  and controls can be circumvented by individual acts or by collusion of two or more people 
the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and any design may not succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 
because of the inherent limitation of a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected  which may have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
additionally  any plans of remediation for any identified limitations may be ineffective in improving our internal controls 
our financial performance may suffer if our information technology is unable to keep pace with growth or industry developments 
effective and competitive delivery of our products and services is increasingly dependent upon information technology resources and processes  both those provided internally as well as those provided through third party vendors 
in addition to better serving customers  the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables us to reduce costs 
our future success will depend  in part  upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services to enhance customer convenience  as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations 
many of our competitors have greater resources to invest in technological improvements 
additionally  as technology in the financial services industry changes and evolves  keeping pace becomes increasingly complex and expensive for us 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services  which could reduce our ability to compete effectively 
a failure in or a breach of our information systems or infrastructure  including as a result of cyber attacks  could disrupt our business  damage our reputation  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in the ordinary course of the bank s business activities  including the ongoing maintenance of deposits  loan and other account relationships for the bank s customers  receiving instructions and effecting transactions for those customers and other users of the bank s products and services  the bank regularly collects  processes  transmits and stores significant amounts of confidential information regarding its customers  employees and others 
in addition to confidential information regarding the bank s customers  employees and others  the company and in some cases a third party  compiles  processes  transmits and stores proprietary  non public information concerning its own business  operations  plans and strategies 
information security risks for the bank and other financial institutions have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies  the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions  and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime  hackers  terrorists and other external parties 
our company relies on digital technologies  computer and email systems  software  and networks to conduct secure processing  transmission and storage of confidential information 
in addition  to access our products and services  our customers may use personal smart phones  tablet pcs and other mobile devices that are beyond our control systems 
our technologies  systems  networks and our customers devices have been subject to  and are likely to continue to be the target of  cyber attacks  computer viruses  malicious code  phishing attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized use  loss or destruction of our or our customers confidential information  or otherwise disrupt our or our customers or other third parties business operations 
we believe that it is more likely than not that such attempted attacks may continue 
although the company uses a variety of physical  procedural and technological safeguards to protect confidential information from mishandling  misuse or loss  these safeguards do not provide absolute assurance that mishandling  misuse or loss of the information will not occur  and that if mishandling  misuse or loss of the information did occur  those events will be promptly detected and addressed 
a failure in or breach of the company s operational or information security system  or those of a third party service provider  as a result of cyber attacks or information security breaches could have a material adverse affect on our business  damage our reputation  increase our costs and or cause significant losses 
although the company believes that it currently has adequate information security procedures and other safeguards in place and the company will continue to make it a priority to develop and enhance controls and processes designed to safeguard our information systems from attacks  damage or unauthorized access  as information security risks and cyber threats continue to evolve  the company may be required to expend substantial resources to further enhance its information security measures and or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities
