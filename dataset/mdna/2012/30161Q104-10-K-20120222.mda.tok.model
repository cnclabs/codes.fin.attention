overview we are a biotechnology company committed to developing small molecule therapies for the treatment of cancer 
we are focusing our proprietary resources and development efforts exclusively on cabozantinib  or xl  our most advanced product candidate  in order to maximize the therapeutic and commercial potential of this compound 
we believe cabozantinib has the potential to be a high quality  broadly active  differentiated pharmaceutical product that can make a meaningful difference in the lives of patients 
we have also established a portfolio of other novel compounds that we believe have the potential to address serious unmet medical needs  many of which are being advanced by partners as part of collaborations 
cabozantinib cabozantinib inhibits met  vegfr and ret  proteins that are key drivers of tumor growth  vascularization and or metastasis 
cabozantinib has shown novel and differentiated activity in multiple cancer indications 
the current clinical program for cabozantinib is focused on the treatment of metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer  or crpc  and medullary thyroid cancer but also includes the evaluation of other tumor types 
exelixis has implemented a strategy to investigate cabozantinib in a comprehensive development program for crpc to potentially generate a product that could effectively compete in the crpc marketplace 
two phase pivotal trials  comet cabozantinib met inhibition crpc efficacy trial  formerly known as xl and comet cabozantinib met inhibition crpc efficacy trial  formerly known as xl  were designed to provide an opportunity to commercially differentiate cabozantinib as an oncology agent with a potentially beneficial impact on overall survival  pain palliation and narcotic usage 
we expect to initiate the comet trial with an overall survival endpoint in the first half of we initiated the comet trial with a pain palliation endpoint in december we also initiated a rolling submission of a new drug application  or nda  for cabozantinib in medullary thyroid cancer in december following our october announcement of the top line results of the primary endpoint of our ongoing phase clinical trial of cabozantinib as a potential treatment for medullary thyroid cancer  known as the exam trial efficacy of xl cabozantinib in advanced medullary thyroid cancer 
we expect to expand the cabozantinib development program to other solid tumor indications  based on encouraging interim data that have emerged from the randomized discontinuation trial  or rdt  investigating cabozantinib in nine distinct tumor types  as well as other clinical trials 
objective tumor responses have been 
table of contents observed in patients treated with cabozantinib in of individual tumor types investigated to date  reflecting the broad potential clinical activity and commercial opportunity of this new product candidate 
interim data suggest that cabozantinib has shown novel activity against bone and soft tissue lesions in patients with crpc 
we have also observed resolution of metastatic bone lesions on bone scan in patients with metastatic breast cancer  renal cell carcinoma  thyroid cancer and melanoma 
interim data from the crpc cohort of the rdt reported at the american society of clinical oncology annual meeting in june demonstrated that in addition to improvement of bone lesions on bone scan observed in the majority of patients  of patients with bone metastases and bone pain at baseline also experienced alleviation of pain 
this observation has been corroborated in a non randomized expansion cohort  or nre  of crpc patients in the rdt  which collected prospectively defined patient reported outcomes on pain and narcotic use 
interim data from the nre reported at the aacr nci eortc symposium on molecular targets and cancer therapeutics in november demonstrated that of crpc patients with moderate to severe pain in the nre experienced durable pain reduction greater than or equal to 
the median best pain reduction was 
in addition  these interim data indicated that of crpc patients in the nre with moderate to severe bone pain and on narcotics at baseline were able to reduce or discontinue narcotic medication 
lower starting doses of cabozantinib are being evaluated through a dose ranging study in crpc patients conducted through an investigator sponsored trial  or ist 
preliminary data from the ist demonstrate that a daily dose of mg resulted in a rate of bone scan responses similar to that of a mg daily dose used in the rdt and was associated with improved tolerability compared with the higher dose 
in addition  preliminary data from a cohort of crpc patients in the nre treated at a daily dose of mg demonstrate pain palliation responses consistent with observations at the mg daily dose 
it is a priority for us to generate additional data from the rdt as well as other ongoing exploratory clinical trials for cabozantinib in a broad range of tumor types  including ovarian cancer  melanoma  breast cancer  non small cell lung cancer  hepatocellular cancer  renal cell carcinoma and differentiated thyroid cancer  to support further prioritization of our clinical and commercial options 
in november  we entered into a cooperative research and development agreement  or crada  with the national cancer institute s cancer therapy evaluation program  or ctep  for further evaluation of cabozantinib across multiple tumor types and in combination with other anti tumor agents in a cost effective manner for exelixis 
we believe that cabozantinib s clinical profile is compelling and will allow commercial differentiation  assuming regulatory approval 
collaborations we have established collaborations with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  including bristol myers squibb company  or bristol myers squibb  sanofi  genentech  inc a wholly owned member of the roche group  glaxosmithkline  merck known as msd outside of the united states and canada and daiichi sankyo company limited  or daiichi sankyo  for various compounds and programs in our portfolio 
pursuant to these collaborations  we have out licensed compounds or programs to a partner for further development and commercialization  generally have no further unfunded cost obligations related to such compounds or programs and may be entitled to receive research funding  milestones and royalties or a share of profits from commercialization 
several of the out licensed compounds are in multiple phase studies and could potentially be of significant value to us if their development progresses successfully 
with respect to our partnered compounds  we are eligible to receive potential milestone payments under our collaborations totaling approximately billion in the aggregate on a non risk adjusted basis  of which are related to clinical development milestones  are related to regulatory milestones and are related to commercial milestones 
certain factors important to understanding our financial condition and results of operations successful development of drugs is inherently difficult and uncertain 
our business requires significant investments in research and development over many years  often for products that fail during the research and development process 
our long term prospects depend upon our ability  particularly with respect to cabozantinib  and the ability of our partners to successfully commercialize new therapeutics in highly competitive areas such as cancer treatment 
our financial performance is driven by many factors  including those described below 

table of contents clinical development of cabozantinib and other product candidates on december   we entered into a worldwide collaboration agreement with bristol myers squibb for cabozantinib and xl  which was amended and restated as of april  by and between us and bristol myers squibb  or as amended and restated  the agreement 
upon effectiveness of the agreement in december  bristol myers squibb made a nonrefundable upfront cash payment of million for the development and commercialization rights to both programs 
the agreement required bristol myers squibb to make additional license payments to us of million  which were received during on june   we regained full rights to develop and commercialize cabozantinib under the agreement following receipt of notice from bristol myers squibb of its decision to terminate the agreement  solely as to cabozantinib  on a worldwide basis 
bristol myers squibb informed us that the termination was based upon its review of cabozantinib in the context of bristol myers squibb s overall research and development priorities and pipeline products 
on june   in connection with the termination  we received a million transition payment from bristol myers squibb in satisfaction of its obligations under the agreement to continue to fund its share of development costs for cabozantinib for a period of three months following the notice of termination 
as a result of the termination  bristol myers squibb s license relating to cabozantinib terminated and its rights to cabozantinib reverted to us  and we received  subject to certain terms and conditions  licenses from bristol myers squibb to research  develop and commercialize cabozantinib 
on july   we and one of our wholly owned subsidiaries received written notification from bristol myers squibb of its decision to terminate the agreement on a worldwide basis as to xl the termination was made pursuant to the terms of the agreement and became effective on october  we are focusing our proprietary resources and development efforts on the development of cabozantinib 
however  the product candidate may fail to show adequate safety or efficacy in clinical testing 
furthermore  predicting the timing of the initiation or completion of clinical trials is difficult  and our trials may be delayed due to many factors  including factors outside of our control 
the future development path of cabozantinib depends upon the results of each stage of clinical development 
we expect to incur increased expenses for the development of cabozantinib as it advances in clinical development 
with the exception of activities related to cabozantinib  we are discontinuing efforts with respect to all of our compounds and programs that are not funded by partners pursuant to collaboration agreements and are considering collaborations or other external opportunities for the continued development of these compounds and programs 
we expect discovery and clinical activities under various collaborations to continue to be funded by partners until we complete our contractual obligations 
limited sources of revenues we have no pharmaceutical products that have received marketing approval  and we have generated no revenues to date from the sale of such products 
we do not expect to generate revenues from the sale of pharmaceutical products in the near term and expect that all of our near term revenues  such as research and development funding  license fees and milestone payments and royalty revenues  will be generated from collaboration agreements with our current and potential future partners 
milestones under these agreements may be tied to factors that are outside of our control  such as significant clinical or regulatory events with respect to compounds that have been licensed to our partners 

table of contents liquidity as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and long term investments  which included restricted cash and investments of million and approximately million of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities that we are required to maintain on deposit with silicon valley bank or one of its affiliates pursuant to covenants in our loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank 
in february  we raised approximately million in net proceeds from a public offering of our common stock 
we anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  long term investments and funding that we expect to receive from existing collaborators  together with the anticipated proceeds from this offering  will enable us to maintain our operations for a period of at least months following the filing date of this report 
however  our future capital requirements will be substantial and depend on many factors  including the following the progress and scope of the development activity with respect to cabozantinib  whether we elect to pay cash or to issue shares of our common stock in respect of any conversion of our principal  prepayments or payments of interest in connection with the secured convertible notes we issued to entities affiliated with deerfield management company  lp  or deerfield  under a note purchase agreement  whether we elect to prepay the amounts advanced under our loan from silicon valley bank  the level of payments received under existing collaboration agreements  licensing agreements and other arrangements  the degree to which we conduct funded development activity on behalf of partners to whom we have out licensed compounds  and whether we enter into new collaboration agreements  licensing agreements or other arrangements including  in particular with respect to cabozantinib that provide additional capital 
our minimum liquidity needs are also determined by financial covenants in our loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank and our note purchase agreement with deerfield  as well as other factors  which are described under liquidity and capital resources cash requirements 
our ability to raise additional funds may be severely impaired if any of our product candidates fails to show adequate safety or efficacy in clinical testing 
deerfield facility on june   we entered into a note purchase agreement with deerfield pursuant to which  on july   we sold to deerfield an aggregate of million initial principal amount of our secured convertible notes due june for an aggregate purchase price of million  less closing fees and expenses of approximately million 
the outstanding principal amount of the notes bears interest in the annual amount of million  payable quarterly in arrears 
we will be required to make mandatory prepayments on the notes on an annual basis in  and equal to of certain payments from our collaborative arrangements received during the prior fiscal year  subject to a maximum annual prepayment amount of million and  for payments due in january and  a minimum prepayment amount of million 
we may also prepay all or a portion not less than million of the principal amount of the notes at an optional prepayment price based on a discounted principal amount during the first three years of the term  subject to a prepayment premium determined as of the date of prepayment  plus accrued and unpaid interest  plus in the case of a prepayment of the full principal amount of the notes other than prepayments upon the occurrence of specified transactions relating to a change of control or a substantial sale of assets  all accrued interest that would have accrued between the date of such prepayment and the next anniversary of the note purchase agreement 
in lieu of 
table of contents making any optional or mandatory prepayment in cash  subject to certain limitations including a cap on the number of shares issuable under the note purchase agreement  we have the right to convert all or a portion of the principal amount of the notes into  or satisfy all or any portion of the optional prepayment amounts or mandatory prepayment amounts other than the first million of mandatory prepayments required in and with shares of our common stock 
additionally  in lieu of making any payment of accrued and unpaid interest in respect of the notes in cash  subject to certain limitations  we may elect to satisfy any such payment with shares of our common stock 
the number of shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion or in settlement of principal and interest obligations will be based upon the discounted trading price of our common stock over a specified trading period 
upon certain changes of control of our company  a sale or transfer of assets in one transaction or a series of related transactions for a purchase price of more than million or a sale or transfer of more than of our assets  deerfield may require us to prepay the notes at the optional prepayment price  plus accrued and unpaid interest and any other accrued and reimbursable expenses  or the put price 
upon an event of default  deerfield may declare all or a portion of the put price to be immediately due and payable 
we also entered into a security agreement in favor of deerfield which provides that our obligations under the notes will be secured by substantially all of our assets except intellectual property 
the note purchase agreement and the security agreement include customary representations and warranties and covenants made by us  including restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness 
loan agreement with silicon valley bank on june   we amended our loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank to provide for a new seven year term loan in the amount of million 
the principal amount outstanding under the term loan accrues interest at per annum  which interest is due and payable monthly 
we are required to repay the term loan in one balloon principal payment  representing of the principal balance and accrued and unpaid interest  on may  we have the option to prepay all  but not less than all  of the amounts advanced under the term loan  provided that we pay all unpaid accrued interest thereon that is due through the date of such prepayment and the interest on the entire principal balance of the term loan that would otherwise have been paid after such prepayment date until the maturity date of the term loan 
in accordance with the terms of the loan and security agreement  we are required to maintain an amount equal to at least  but not to exceed  of the outstanding principal balance of the term loan and all equipment lines of credit under the loan and security agreement on deposit in one or more investment accounts with silicon valley bank or one of its affiliates 
any amounts outstanding under the term loan during the continuance of an event of default under the loan and security agreement will  at the election of silicon valley bank  bear interest at a per annum rate equal to 
if one or more events of default under the loan and security agreement occurs and continues beyond any applicable cure period  silicon valley bank may declare all or part of the obligations under the loan and security agreement to be immediately due and payable and stop advancing money or extending credit to us under the loan and security agreement 
restructuring plans during  we implemented two restructuring plans that resulted in an overall reduction in our workforce of employees 
in march  we implemented an additional restructuring plan that resulted in further terminations in taking into consideration employees who have since been recalled  there has been an aggregate reduction in headcount from the and restructuring plans of employees 
the restructuring plans are a consequence of our decision to focus our proprietary resources and development efforts on the late stage development and commercialization of cabozantinib 
in connection with the and restructuring plans  we have recorded aggregate restructuring charges of million  of which million related to termination benefits and million related to facility charges and the impairment of various assets 
our restrucuturing expense is primarily facility related 
table of contents charges that relate to our buildings in south san francisco  california and take into consideration our entry into two sublease agreements for portions of a building that we entered into in july as well as charges relating to the short term exit of the second floor of another building in december additionally  we had asset impairment charges of million relating to excess equipment and other assets  partially offset by cash proceeds of million from the sale of such assets 
with respect to our restructuring plans  we expect to incur additional restructuring charges of million relating to the previously mentioned exit and sublease of our south san francisco facilities 
these charges will be recorded through the end of  or the end of the building lease terms 
as of december   the and restructuring plans had resulted in aggregate cash expenditures of million net of million in cash received in connection with the sale of excess equipment and other assets  of which million was paid in and million was paid in we expect to pay an additional million  net of cash received from our subtenants  relating to facility costs 
we expect these additional facility costs to be paid through  or the end of our lease terms of the buildings 
the restructuring charges that we expect to incur in connection with the restructuring plans are subject to a number of assumptions  and actual results may materially differ 
we may also incur other material charges not currently contemplated due to events that may occur as a result of  or associated with  the restructuring plans 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements and related notes are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles which require us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition our revenues are derived from three primary sources license fees  milestone payments and collaborative agreement reimbursements 
revenues from license fees and milestone payments primarily consist of up front license fees and milestone payments received under various collaboration agreements 
we initially recognize upfront fees received from third party collaborators as unearned revenues and then recognize these amounts on a ratable basis over the expected term of the research collaboration 
therefore  any changes in the expected term of the research collaboration will impact revenue recognition for the given period 
often  the total research term is not contractually defined and an estimate of the term of our total obligation must be made 
for example  under the agreement with bristol myers squibb  we originally estimated our term to be through august  which 
table of contents was the estimated term of our performance obligations for xl we estimated that this would be the period over which we would be obligated to perform services and therefore the appropriate term with which to ratably recognize any license fees 
during the fourth quarter of  this estimate was extended to april as a result of the decision with bristol myers squibb to complete additional phase trial programs for xl on july   we received written notification from bristol myers squibb of its decision to terminate the agreement in its entirety 
as a result of the termination of the agreement  the estimated research term was revised to end on october  accordingly  we accelerated the remaining deferred revenue balance through the revised end of the research term and recognized million in revenue during the third quarter ended september  and the remaining million in revenue during the fourth quarter ended december  license fees are classified as license revenues in our consolidated statement of operations 
although milestone payments are generally non refundable once the milestone is achieved  we recognize milestone revenues on a straight line basis over the expected research term of the arrangement 
this typically results in a portion of a milestone being recognized on the date the milestone is achieved  with the balance being recognized over the remaining research term of the agreement 
in certain situations  we may receive milestone payments after the end of our period of continued involvement 
in such circumstances  we would recognize of the milestone revenues when the milestone is achieved 
milestones are classified as contract revenues in our consolidated statement of operations 
collaborative agreement reimbursement revenues consist of research and development support received from collaborators and are recorded as earned based on the performance requirements by both parties under the respective contracts 
under the agreement with bristol myers squibb and prior to its termination by bristol myers squibb as to cabozantinib  both parties were actively involved with compound development and certain research and development expenses were partially reimbursable to us 
on an annual basis  amounts owed by bristol myers squibb to us  net of amounts reimbursable to bristol myers squibb by us for the development of cabozantinib and xl  were recorded as collaboration reimbursement revenues 
conversely  research and development expenses would include the net settlement of amounts we owed bristol myers squibb for research and development expenses that bristol myers squibb incurred in connection with the development of cabozantinib  less amounts reimbursable to us by bristol myers squibb for the development of both cabozantinib and xl in annual periods when net research and development funding payments were payable to bristol myers squibb  these payments were presented as collaboration cost sharing expenses 
reimbursements under co development agreements were classified as collaboration reimbursement revenues  while reimbursements under other arrangements were classified as contract revenues in our consolidated statement of operations 
as a result of the termination of the agreement with bristol myers squibb  which became effective on october   reimbursement payments were presented as collaboration reimbursement revenues for the period ended december  we do not expect to record any further collaboration cost sharing expense or collaboration reimbursement revenues under our current collaborations 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our agreement with bristol myers squibb 
some of our research and licensing arrangements have multiple deliverables in order to meet our customer s needs 
for example  the arrangements may include a combination of intellectual property rights and research and development services 
multiple element revenue agreements are evaluated to determine whether the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone basis and whether objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item exists 
deliverables in an arrangement that do not meet the separation criteria are treated as one unit of accounting for purposes of revenue recognition 
generally  the revenue recognition guidance applicable to the final deliverable is followed for the combined unit of accounting 
for certain arrangements  the period of time over which certain deliverables will be provided is not contractually defined 
accordingly  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
for example  in  under our collaboration agreement with sanofi for the discovery of inhibitors of phosphoinositide kinase  or the agreement  we accelerated million in previously deferred revenue as a result of the termination of this agreement on december  instead of the previously estimated research term end date of july 
table of contents clinical trial accruals all of our clinical trials have been performed by third party contract research organizations  or cros  and other vendors 
we accrue costs for clinical trial activities performed by cros based upon the estimated amount of work completed on each trial 
for clinical trial expenses  the significant factors used in estimating accruals include the number of patients enrolled  the number of active clinical sites  and the duration for which the patients will be enrolled in the trial 
we monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible through internal reviews  correspondence with cros and review of contractual terms 
we base our estimates on the best information available at the time 
however  additional information may become available to us which will allow us to make a more accurate estimate in future periods 
in this event  we may be required to record adjustments to research and development expenses in future periods when the actual level of activity becomes more certain 
such increases or decreases in cost are generally considered to be changes in estimates and will be reflected in research and development expenses in the period first known 
for example  during the years ended december  and  we recorded a reduction related to prior periods of approximately million and million respectively  to our accrued clinical trial liabilities and research and development expenses primarily related to our phase and phase clinical trials for cabozantinib 
restructuring liability in connection with our and restructuring activities  we estimate facility related restructuring charges which represent the present value of the estimated facility costs for which we would obtain no future economic benefit offset by estimated future sublease income  including any credit or debit relating to existing deferred rent balances associated with the vacated building 
we derive our estimates based primarily on discussions with our brokers and our own view of market conditions based in part on discussions with potential subtenants 
these estimates require significant assumptions regarding the time required to contract with subtenants  the amount of idle space we would be able to sublease and potential future sublease rates 
the present value factor  which also affects the level of accreted interest expense that we will recognize as additional restructuring charges over the term of the lease  is based on our estimate of our credit risk adjusted borrowing rate at the time the initial lease related restructuring liability is calculated 
changes in the assumptions underlying our estimates could have a material impact on our restructuring charge and restructuring liability 
we are required to continue to update our estimate of our restructuring liability in future periods as conditions warrant  and we expect to further revise our estimate in future periods as we continue our discussions with potential subtenants 
in addition  in connection with our sublease efforts for two of our buildings in south san francisco  if we vacate and sublease these facilities for rates that are not significantly in excess of our costs  we would not likely recover the carrying value of certain assets associated with these facilities 
as such  we could potentially recognize additional asset impairment charges  in future periods  if we were to sublease parts of either of these buildings 
if the actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of restructuring charges could be materially impacted 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on our restructuring plans 
stock option valuation our estimate of compensation expense requires us to determine the appropriate fair value model and a number of complex and subjective assumptions including our stock price volatility  employee exercise patterns  future forfeitures and related tax effects 
the most significant assumptions are our estimates of the expected 
table of contents volatility and the expected term of the award 
we have limited historical information available to support the underlying estimates of certain assumptions required to value stock options 
the value of a stock option is derived from its potential for appreciation 
the more volatile the stock  the more valuable the option becomes because of the greater possibility of significant changes in stock price 
because there is a market for options on our common stock  we have considered implied volatilities as well as our historical realized volatilities when developing an estimate of expected volatility 
the expected option term also has a significant effect on the value of the option 
the longer the term  the more time the option holder has to allow the stock price to increase without a cash investment and thus  the more valuable the option 
further  lengthier option terms provide more opportunity to exploit market highs 
however  empirical data shows that employees  for a variety of reasons  typically do not wait until the end of the contractual term of a nontransferable option to exercise 
accordingly  companies are required to estimate the expected term of the option for input to an option pricing model 
as required under the accounting rules  we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and  as a result  from time to time we will likely change the valuation assumptions we use to value stock based awards granted in future periods 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
as of december   million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options was expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years in addition to million of total unrecognized compensation expense relating to restricted stock units  which was expected to be recognized over years 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on stock based compensation

results of operations comparison of years ended december   and revenues total revenues by category  as compared to the prior year  were as follows dollar amounts are presented in millions year ended december  contract revenues research and development funding milestones collaboration reimbursements other contract revenue license revenues and amortization of upfront payments total revenues dollar increase percentage increase 
table of contents total revenues by customer  as compared to the prior year  were as follows dollar amounts are presented in millions year ended december  bristol myers squibb sanofi genentech merck glaxosmithkline daiichi sankyo boehringer ingelheim all other revenue sources total revenues dollar increase percentage increase the increase in revenues from to was primarily due to the acceleration of million in license revenue as a result of the conclusion of our agreement with bristol myers squibb which effectively terminated on october  additionally  our revenues were increased due to the acceleration of million in license revenue and a one time termination fee received in january in the amount of million as a result of the wind down of our agreement with sanofi which effectively terminated on december  these increases were partially offset by a decline in collaboration reimbursement revenue and research funding related to the termination of our agreement with bristol myers squibb and the transfer of substantially all development activities pertaining to xl and xl to sanofi under license agreement for these compounds 
furthermore  there was a decline in milestone revenue relating to the one time payment received from genentech of million in under a collaboration agreement for therapeutics directed against targets in the notch signaling pathway compared to million received from genentech in under our mek collaboration 
the increase in revenues from to was primarily due to our collaboration agreements with sanofi for xl  xl and the discovery of inhibitors of pik 
in addition to the increase resulting from our collaboration agreements with sanofi  we also recognized increases in revenues of million due to increased collaboration cost sharing reimbursements relating to our cancer collaboration agreement with bristol myers squibb for cabozantinib and xl these increases in revenues were partially offset by a reduction in license revenues relating to our collaboration with boehringer ingelheim and our amended cancer collaboration with bristol myers squibb  as well as the conclusion of our mek collaboration with genentech 
in addition  we had a decline in milestone and contract revenues related to our cancer collaboration with bristol myers squibb and the completion of revenue recognition under our lxr collaboration with bristol myers squibb 
research and development expenses total research and development expenses  as compared to the prior year  were as follows dollar amounts are presented in millions year ended december  research and development expenses dollar decrease percentage decrease 
table of contents research and development expenses consist primarily of clinical trial expenses  personnel expenses  consulting expenses  laboratory supplies  general corporate costs  stock based compensation and depreciation 
the decrease in compared to  resulted primarily from the following personnel personnel expense  which includes salaries  bonuses  related fringe benefits  recruiting and relocation costs  decreased by million  or primarily due to the reduction in headcount resulting from our and restructuring plans 
clinical trial costs clinical trial expenses  which include services performed by third party contract research organizations and other vendors  decreased by million  or  primarily due to the transfer of xl and xl to sanofi  the wind down of activities associated with xl and the decrease in patient activity for xl trials 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in clinical trial activities for cabozantinib 
general corporate costs there was a decrease of million  or  in the allocation of general corporate costs such as facility costs  property taxes and insurance to research and development  primarily as a result of a decrease in personnel and the exit of facilities in san diego and south san francisco  as a result of our and restructuring plans  and the resulting decrease in costs to be allocated 
laboratory supplies laboratory supplies decreased by million  or  primarily due to the decrease in headcount and other cost cutting measures as a result of our and restructuring plans 
stock based compensation stock based compensation expense decreased by million  or  as a result of our reduction in headcount from our and restructuring plans 
the decrease in compared to resulted primarily from the following personnel personnel expense  which includes salaries  bonuses  related fringe benefits  recruiting and relocation costs  decreased by million  or  primarily due to a reduction in headcount resulting from our march restructuring plan 
general corporate costs there was a decrease of million  or  in the allocation of general corporate costs such as facility costs  property taxes and insurance to research and development  primarily as a result of a decrease in personnel and the exit of facilities in san diego and south san francisco  as a result of our march restructuring plan  and the resulting decrease in costs to be allocated 
laboratory supplies laboratory supplies decreased by million  or  primarily due to the decrease in headcount and other cost cutting measures as a result of our march restructuring plan 
stock based compensation stock based compensation expense decreased by million  or  as a result of our reduction in headcount from our march restructuring plan 
the decrese in compared to were partially offset by an increase in clinical trial expenses and a decline in cost reimbursements 
clinical trial expenses  which include services performed by third party contract research organizations and other vendors  increased by million  or  primarily due to increased phase and phase clinical trial activity for cabozantinib and increased phase clinical trial activity for xl these increases were partially offset by reduced activities associated with sei related compounds  for which the arrangement ended in  as well as a decline in activities associated with various other compounds 
in addition  an increase in research and development funding of million was recognized as a reduction to research and development expenses in  which primarily related to our contract research agreement with agrigenetics  inc  or agrigenetics  which ended in the research and development funding  which stems from our agreement with a third party relating to the sale of our cell factory business  ended in the second quarter of 
table of contents we do not track total research and development expenses separately for each of our research and development programs

our drug discovery group utilizes a variety of high throughput technologies to enable the rapid discovery  optimization and extensive characterization of lead compounds such that we are able to select development candidates with the best potential for further evaluation and advancement into clinical development 
drug discovery expenses relate primarily to personnel expense  lab supplies and general corporate costs 
our development group leads the development and implementation of our clinical and regulatory strategies and prioritizes disease indications in which our compounds may be studied in clinical trials 
development expenses relate primarily to clinical trial  personnel and general corporate costs 
the other category primarily includes stock based compensation expense 
in addition to reviewing the three categories of research and development expenses described above  we principally consider qualitative factors in making decisions regarding our research and development programs 
such factors include enrollment in clinical trials for our drug candidates  the results of and data from clinical trials  the potential indications for our drug candidates  the therapeutic and commercial potential for our drug candidates and competitive dynamics 
we also make our research and development decisions in the context of our overall business strategy  which historically included the pursuit of commercial collaborations with major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for the development of our drug candidates 
as noted under overview  we are focusing our proprietary resources and development efforts exclusively on cabozantinib in order to maximize the therapeutic and commercial potential of this compound 
our strategy is to aggressively advance cabozantinib through development toward commercialization  and as a result  we expect nearly all of our future research and development expenses to relate to the clinical development of cabozantinib 
the expenditures summarized in the following table reflect total research and development expenses by category  including allocations for general and administrative expense dollar amounts are presented in millions inception to date drug discovery development other total inception is as of january   the date on which we began tracking research and development expenses by category 
while we do not track total research and development expenses separately for each program  beginning in fiscal  we began tracking third party expenditures directly relating to each program as a way of monitoring external costs 
our third party research and development expenditures relate principally to our clinical trial and related development activities  such as preclinical and clinical studies and contract manufacturing  and represent only a portion of the costs related to each program 
third party expenditures for programs initiated prior to the beginning of fiscal have not been tracked from project inception  and therefore these expenditures from the actual inception for most of our programs are not available 
we do not accumulate on a program specific basis internal research and development expenses  such as salaries and personnel expenses  facilities overhead expenses and external costs not directly attributable to a specific project 
nevertheless  we believe that third party expenditures by program provide a reasonable estimate of the percentage of our total research and development expenses that are attributable to each such program 
under our current strategy  we are focusing our proprietary resources and development efforts exclusively on the late stage development and commercialization of cabozantinib 
as a result  for fiscal year  approximately of our external third party research and development expenditures were spent on this program 
the expenses for the cabozantinib program were primarily included in the development category of our research and development expenses and exclude the impact of any amounts reimbursed by our partners 

table of contents we do not have reliable estimates regarding the timing of our clinical trials 
we estimate that typical phase clinical trials last approximately one year  phase clinical trials last approximately one to two years and phase clinical trials last approximately two to four years 
however  the length of time may vary substantially according to factors relating to the particular clinical trial  such as the type and intended use of the drug candidate  the clinical trial design and the ability to enroll suitable patients 
in general  we will incur increased research and development expenses for compounds that advance in clinical development  whereas expenses will end for compounds that do not warrant further clinical development 
we do not have reliable estimates of total costs for a particular drug candidate to reach the market 
our potential therapeutic products are subject to a lengthy and uncertain regulatory process that may involve unanticipated additional clinical trials and may not result in receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals 
failure to receive the necessary regulatory approvals would prevent us from commercializing the product candidates affected 
in addition  clinical trials of our potential products may fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy  which could prevent or significantly delay regulatory approval 
general and administrative expenses total general and administrative expenses were as follows dollar amounts are presented in millions year ended december  general and administrative expenses dollar increase decrease percentage increase decrease general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses  employee stock based compensation expense  facility costs  legal patent costs and consulting and professional expenses  such as legal and accounting fees 
the increase in general and administrative expenses for as compared to  was primarily due to a decrease in allocation of general corporate costs to research and development as a result of the reduction in research and development headcount headcount from our and restructuring plans  as well as an increase in marketing expenses relating to the preparation for a potential commercial launch of cabozantinib 
these increases were offset by a decrease in facility  personnel and stock compensation costs relating to our and restructuring plans 
the decrease in from was primarily due to decreased personnel and facility costs related to our march restructuring  partially offset by a change in the allocation of overhead expenses as a result of our march restructuring in addition to a slight increase in patent costs 
collaboration reimbursement revenues cost sharing expenses total collaboration reimbursement revenues cost sharing expenses were as follows dollar amounts are presented in millions year ended december  collaboration reimbursements cost sharing expenses dollar increase decrease percentage increase decrease not meaningful not meaningful 
table of contents in and we had net collaboration reimbursements and recorded collaboration reimbursement revenue  and therefore no collaboration cost sharing expenses during these years 
collaboration reimbursement revenues cost sharing expenses consist of research and development expenses and reimbursements related to our cancer collaboration agreement with bristol myers squibb for cabozantinib and xl for the year ended december   when net research and development expenses were payable to bristol myers squibb  these payments were presented as collaboration cost sharing expenses resulting in operating expenses of million 
for the year ended december   we received net collaboration reimbursements and recorded collaboration reimbursement revenues of million  which included the million transition payment received from bristol myers squibb upon termination of our cancer collaboration with respect to cabozantinib only 
for the year ended december   the million of collaboration reimbursement revenues related to the reimbursement of costs for xl expenses only 
as a result of the termination of the agreement with bristol myers squibb with respect to xl  which became effective on october   we do not expect to record any further collaboration cost sharing expense or collaboration reimbursement revenues under any of our current collaborations 
restructuring charge total restructuring charge expenses from restructurings plans were as follows dollar amounts are presented in millions year ended december  restructuring charge dollar increase decrease percentage increase decrease not meaningful not meaningful as part of our ongoing efforts to manage costs and our strategy to focus our proprietary resources and development efforts on cabozantinib  we implemented two restructuring plans during that resulted in an overall reduction of our workforce by employees 
in march  we implemented an additional restructuring plan that resulted in further terminations in taking into consideration employees who have since been recalled  there has been an aggregate reduction in headcount from the and restructuring plans of employees 
the restructuring charge taken in primarily related to termination benefits for the reduction in headcount in march  in addition to facility charges relating to the exit and sublease of a building  while the restructuring charge taken in related primarily to facility charges associated with the exit and sublease of portions of another building 
as a result of our and restructuring plans  we expect to incur additional restructuring charges  primarily related to facility costs  through the end of total other income expense  net total other income expense  net  as compared to prior years was as follows dollar amounts are presented in millions year ended december  interest income and other  net interest expense gain on sale of businesses loss on deconsolidation of symphony evolution  inc total other income expense  net dollar increase decrease 
table of contents total other income expense  net consists primarily of interest income earned on our marketable securities and gains on sales of businesses  offset by interest expense incurred on our notes payable  bank obligations  capital lease obligations  convertible notes and loans and our credit facility 
the change in total other income expense  net for compared to  was primarily due to the increased interest expense in as a result of our entry into a note purchase agreement with deerfield in june  partially offset by gains relating to the sale of our remaining equity interest in artemis and the sale of excess xl materials 
in addition  in  we recorded gains relating to the sale of our plant trait business and the sale of our cell factory business 
the change in total other income expense  net for compared to  resulted primarily from the recording of a million loss upon deconsolidation of sei as a result of the expiration of our purchase option for sei in june as well as an million gain in relating to the sale of our plant trait business and our cell factory business 
in addition  interest expense declined with the termination of our facility agreement with deerfield in november and the payment of million in cash to glaxosmithkline in october as the second of three installments of principal and accrued interest due under our loan agreement with glaxosmithkline 
this was partially offset by increased interest expense incurred in connection with the new deerfield facility entered into in june income tax provision benefit year ended december  tax provision benefit dollar change percentage change not meaningful not meaningful not meaningful in and  we recorded an income tax benefit as a result of the enactment of the housing and economy recovery act of  which was extended through in connection with the enactment of the american recovery and reinvestment tax act of approximately million of the provision relates to an adjustment of the refund received in and under these acts after we further evaluated the qualified expenses from which the refund calculation was originally based 
the remaining amount of million relates to a tax deferred revenue adjustment that resulted in a state tax liability due to state net operating loss carryover limitations 
loss attributed to noncontrolling interest in  we licensed three of our compounds  xl  xl and xl  to sei in return for an million investment for the clinical development of these compounds 
as part of the agreement  we received an exclusive purchase option to acquire all of the equity of sei  thereby allowing us to reacquire xl  xl and xl at our sole discretion 
the purchase option expired on june  the expiration of the purchase option triggered a reconsideration event regarding our need to consolidate sei  a variable interest entity 
upon the expiration of the purchase option  we no longer held a variable interest in the variable interest entity 
accordingly  we deconsolidated sei and derecognized the sei assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interest from our financial statements 
for the year ended december   the losses attributed to the noncontrolling interest holders was million 
as a result of the deconsolidation  we will no longer record any further gains or losses attributable to sei 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash the following table summarizes our cash flow activities for the years ended december   and dollar amounts are presented in thousands year ended december  consolidated net income loss adjustments to reconcile net income loss to net cash used in operating activities changes in operating assets and liabilities net cash used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents  at beginning of year cash and cash equivalents  at end of year to date  we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity  payments and loans from collaborators and banks  debt financing arrangements and equipment financing facilities 
we have also financed certain of our research and development activities under our agreements with various collaborators 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and long term investments  which included restricted cash and investments of million and approximately million of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities that we are required to maintain on deposit with silicon valley bank or one of its affiliates pursuant to covenants in our loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank 
operating activities our operating activities used cash of million for the year ended december   compared to cash used of million for the year ended december  and cash used of million for the year ended december  the increase in cash used by operating activities for related primarily to a reduction of million in our deferred revenue balance due to the acceleration of non cash revenue recognized as well as a reduction in collaboration reimbursements and research funding received due to the termination of the agreement with bristol myers squibb and our collaboration agreement with sanofi 
in addition  there was an increase in our receivables balance relating to our collaboration agreements and a reduction in our other accrual balances due to the timing of payments made to vendors 
these increases in cash used were partially offset by our consolidated net income of million in addition to million in non cash charges relating to stock based compensation  depreciation and amortization  accretion of implied interest under our note purchase agreement with deerfield  impairment of assets due to our and restructuring plans  and other non cash changes 
our operating activities used cash of million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   and million for cash used in operating activities during related primarily to our consolidated net loss of million  to decreases in deferred revenues of million  to declines in accounts payable and other accrued expenses and gains recognized in association with our transaction with agrigenetics and for the sale of our plant trait business 
these uses of cash were partially offset by non cash charges totaling million relating to stock based compensation  depreciation and 
table of contents amortization  accretion of implied interest under our note purchase agreement with deerfield  and impairment of assets due to our march and december restructuring plans 
in addition  we recognized a restructuring liability of million primarily relating to the exit from one of our south san francisco buildings in connection with our march restructuring plan and termination benefits from our december restructuring plan  in addition to a decrease in other receivables 
cash used in operating activities during related primarily to our consolidated net loss of million offset by increases in deferred revenues and other non cash charges 
the decrease in our consolidated net loss was driven by an increase in revenues primarily due to our collaboration with sanofi relating to xl and xl and our cancer collaboration with bristol myers squibb relating to cabozantinib and xl  in addition to an overall decrease in operating expenses 
these uses of cash were primarily offset by a net increase in deferred revenue of million  primarily driven by receipt of an upfront cash payment of million related to the global license agreement and collaboration with sanofi  partially offset by a decrease in deferred revenue from the ratable recognition of deferred revenues over the period of continuing involvement from our various collaborations 
in addition  cash uses were offset by non cash charges totaling million relating to stock based compensation  depreciation and amortization  and a million loss that we recorded upon deconsolidation of sei 
prior to  we have been in a net loss position and our cash used in operating activities has been primarily driven by our consolidated net loss 
operating cash flows can differ from our consolidated net loss as a result of differences in the timing of cash receipts and earnings recognition and non cash charges 
going forward for at least the next several years  we expect to continue to use cash for operating activities as we incur net losses associated with our research and development activities  primarily with respect to manufacturing and development expenses for cabozantinib 
investing activities our investing activities used cash of million for the year ended december   compared to cash used of million for the year ended december   and cash provided of million for cash used by investing activities for was primarily driven by the purchase of million in marketable securities partially offset by proceeds received from the maturity of marketable securities of million  proceeds from the sale of marketable securities before maturity of million and a proceeds of million from the sale of our equity ownership in artemis 
cash used by investing activities for was primarily driven by the purchase of million of marketable securities and certificates of deposit 
these uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from the maturity of marketable securities of million in addition to the sale of investments prior to maturity of million and proceeds of million associated with our transaction with agrigenetics and the sale of our cell factory business in the proceeds provided by the sale and maturity of our investments were used to fund our operations 
additionally  in line with our focus on managing our cash resources  purchase of property and equipment were significantly lower in and than compared to prior years 
cash used in investing activities for was primarily driven by purchases of marketable securities of million 
most of the cash invested in marketable securities was generated by payments received from collaborators 
these uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from maturities of marketable securities and on sales of investments held by sei  for a combined cash inflow of million used to fund our operations 
financing activities our financing activities provided cash of million for the year ended december   compared to cash provided of million for the year ended december   and cash used of million for 
table of contents cash provided by our financing activities for consisted of net proceeds of million from the issuance of million shares of common stock  proceeds from the exercise of stock options of million and the final draw down of million required under our silicon valley bank loan agreement 
these increases in cash were partially offset by cash used for principal payments on notes payable and bank obligations of million 
cash provided by our financing activities for was primarily due to funds received under our loan agreement with silicon valley bank  the sale of secured convertible notes to deerfield for proceeds of million  proceeds from the sale of exelixis stock under our employee stock purchase plan of million and proceeds from employee option exercises of million 
these cash inflows were partially offset by principal payments on notes payable and bank obligations of million 
cash used by our financing activities for was primarily due to principal payments on notes payable and bank obligations of million partially offset by proceeds from notes payable and bank obligations of million and proceeds from employee stock purchase plan purchases of million 
proceeds from collaboration loans and common stock issuances are used for general working capital purposes  such as research and development activities and other general corporate purposes 
over the next several years  we are required to make certain payments on notes and bank obligations 
in june  we entered into the facility agreement with deerfield for which deerfield agreed to loan us up to million  subject to specified conditions 
the facility agreement was terminated in november  resulting in a million charge to interest expense relating to a cancellation fee and outstanding warrants 
we did not draw on the facility agreement at any time prior to its termination 
in  we amended our loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank to provide for a new seven year term loan in the amount of million 
in addition  we entered into a note purchase agreement with deerfield pursuant to which we sold to deerfield an aggregate million initial principal amount of our secured convertible notes for an aggregate purchase price of million  less closing fees and expenses of approximately million 
see note for additional details on these agreements 
cash requirements we have incurred net losses since inception 
however  for the year ended december   we were in a net income position of million  primarily as a result of the acceleration of revenue recognized under our collaboration agreement with bristol myers squibb that terminated in october and under our discovery collaboration agreement with sanofi that terminated in december notwithstanding our net income position for the year ended december   we anticipate further net losses and negative operating cash flow for the foreseeable future 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and long term investments  which included restricted cash and investments of million and approximately million of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities that we are required to maintain on deposit with silicon valley bank or one of its affiliates pursuant to covenants in our loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank 
in february  we raised approximately million in net proceeds from a public offering of our common stock 
we anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  long term investments and funding that we expect to receive from existing collaborators  together with the anticipated proceeds from this offering  will enable us to maintain our operations for a period of at least months following the filing date of this report 
however  our future capital requirements will be substantial and will depend on many factors that may require us to use available capital resources significantly earlier than we currently anticipate 
these factors include the cabozantinib development program we are focusing our proprietary resources and development efforts on cabozantinib  our most advanced product candidate  which is being studied in a variety of tumor types  with the goal of rapidly commercializing the compound 
cabozantinib is being evaluated in a broad development program encompassing multiple cancer indications 
the current clinical 
table of contents program for cabozantinib is focused on the treatment of metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer and medullary thyroid cancer and will be expanded to other solid tumor indications  based on encouraging interim data that have emerged from the rdt investigating cabozantinib in nine distinct tumor types and other clinical trials 
in october  we announced that our phase clinical trial of cabozantinib in medullary thyroid cancer met its primary endpoint  and  in december  the fda granted us permission to initiate a rolling submission of an nda for cabozantinib in medullary thyroid cancer 
we initiated the submission in december by submitting to the fda key parts of the nda  including the preclinical information  and we expect to complete the nda filing in the first half of assuming priority review and approval of our nda by the fda  we currently anticipate a potential commercial launch of cabozantinib for the treatment of medullary thyroid cancer in the second half of in december  we initiated our first phase pivotal trial of cabozantinib in patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer using an endpoint of pain reduction comet 
we also plan to initiate a phase pivotal trial in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer patients with an overall survival endpoint comet in the first half of as part of our comprehensive development plan for cabozantinib in castration resistant prostate cancer 
we are also planning other potential pivotal trials in prostate cancer 
our development and commercialization plans for cabozantinib are dependent on the extent of our available financial resources 
there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources independently or through other arrangements to fund the trials that are currently planned or in process  to fund other clinical trials that we may desire to initiate in the future or to fund commercialization efforts 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  discontinue or elect not to pursue one or more trials or commercialization efforts for cabozantinib  repayment of the notes under our note purchase agreement with deerfield on june   we entered into a note purchase agreement with deerfield pursuant to which  on july   we sold to deerfield an aggregate of million initial principal amount of our secured convertible notes  due june  for an aggregate purchase price of million  less closing fees and expenses 
the outstanding principal amount of the notes bears interest in the annual amount of million  payable quarterly in arrears 
we will be required to make mandatory prepayments on the notes on an annual basis in  and equal to of specified payments from our collaborative arrangements received during the prior fiscal year  subject to a maximum annual prepayment amount of million and  for payments due in january and  a minimum prepayment amount of million 
we may also prepay all or a portion not less than million of the principal amount of the notes at an optional prepayment price based on a discounted principal amount during the first three years of the term  subject to a prepayment premium determined as of the date of prepayment  plus accrued and unpaid interest  plus in the case of a prepayment of the full principal amount of the notes other than prepayments upon the occurrence of specified transactions relating to a change of control or a substantial sale of assets  all accrued interest that would have accrued between the date of such prepayment and the next anniversary of the note purchase agreement 
in lieu of making any optional or mandatory prepayment in cash  subject to specified limitations  we have the right to convert all or a portion of the principal amount of the notes into  or satisfy all or any portion of the optional prepayment amounts or mandatory prepayment amounts other than the first million of mandatory prepayments required in and with  shares of our common stock 
additionally  in lieu of making any payment of accrued and unpaid interest in respect of the notes in cash  subject to specified limitations  we may elect to satisfy any such payment with shares of our common stock 
the number of shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion or in settlement of principal and interest obligations will be based upon the discounted trading price of our common stock over a specified trading period 
in the event the market price for our common stock is depressed or we do not have sufficient number of authorized but unissued shares  we may not be able to convert the principal amount of the notes or satisfy our payment obligations in full using shares of our common stock due to restrictions in the agreement on the number of shares we may issue 
in addition  the issuance of shares of our common stock to convert the notes or satisfy our payment obligations may result in significant 
table of contents dilution to our stockholders 
as a result  we may need to obtain additional funding to satisfy our repayment obligations 
there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient funds to repay the notes or satisfy our payment obligations under the note purchase agreement when due or that we will comply with the conditions to our ability to convert the principal amount of the notes into or satisfy our payment obligations with shares of our common stock  repayment of our loan from silicon valley bank on june   we amended our loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank to provide for a new seven year term loan in an amount of million 
the principal amount outstanding under the term loan accrues interest at per annum  which interest is due and payable monthly 
we are required to repay the term loan in one balloon principal payment  representing of the principal balance and accrued and unpaid interest  on may  we have the option to prepay all  but not less than all  of the amounts advanced under the term loan  provided that we pay all unpaid accrued interest thereon that is due through the date of such prepayment and the interest on the entire principal balance of the term loan that would otherwise have been paid after such prepayment date until the maturity date of the term loan 
in accordance with the terms of the loan and security agreement  we are also required to maintain on deposit an amount equal to at least of the outstanding principal balance of the term loan at all times as support for our obligations under the loan and security agreement 
as a result  the proceeds of the term loan cannot be used to satisfy our other obligations without causing a default under our loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank  the level of payments received under existing collaboration agreements  licensing agreements and other arrangements  the degree to which we conduct funded development activity on behalf of partners to whom we have out licensed compounds  whether we enter into new collaboration agreements  licensing agreements or other arrangements including  in particular  with respect to cabozantinib that provide additional capital  our ability to control costs  our ability to remain in compliance with  or amend or cause to be waived  financial covenants contained in agreements with third parties  the amount of our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities that serve as collateral for bank lines of credit  future clinical trial results  our need to expand our product and clinical development efforts  our ability to share the costs of our clinical development efforts with third parties  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the cost of clinical and research supplies of our product candidates  the effect of competing technological and market developments  the filing  maintenance  prosecution  defense and enforcement of patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and the cost of any acquisitions of or investments in businesses  products and technologies 
we may seek to raise funds through the sale of equity or debt securities or through external borrowings 
in addition  we may enter into additional strategic partnerships  collaborative arrangements or other strategic transactions 
it is unclear whether any such partnership  arrangement or transaction will occur  on satisfactory terms or at all  or what the timing and nature of such a partnership  arrangement or transaction may be 
the sale of equity or convertible debt securities in the future may be dilutive to our stockholders  and debt financing 
table of contents arrangements may require us to pledge certain assets and enter into covenants that would restrict certain business activities or our ability to incur further indebtedness  and may contain other terms that are not favorable to our stockholders or us 
if we are unable to obtain adequate funds on reasonable terms  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or obtain funds by entering into financing  supply or collaboration agreements on unattractive terms or we may be required to relinquish rights to technology or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that are unfavorable to us 
we may need to obtain additional funding in order to stay in compliance with financial covenants contained in agreements with third parties 
as described below  the terms of our debt owed to deerfield and silicon valley bank each contain covenants requiring us to maintain specified cash balances or levels of working capital deerfield our note purchase agreement with deerfield contains an event of default that would be triggered if our cash and cash equivalents fall below million as of december   subject to a cure period 
upon such an event of default  deerfield may declare all or a portion of the put price to be immediately due and payable 
cash and cash equivalents for purposes of our note purchase agreement includes our total cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term marketable securities 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents were million 
silicon valley bank our loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank requires that we maintain an amount equal to at least  but not to exceed  of the outstanding principal balance of the term loan and all equipment lines of credit under the loan and security agreement at all times in one or more investment accounts with silicon valley bank or one of its affiliates as support for our obligations under the loan and security agreement 
if the balance on our deposit account s falls below the required level for more than days  silicon valley bank may declare all or part of the obligations under the loan and security agreement to be immediately due and payable and stop advancing money or extending credit to us 
if we cannot raise additional capital in order to remain in compliance with our financial covenants or if we are unable to renegotiate such covenants and the lender exercises its remedies under the agreement  we would not be able to operate under our current operating plan 
we have contractual obligations in the form of operating leases  notes payable and licensing agreements 
the following chart details our contractual obligations  including any potential accrued or accreted interest  as of december  dollar amounts are presented in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years notes payable and bank obligations convertible loans operating leases total contractual cash obligations see note to the notes to our consolidated financial statements regarding the terms of the deerfield financing 
the operating lease payments are net of million to be received through in connection with our sublease for two of our south san francisco buildings 
in connection with the sale of our plant trait business  we agreed to indemnify the purchaser and its affiliates up to a specified amount if they incur damages due to any infringement or alleged infringement of certain patents 
we have certain collaboration licensing agreements  which contain standard indemnification clauses 
such clauses typically indemnify the customer or vendor for an adverse judgment in a lawsuit in the event of our misuse or negligence 
we consider the likelihood of an adverse judgment related to an indemnification 
table of contents agreement to be remote 
furthermore  in the event of an adverse judgment  any losses under such an adverse judgment may be substantially offset by corporate insurance 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued asu no 
 revenue recognition multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu 
asu provides application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the deliverables should be separated and how the consideration should be allocated to one or more units of accounting 
this update establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
the selling price used for each deliverable will be based on vendor specific objective evidence  if available  third party evidence if vendor specific objective evidence is not available  or estimated selling price if neither vendor specific or third party evidence is available 
under asu  we may be required to exercise considerable judgment in determining the estimated selling price of delivered items under new agreements and our revenue under new agreements may be more accelerated as compared to the prior accounting standard 
we adopted this guidance beginning january  while it has not had a material impact on our financial statements in  we expect that this adoption could have a material impact on our financial statements going forward 
in june  accounting standards codification topic  comprehensive income was amended to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income 
accordingly  a company can present all non owner changes in stockholders equity either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
we adopted this guidance in on a retrospective basis and have determined that it did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any material off balance sheet arrangements  as defined by applicable sec regulations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long term debt 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  long term investments and restricted cash and investments of million 
our marketable securities and our investments are subject to interest rate risk  and our interest income may fluctuate due to changes in us interest rates 
we manage market risk through diversification requirements mandated by our investment policy  which limits the amount of our portfolio that can be invested in a single issuer 
we limit our credit risk by limiting purchases to high quality issuers 
at december  and  we had debt outstanding of million and million  respectively 
our payment commitments associated with these debt instruments are primarily fixed and are comprised of interest payments  principal payments  or a combination of both 
the fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates 
we have estimated the effects on our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities based on a one percentage point hypothetical adverse change in interest rates as of december  and december  as of december  and december   a decrease in the interest rates of one percentage point would have had a net adverse change in the fair value of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities of million and million  respectively 
in addition  we have exposure to fluctuations in certain foreign currencies in countries in which we conduct clinical trials 
most of our foreign expenses incurred are associated with establishing and conducting clinical trials for cabozantinib and various other compounds in our pipeline at sites outside of the united states 
our agreements with the foreign sites that conduct such clinical trials generally provide that payments for the services provided will be calculated in the currency of that country  and converted into us dollars using various exchange rates based upon when services are rendered or the timing of invoices 
when the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the us dollar value of the foreign currency denominated expense increases  and when the us dollar strengthens against these currencies  the us dollar value of the foreign currency denominated expense decreases 
as of december   approximately million of our clinical accrual balance was owed in foreign currencies 
as of december   an adverse change of one percentage point in the in foreign currency exchange rates would have resulted in a net loss of  as of december   an adverse change of one percentage point in the in foreign currency exchange rates would have resulted in a net loss of  we incurred a net loss of million relating to our foreign currency contract that was settled in december  but we have not incurred any gains or losses relating to foreign exchange fluctuations in relation to clinical trials for the fiscal year ended december  or december
