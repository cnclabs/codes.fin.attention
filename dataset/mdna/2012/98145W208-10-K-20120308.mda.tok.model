item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
you should review the risk factors section of this annual report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 
overview world energy offers a range of energy management solutions to commercial and industrial businesses  institutions  utilities  and governments to reduce their overall energy costs 
we come to market with a holistic approach to energy management helping customers a contract for the lowest price for energy  b engage in energy efficiency projects to minimize quantity used and c maximize available rebate and incentive programs 
we have primarily focused on our retail and wholesale energy procurement clients via our state of the art online auction platforms  the world energy exchange  the world green exchange and the world dr exchange 
with recent investments and acquisitions  we are building out our energy efficiency practice offering technology enabled solutions such as online audits of facilities to identify retrofit options and project management services for retrofit implementation  believing this practice will also enable more cross selling opportunities for commodity auctions 
we are also taking our suite of solutions to the rapidly growing small and medium sized customer marketplaces 
we provide energy management services utilizing state of the art technology and the experience of a seasoned management team to bring lower energy costs to its customers 
we use a simple equation e p q i to help customers to understand the holistic nature of the energy management problem 
total energy cost e is a function of energy price p times the quantity of energy consumed q  minus any rebates or incentives i the customer can earn 
this approach not only makes energy management more approachable for customers  simplifying what has become an increasingly dynamic and complex problem  it also highlights the inter related nature of the energy management challenge 
we assert that point solution vendors may optimize one of the three elements  but it takes looking at the problem holistically to unlock the most savings 
in april  we issued approximately million shares of common stock to several accredited institutional investors at per share  yielding net proceeds of approximately million 
we have used  and we anticipate that we will continue to use  this and future capital raises for strategic initiatives  including investments and acquisitions in the energy management space 
acquisitions acquisitions are an important component of our business strategy 
our focus is on both our core procurement business as well as new product lines within the energy management services industry such as energy efficiency services 
we account for acquisitions in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  business combinations 
during the third and fourth quarters of we acquired co exprise  inc co exprise  northeast energy solutions  llc nes and gse consulting  lp gse 
these acquisitions round out the company s capabilities in the energy efficiency arena  enable the company to enter the growing small and medium sized customer marketplaces  and consolidate the auction space 
in september  we acquired certain contracts owned by co exprise pursuant to a contract purchase agreement between the company and co exprise 
pursuant to this agreement  we purchased all of the contracts and assumed certain obligations with respect to co exprise s energy procurement business 
the purchase price was million in cash  subject to certain escrowing provisions 
on october   we acquired substantially all of the assets and certain obligations of nes pursuant to an asset purchase agreement between the company  nes  robert boissonneault  michael santangelo  and richard galipeau 
pursuant to this agreement  we purchased all of the assets and assumed certain obligations with respect to nes s business 
the maximum purchase price was  consisting of  in cash   paid in the form of a promissory note the promissory note  as amended   shares of our common stock paid to the sellers equal to approximately  plus up to an additional  in contingent consideration the contingent consideration 
the promissory note is payable in cash and the contingent consideration is payable  subject to certain conditions  in cash 
nes  located in cromwell connecticut  focuses on turn key electrical and mechanical energy efficiency measures serving commercial  industrial and institutional customers 

table of contents on october   we acquired substantially all of the assets and certain obligations of gse pursuant to an asset purchase agreement between the company  gse  glenwood energy partners  ltd 
and gulf states energy  inc gse is a texas based energy management and procurement company 
the purchase price was million at closing  consisting of million in cash  million in cash to pay off gse debt  and million shares of our common stock valued at million based on the nasdaq consolidated closing bid price on october  gse may earn up to an additional million of contingent consideration in cash based on the achievement of certain annualized new booking and renewal rate targets 
the maximum purchase price if gse achieves all of its contingent consideration targets is million 
with the acquisition of nes  we plan to manage the business as two business segments energy procurement and energy efficiency services 
our business model is heavily dependent on our people 
we have significantly grown our employee base from at our initial public offering ipo in november to a current high of at december  this planned investment has been and will continue to be a key component of our strategic initiatives and has resulted in revenue growth of over to million in since our initial public offering in while these infrastructure investments resulted in short term operating losses  they began to generate incremental revenue in the late and positive adjusted ebitda in ten of the last twelve quarters  including nine quarters in a row 
over these nine quarters we have generated positive adjusted ebitda of million  including million in we have been able to fund our most recent acquisitions with cash on hand and cash we have generated from operations and we will continue to focus on cash generating acquisitions in the future 
these activities  however  will increase our operating costs both in the short and long term and may require us to borrow against our current credit facility and or raise funds through additional capital raises 
operations revenue retail electricity transactions we earn a monthly commission on energy sales contracted through our online auction platform from each bidder or energy supplier based on the energy usage transacted between the bidder and lister or energy consumer 
our commissions are not based on the retail price for electricity  rather on the amount of energy consumed 
commissions are calculated based on the volume of energy usage transacted between the energy supplier and energy consumer multiplied by our contractual commission rate 
our contractual commission rate is negotiated with the energy consumer on a procurement by procurement basis based on energy consumer specific circumstances  including the size of auction  the effort required to organize and run the respective auction and competitive factors  among others 
once the contractual commission is agreed to with the energy consumer  all energy suppliers participating in the auction agree to that rate 
that commission rate remains fixed for the duration of the contractual term regardless of energy usage 
energy consumers provide us with a letter of authorization to request their usage history from the local utility 
we then use this data to compile a usage profile for that energy consumer that will become the basis for the auction 
this data may also be used to estimate revenue on a going forward basis  as noted below 
historically  our revenue and operating results have varied from quarter to quarter and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future 
these fluctuations are primarily due to the buying patterns of our wholesale and natural gas customers  which tend to have large  seasonal purchases during the fourth and first quarters and electricity usage having higher demand in our second and third quarters 
in addition  the activity levels on the world energy exchange can fluctuate due to a number of factors  including market prices  weather conditions  energy consumers credit ratings  the ability of suppliers to obtain financing in credit markets  and economic and geopolitical events 
to the extent these factors affect the purchasing decisions of energy consumers our future results of operations may be affected 
contracts between energy suppliers and energy consumers are signed for a variety of term lengths  with a one year contract term being typical for commercial and industrial energy consumers  and government contracts typically having two to three year terms 
our revenue has grown over the last three years through new participants utilizing our world energy exchange as well as existing energy consumers increasing the size or frequency of their transactions on our exchange platform 
we do not invoice our electricity energy suppliers for monthly commissions earned and  therefore  we report a substantial portion of our receivables as unbilled 
unbilled accounts receivable represents management s best estimate of energy provided by the energy suppliers to the energy consumers for a specific completed time period at contracted commission rates and is made up of two components 
the first component represents energy usage for which we have received actual data from the supplier and or the utility  but for which payment has not been received at the balance sheet date 
the majority of our contractual relationships with energy suppliers require them to supply actual usage data to us on a monthly basis and remit payment to us based on that usage 
the second component represents energy usage for which we have not received actual data  but for which we have estimated usage 
commissions paid in advance by certain bidders are recorded as deferred revenue and amortized to commission revenue on a monthly basis on the energy exchanged that month 
retail natural gas transactions there are two primary fee components to our retail natural gas services transaction fees and management fees 
transaction 
table of contents fees are billed to and paid by the energy supplier awarded business on the platform 
these fees are established prior to award and are the same for each supplier 
for the majority of our natural gas transactions  we bill the supplier upon the conclusion of the transaction based on the estimated energy volume transacted for the entire award term multiplied by the transaction fee 
management fees are paid by our energy consumers and are generally billed on a monthly basis for services rendered based on terms and conditions included in contractual arrangements 
while substantially all of our retail natural gas transactions are accounted for in accordance with this policy  a certain percentage is accounted for as the natural gas is consumed by the energy consumer and recognized as revenue in accordance with the retail electricity transaction revenue recognition methodology described above 
demand response transactions demand response transaction fees are recognized when we have received confirmation from the drp that the energy consumer has performed under the applicable rto or iso program requirements 
the energy consumer is either called to perform during an actual curtailment event or is required to demonstrate its ability to perform in a test event during the performance period 
for the pjm  an rto that coordinates the movement of wholesale electricity in all or parts of states and the district of columbia  the performance period is june through september in a calendar year 
test results are submitted to the pjm by the drps and we receive confirmation of the energy consumer s performance in the fourth quarter 
drps typically pay us ratably on a quarterly basis throughout the demand response fiscal june to may year 
as a result  a portion of the revenue we recognize is reflected as unbilled accounts receivable 
wholesale transactions wholesale transaction fees are invoiced upon the conclusion of the auction based on a fixed fee 
these revenues are not tied to future energy usage and are recognized upon the completion of the online auction 
for reverse auctions where our customers bid for a consumer s business  the fees are paid by the bidder 
for forward auctions where a lister is selling energy products  the fees are typically paid by the lister 
while substantially all wholesale transactions are accounted for in this fashion  a small percentage of our wholesale revenue is accounted for as electricity or gas is delivered  similar to the retail electricity transaction methodology described above 
environmental commodity transactions environmental commodity transaction fees are accounted for utilizing two primary methods 
for regulated allowance programs like rggi  fees are paid by the lister and are recognized quarterly as revenue as auctions are completed and approved 
for all other environmental commodity transactions both the lister and the bidder pay the transaction fee and revenue is recognized upon the consummation of the underlying transaction as credits are delivered by the lister and payment is made by the bidder 
energy efficiency services the company generally recognizes revenues for energy efficiency services when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
due to the short term nature of projects typically two to three weeks  the company utilizes the completed contract method 
revenues are recognized based upon factors such as passage of title  installation  payments and customer acceptance 
cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of salaries  employee benefits and share based compensation associated with our auction management services  which are directly related to the development and production of the online auction and maintenance of market related data on our auction platform and monthly management fees our supply desk function  amortization of capitalized costs associated with our auction platform and acquired developed technology  and rent  depreciation and other related overhead and facility related costs 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  employee benefits and share based compensation related to sales and marketing personnel  third party commission expenses to our channel partners  travel and related expenses  amortization related to customer relationships and contracts  
table of contents rent  depreciation and other related overhead and facility related costs  and general marketing costs such as trade shows  marketing materials and outsourced services 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  employee benefits and share based compensation related to general and administrative personnel  accounting  legal  and other professional fees  and rent  depreciation and other related overhead and facility related costs 
interest income expense  net interest income expense  net consists primarily of interest income earned on cash held in the bank and note receivable  and interest expense related to capital leases  note payable and contingent consideration 
income tax expense we recorded income tax expense of approximately  for the year ended december  we did not record an income tax benefit for the years ended december  and as we provided a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets due to uncertainty regarding the realization of those deferred tax assets  primarily net operating loss carryforwards  in the future 
the income tax expense in reflects an alternative minimum tax liability and certain state and local tax liabilities incurred in calendar results of operations the following table sets forth certain items as a percent of revenue for the periods presented for the years ended december  revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing general and administrative operating income loss interest income expense  net income tax expense net income loss comparison of the years ended december  and revenue for the years ended december  increase revenue revenue increased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  primarily due to increased auction activity in our retail product line and contributions from our recently completed acquisitions 
these increases were partially offset by declines in our wholesale and environmental commodities product lines 
the retail product line reflected new customer wins with a concentration in the pennsylvania electricity market  revenue related to an agreement with one of our energy suppliers for the payment of all future amounts due us subsequent to august  and further growth in our channel partner network 
our gas  wholesale and green product lines decreased primarily due to decreased activity and the timing of transactions compared to the same periods in our energy efficiency service segment generated  in revenue for there was no revenue from this segment in 
table of contents cost of revenue for the years ended december  of revenue of revenue increase cost of revenue cost of revenue increased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  as increases in payroll and commission costs were partially offset by a decrease in amortization of capitalized software 
payroll costs increased due to a net increase in supply desk employees in including the addition of employees from our recent acquisitions 
commission costs increased due to the increase in revenue 
our energy efficiency services segment incurred million of supply desk costs in including payroll and project materials 
this segment did not incur any cost of revenue in cost of revenue as a percent of revenue decreased due to the increase in revenue  which was substantially offset by the increase in costs 
operating expenses for the years ended december  of revenue of revenue increase sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses sales and marketing expenses increased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due to increases in third party commission costs  amortization of intangible assets and  to a lesser extent  payroll and internal commission costs

this segment did not incur any sales and marketing expense in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue decreased due to the increase in revenue substantially offset by the increase in costs 
the increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in was primarily due to million in costs directly related to acquisition related activities including audits  valuation service  legal  broker and travel costs  and an increase in payroll costs for personnel to support ongoing corporate activities 
general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue remained the same as as the increase in revenue offset the increase in costs 
interest income expense  net interest expense  net was approximately  for the year ended december  and interest income  net was approximately  for the year ended december  interest income increased approximately  in due to interest earned on a convertible note receivable with retroficiency 
interest expense increased approximately  primarily due to interest on the notes payable to nes and interest on the gse contingent consideration

the income tax expense in reflects an alternative minimum tax and state and local income tax liability anticipated to be incurred in calendar net income loss we reported net income for the year ended december  of approximately million as compared to a net loss of approximately million for the year ended december  the increase in net income in is primarily due to the increase in revenue partially offset by acquisition costs  increases in internal and third party commissions  increased amortization expense related to our acquisitions and costs incurred by our energy efficiency services segment and from our gse acquisition 
comparison of the years ended december  and revenue for the years ended december  increase revenue 
table of contents revenue increased primarily due to increased auction activity in our retail product line and  to a lesser extent  our wholesale product line 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in our environmental commodity product line 
the retail product line increase reflects new customer wins with a concentration in the ohio electricity market as price caps expired during the year opening up the territory to competitive supply  increased gas transaction activity and further growth in our channel partner network 
our environmental commodities product line decreased slightly as continued execution under our rggi contract was offset by a decline in transaction volume due to the uncertain regulatory environment 
cost of revenue for the years ended december  of revenue of revenue increase cost of revenue cost of revenue was relatively flat compared to the year ended december  as increases in commission costs were substantially offset by decreases in payroll and amortization of capitalized software 
commission costs increased due to the increase in revenue 
payroll costs decreased as we continued to leverage our process and technology to drive higher volumes over our exchanges 
cost of revenue as a percent of revenue decreased as revenue increased with no corresponding increase in costs 
operating expenses for the years ended december  of revenue of revenue increase decrease sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses the decrease in sales and marketing expense for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in primarily reflects general decreases in compensation and travel costs substantially offset by increases in marketing and internal and third party commission costs 
compensation and travel costs decreased primarily due to adjustments we made in our organizational structure during the third quarter of as we realigned our staffing as business and economic conditions evolved 
internal and third party commission costs increased due to the increase in revenue and marketing costs increased due to increased trade show and marketing activities 
sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue decreased primarily due to the increase in revenue and  to a lesser extent  the cost decreases noted above 
the increase in general and administrative expenses related to the year ended december  as compared to the same period in was primarily due to increases in compensation  investor relations and other costs 
compensation costs increased due to an increase in variable compensation resulting from our record performance  the reclassification of certain employees and the addition of certain staff in our accounting  information technology and human resources departments 
in addition  we increased our investor relations efforts in the us to capitalize on our nasdaq listing and increased our allowance for doubtful accounts 
general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue increased due to the cost increases noted above substantially offset by the increase in revenue 
interest income expense  net interest expense was approximately  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  interest income was approximately  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense is due to certain capital leases maturing during the year 
the increase in interest income was primarily due to interest accrued on a note receivable related to funding of an energy efficiency and management software and services company in income tax expense we did not record an income tax benefit for the years ended december  and as we provided a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets due to uncertainty regarding the realization of those deferred tax assets  primarily net operating loss carryforwards  in the future 
net loss we reported a net loss for the year ended december  of approximately million as compared to a net loss of approximately million for the year ended december  the decrease in net loss is primarily due to the increase in revenue partially offset by increases in internal and third party commissions as well as increased investor relations costs 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources at december   we had no commitments for material capital expenditures 
we have identified and executed against a number of strategic initiatives that we believe are key components of our future growth  including expanding our community of listers  bidders and channel partners on our exchanges  strengthening and extending our long term relationships with government agencies  entering into other energy related markets including wholesale transactions with utilities  energy efficiency  and demand response  making strategic acquisitions  and growing our direct and inside sales force 
through december  we funded our acquisitions through the use of cash on hand and cash generated from operations 
as part of the consideration for nes  we are committed to repay million in notes payable to the sellers plus interest in three equal installments on july  october and december   respectively 
in addition  we have a commitment to pay contingent consideration of million in the first quarters of and  respectively  if certain milestones and financial performance criteria are met 
during the first quarter of  we paid million to the sellers as the performance criteria of the first milestone was met 
as part of the consideration paid to the former owners of gse  we are required to pay up to a maximum of million of contingent consideration in each of the first quarters of  and based on certain performance criteria 
we made a million payment during the first quarter of as gse had met the performance criteria for the contingent consideration 
while we believe we have the resources to meet our long term obligations under these arrangements based on cash on hand and the operating cash flows both from our base and these recently acquired businesses  we entered into an amended million credit facility with silicon valley bank subsequent to year end to meet our short term requirements under these arrangements 
under the amended facility  we borrowed million under a year term note months interest only  equal installments of principal and interest and have million available under a line of credit 
we did not borrow against the line of credit 
we believe our resources are adequate to meet our continuing obligations under these arrangements 
all of our acquisitions have historically generated operating cash flow and we believe our cash flows will be adequate to meet the contingent consideration payments when due  if any  to meet our obligations under the term note  and to repay the notes payable to seller when due

accordingly  actual results could differ from these estimates 

table of contents the most judgmental estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements are those relating to revenue recognition and the estimate of actual energy delivered from the bidder to the lister of such energy  share based compensation  the valuation of intangible assets and goodwill  the valuation of contingent consideration  impairment of long lived assets  and estimates of future taxable income as it relates to the realization of our net deferred tax assets 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
to the extent actual results differ from those estimates  future results of operations may be affected 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
refer to note of our consolidated financial statements filed herewith for a description of our accounting policies 
revenue recognition retail electricity transactions we earn a monthly commission on energy sales contracted through its online auction platform from each bidder or energy supplier based on the energy usage transacted between the bidder and lister or energy consumer 
our commissions are not based on the retail price for electricity  rather on the amount of energy consumed 
commissions are calculated based on the energy usage transacted between the energy supplier and energy consumer multiplied by our contractual commission rate 
revenue from commissions is recognized as earned on a monthly basis over the life of each contract as energy is consumed  provided there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured  and customer acceptance criteria  if any  has been successfully demonstrated 
we record brokerage commissions based on actual usage data obtained from the energy supplier for that accounting period  or to the extent actual usage data is not available  based on the estimated amount of electricity and gas delivered to the energy consumers for that accounting period 
we develop our estimates on a quarterly basis based on the following criteria payments received prior to the issuance of the financial statements  usage updates from energy suppliers  usage data from utilities  comparable historical usage data  and historical variances to previous estimates 
to the extent usage data cannot be obtained  we estimate revenue as follows historical usage data obtained from the energy consumer in conjunction with the execution of the auction  geographic utility usage patterns based on actual data received  analysis of prior year usage patterns  and specific review of individual energy supplier location accounts 
in addition  we analyze this estimated data based on overall industry trends including prevailing weather and usage data 
once the actual data is received  we adjust the estimated accounts receivable and revenue to the actual total amount in the period during which the payment is received 
based on management s current capacity to obtain actual energy usage  we currently estimate four to six weeks of revenue at the end of its accounting period 
differences between estimated and actual revenue have been within management s expectations and have not been material to date 
we also recognize revenue from certain mid market transactions as cash is received from the energy supplier 
we do not invoice our electricity energy suppliers for monthly commissions earned and  therefore  we report a substantial portion of our receivables as unbilled 
unbilled accounts receivable represents management s best estimate of energy provided by the energy suppliers to the energy consumers for a specific completed time period at contracted commission rates and is made up of two components 
the first component represents energy usage for which we have received actual data from the supplier and or the utility but for which payment has not been received at the balance sheet date 
the majority of our contractual relationships with energy suppliers require them to supply actual usage data to us on a monthly basis and remit payment to us based on that usage 
the second component represents energy usage for which we have not received actual data  but for which we have estimated usage 
commissions paid in advance by certain energy suppliers are recorded as deferred revenue and amortized to commission revenue on a monthly basis on the energy exchanged that month 
retail natural gas transactions there are two primary fee components to our retail natural gas services transaction fees and management fees 
transaction fees are billed to and paid by the energy supplier awarded business on the platform 
these fees are established prior to award and are the same for each supplier 
for the majority of our natural gas transactions  the supplier is billed upon the conclusion of the transaction based on the estimated energy volume transacted for the entire award term multiplied by the transaction fee 
management fees are paid by our energy consumers and are generally billed on a monthly basis for services rendered based on terms and conditions included in contractual arrangements 
while substantially all of our retail natural gas transactions are 
table of contents accounted for in accordance with this policy  a certain percentage are accounted for as the natural gas is consumed by the customer and recognized as revenue in accordance with the retail electricity transaction revenue recognition methodology described above 
demand response transactions demand response transaction fees are recognized when we receive confirmation from the csp that the energy consumer has performed under the applicable rto or iso program requirements 
the energy consumer is either called to perform during an actual curtailment event or is required to demonstrate its ability to perform in a test event during the performance period 
for pjm the performance period is june through september in a calendar year 
test results are submitted to pjm by the csps and we receive confirmation of the energy consumer s performance in the fourth quarter 
csps typically pay us ratably on a quarterly basis throughout the demand response fiscal june to may year 
as a result  a portion of the revenue we recognize is reflected as unbilled accounts receivable 
wholesale transactions wholesale transaction fees are invoiced upon the conclusion of the auction based on a fixed fee 
these revenues are not tied to future energy usage and are recognized upon the completion of the online auction 
for reverse auctions where our customers bid for a consumer s business  the fees are paid by the bidder 
for forward auctions where a lister is selling energy products  the fees are typically paid by the lister 
while substantially all wholesale transactions are accounted for in this fashion  a small percentage of our wholesale revenue is accounted for as electricity or gas is delivered  similar to the retail electricity transaction methodology described above 
environmental commodity transactions environmental commodity transaction fees are accounted for utilizing two primary methods 
for regulated allowance programs like rggi  fees are paid by the lister and are recognized as revenue quarterly as auctions are completed and approved 
for most other environmental commodity transactions both the lister and the bidder pay the transaction fee and revenue is recognized upon the consummation of the underlying transaction as credits are delivered by the lister and payment is made by the bidder 
channel partner commissions we pay commissions to our channel partners at contractual rates based on monthly energy transactions between energy suppliers and energy consumers 
the commission is accrued monthly and charged to sales and marketing expense as revenue is recognized 
we pay commissions to our salespeople at contractual commission rates based upon cash collections from our customers 
revenue estimation our estimates in relation to revenue recognition affect revenue and sales and marketing expense as reflected on our statements of operations  and trade accounts receivable and accrued commission accounts as reflected on our balance sheets 
for any quarterly reporting period  we may not have actual usage data for certain energy suppliers and will need to estimate revenue 
we initially record revenue based on the energy consumers historical usage profile 
at the end of each reporting period  we adjust this historical profile to reflect actual usage for the period and estimate usage where actual usage is not available 
for the year ended december   we estimated usage for approximately of our revenue resulting in a negative  or approximately  adjustment to decrease revenue 
this decrease in revenue resulted in an approximate  decrease in sales and marketing expense related to third party commission expense associated with those revenues 
corresponding adjustments were made to trade accounts receivable and accrued commissions  respectively 
a difference between this estimate and actual usage would have an approximate  effect on our revenue for the year ended december  energy efficiency services we generally recognize revenues for energy efficiency services when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
due to the short term nature of projects typically two to three weeks  we utilize the completed contract method 
revenues are recognized based upon factors such as passage of title  installation  payments and customer acceptance 
allowance for doubtful accounts we provide for an allowance for doubtful accounts on a specifically identified basis  as well as through historical experience applied to an aging of accounts  if necessary 
trade accounts receivable are written off when deemed uncollectible 
to date write offs have not been material 

table of contents goodwill we use assumptions in establishing the carrying value and fair value of our goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets of acquired businesses 
we account for goodwill that results from acquired businesses in accordance with guidance with the financial accounting standards board fasb  under which goodwill and intangible assets having indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are assigned to reporting units and tested for impairment annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicate possible impairment 
we perform an annual impairment review during the fourth fiscal quarter of each year  or earlier  if indicators of potential impairment exist 
the impairment test for goodwill is a two step process 
step one consists of a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including the goodwill allocated to each reporting unit 
if the carrying amount is in excess of the fair value  step two requires the comparison of the implied fair value of the reporting unit whereby the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill will be recorded as an impairment loss 
we performed our annual impairment analysis in december and determined that no impairment of our goodwill existed 
intangible assets we use assumptions in establishing the carrying value  fair value and estimated lives of our intangible assets 
the criteria used for these assumptions include management s estimate of the asset s continuing ability to generate positive income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods compared to the carrying value of the asset  as well as the strategic significance of any identifiable intangible asset in our business objectives 
if assets are considered impaired  the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
useful lives and related amortization expense are based on an estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us 
factors that would influence the likelihood of a material change in our reported results include significant changes in the asset s ability to generate positive cash flow  a significant decline in the economic and competitive environment on which the asset depends and significant changes in our strategic business objectives 
intangible assets consist of customer relationships and contracts  purchased technology and other intangibles  and are stated at cost less accumulated amortization 
intangible assets with a finite life are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  which range from one to ten years 
impairment of long lived and intangible assets in accordance with guidance from the fasb  we periodically review long lived assets and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable or that the useful lives of those assets are no longer appropriate 
recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operation to which the assets relate to the carrying amount 
no impairment of our long lived assets was recorded as no change in circumstances indicated that the carrying value of the assets was not recoverable during fair value of financial instruments we follow asc  fair value measurements and disclosures asc  for fair value measurements 
asc defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the standard provides a consistent definition of fair value  which focuses on an exit price  which is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
the standard also prioritizes  within the measurement of fair value  the use of market based information over entity specific information and establishes a three level hierarchy for fair value measurements based on the nature of inputs used in the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date 
the hierarchy established under asc gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 
level pricing inputs are quoted prices available in active markets for identical investments as of the reporting date 
as required by asc  the company does not adjust the quoted price for these investments  even in situations where the company holds a large position and a sale could reasonably impact the quoted price 
level pricing inputs are quoted prices for similar investments  or inputs that are observable  either directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term through corroboration with observable market data 
level includes investments valued at quoted prices adjusted for legal or contractual restrictions specific to these investments 
level pricing inputs are unobservable for the investment  that is  inputs that reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
level includes investments that are supported by little or no market activity 

table of contents income taxes in accordance with guidance from the fasb  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined at the end of each period based on the future tax consequences that can be attributed to net operating loss carryforwards  as well as differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of the existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
deferred income tax expense or credits are based on changes in the asset or liability from period to period 
valuation allowances are provided if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income 
in determining the valuation allowance  we consider past performance  expected future taxable income  and qualitative factors which we consider to be appropriate in estimating future taxable income 
our forecast of expected future taxable income is for future periods that can be reasonably estimated 
results that differ materially from current expectations may cause us to change our judgment on future taxable income and adjust our existing tax valuation allowance 
our estimates in relation to income taxes affect income tax benefit and deferred tax assets as reflected on our statements of operations and balance sheets  respectively 
the deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will not be realized in the near term 
as of december   we had net deferred tax assets of approximately million against which a full valuation allowance has been established 
to the extent we determine that it is more likely than not that we will recover all of our deferred tax assets  it could result in an approximate million non cash tax benefit 
share based compensation we recognize the compensation cost from share based awards on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
for the years ended december  and  share based awards consisted of stock options and stock warrants  and for the year ended december   share based awards consisted of grants of restricted stock and stock options 
the restrictions on the restricted stock lapse over the vesting period 
the vesting period of share based awards is determined by the board of directors  and is generally four years for employees 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  testing goodwill for impairment  an amendment to fasb asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
the update provides an entity with the option to first assess qualitative factors in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
after assessing the qualitative factors  if an entity determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
if an entity concludes otherwise  then it is required to perform the first step of the two step impairment test as described in fasb asc topic entities have the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the first step of the two step impairment test as well as resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 
the asu is effective for our annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the impact of adopting this asu to be material to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
seasonality our revenue is subject to seasonality and fluctuations during the year primarily as a result of weather conditions and its impact on the demand for energy 
the majority of our revenue is generated from the commissions we receive under any given energy contract  which is tied to the energy consumer s consumption of energy 
therefore  revenue from natural gas consumption tends to be strongest during the winter months due to the increase in heating usage  and revenue from electricity consumption tends to be strongest during the summer months due to the increase in air conditioning usage 
our revenue is also subject to fluctuations within any given season  depending on the severity of weather conditions during a particularly cold winter or an unseasonably warm summer  energy consumption will rise 
in addition  transaction revenue in the natural gas and wholesale markets for which we invoice upon completion of the respective transaction tends to be higher in the first and fourth quarters when utilities and natural gas customers make their annual natural gas buys 
cyclicality we believe that our business will continue to be cyclical in nature and is tied  in part  to market energy prices which impact transaction volume 
when energy prices increase in competitive markets above the price levels of the regulated utilities  energy consumers are less likely to lock in to higher fixed price contracts in the competitive markets and so they are less likely to use our auction platform 
conversely  when energy prices decrease in competitive markets below the price levels of the regulated utilities  energy consumers are more likely to lock in to lower fixed price contracts in the competitive markets and they are more likely to use our auction platform 
although our short term revenue is impacted by usage trends  these cyclical effects will also have longer term implications on our business because we derive future revenue from current auctions 
our energy efficiency services segment tends to experience higher revenue in the third and fourth quarters as utilities approve funding for projects to be completed by the end of a calendar year 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency rates  interest rates  and other relevant market rates or price changes 
in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to market risk resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and we regularly evaluate our exposure to such changes 
our overall risk management strategy seeks to balance the magnitude of the exposure and the costs and availability of appropriate financial instruments 
impact of inflation and changing prices historically  our business has not been materially impacted by inflation 
we provide our service at the inception of the service contract between the energy supplier and energy consumer 
our fee is set as a fixed dollar amount per unit of measure and fluctuates with changes in energy demand over the contract period 
foreign currency fluctuation our commission revenue is primarily denominated in us dollars 
therefore  we are not directly affected by foreign exchange fluctuations on our current orders 
however  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates do have an effect on energy consumers access to us dollars and on pricing competition 
we have entered into non us dollar contracts but they have not had a material impact on our operations 
we do not believe that foreign exchange fluctuations will materially affect our results of operations
