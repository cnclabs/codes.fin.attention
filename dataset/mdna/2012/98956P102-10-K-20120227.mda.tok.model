item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding notes included elsewhere in this form k 
certain percentages presented in this discussion and analysis are calculated from the underlying whole dollar amounts and therefore may not recalculate from the rounded numbers used for disclosure purposes 
certain amounts in the and consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the presentation 
overview we believe the following developments or trends are important in understanding our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows for the year ended december  demand volume and mix trends increased volume and changes in the mix of product sales contributed percentage points of sales growth  which is percentage point above the rate of growth from compared to volume and mix trends continued to be challenged by the global economy 
we believe reconstructive procedure volumes in continued to be lower than historical utilization rates and lower than demographic trends would indicate 
this effect was particularly pronounced in our americas operating segment  where the impact of ongoing high unemployment and low consumer confidence contributed to softness 
long term indicators still point toward sustained growth driven by an aging global population  obesity  more active lifestyles  growth in emerging markets  new material technologies  advances in surgical techniques and proven clinical benefits of joint replacement procedures 
in addition  the ongoing shift in demand to premium products  such as prolong highly crosslinked polyethylene  trabecular metal technology products  hip stems with kinectiv technology  high flex knees  porous hip stems and the introduction of patient specific devices  is expected to continue to positively affect sales growth 
pricing trends global average selling prices declined by percent in compared to selling prices in the americas  europe and asia pacific declined by percent  were flat  and declined by percent  respectively  during we continue to see pricing pressure from governmental healthcare cost containment efforts and from local hospitals and health systems 
due to these pressures and a biannual price adjustment in japan in april  we expect selling prices will have approximately a negative percent effect on sales on a global basis in foreign currency exchange rates for  foreign currency exchange rates resulted in a percent increase in sales 
if foreign currency exchange rates remain consistent with year end rates  we estimate that a stronger dollar versus foreign currency exchange rates will have a negative effect in of approximately percent on sales 
we address currency risk through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of forward contracts and options solely to manage foreign currency volatility and risk 
changes to foreign currency exchange rates affect sales growth  but due to gains losses on hedge contracts and options  which are recorded in cost of products sold  the effect on net earnings in the near term is expected to be minimal 
global economic conditions we believe adverse conditions in the global economy continue to negatively affect elective hospital procedures 
however  we continue to believe that procedure deferrals will diminish slowly over time  and that growth rates will trend higher as they track more in line with historical usage rates among the aging population 
we believe these demographic trends will ultimately foster long term sustained growth even if in the short term the timing of these elective procedures continues to be adversely affected 
outlook we estimate our sales will grow between and percent in such sales growth assumes knee and hip procedures will grow in low single digits with modest global economic growth and relatively stable employment 
as discussed previously  we expect pricing to have a negative effect on sales growth of percent  and foreign currency exchange rates to have a negative effect on sales growth of approximately percent based upon december  rates 
assuming currency rates remain at december  levels  we expect our gross margin to be between and percent of sales in this takes into account the cost pressures we have experienced from lower than planned manufacturing volumes  as well as anticipated losses from foreign currency hedges 
however  if currency rates remain at december  levels the hedge losses we recognize in will be less than the hedge losses recognized in we expect to continue making investments in research and development r d in the range of to percent of sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a as a percent of sales is expected to be between and percent as we realize operational efficiencies from global restructuring and transformation initiatives and further leverage revenue growth 
we expect to incur approximately million of expenses in related to certain restructuring and transformation initiatives 
the programs are targeted at streamlining the organization and business processes 
they

we expect to recognize the majority of these million of expenses in special items on our statement of net earnings 
the gross margin and sg a percentages discussed above do not include these expenses 
assuming variable rates remain at december  levels  we expect interest income and expense  net  to be approximately million in  which is higher than primarily due to a million offering of senior notes completed in november results of operations net sales by reportable segment the following tables present net sales by reportable segment and the components of the percentage changes dollars in millions year ended december  volume mix foreign exchange inc dec price americas europe asia pacific total year ended december  volume mix foreign exchange inc dec price americas europe asia pacific total foreign exchange as used in the tables in this report represents the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on sales growth

we estimate that industry procedure volumes were flat to slightly positive on a global basis in  while pricing was negative 
we believe procedure volumes will continue to be pressured from a cyclical downturn related to uncertain global economic conditions 
the nexgen complete knee solution product line  including gender solutions knee femoral implants  the nexgen lps flex knee and the nexgen cr flex knee  together with the gender solutions natural knee flex system  led knee sales 
in addition  sales of the gender solutions patello femoral joint and zimmer patient specific instruments exhibited growth 
in europe  changes in foreign currency exchange rates affected knee sales in the years ended december  and by positive percent and negative percent  respectively 
in asia pacific  changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively affected knee sales in the years ended december  and by percent and percent  respectively 
hips hip sales grew by percent in driven by new product introductions  such as our continuum acetabular system and our zimmer m l taper stem with kinectiv technology 
additionally  negative publicity in the marketplace over the use of hip systems that use metal on metal technology may have contributed to an increase in sales of hip systems with alternative bearing surfaces 
metal on metal technology represents only a small portion of our hip sales 
therefore  our market share position may have benefited from customers using our hip systems instead of a competitor s metal on metal system 
the zimmer m l taper stem  the zimmer m l taper stem with kinectiv technology  the cls spotorno stem from the cls hip system and the alloclassic zweym ller hip stem led hip stem sales 
in addition  sales of the continuum acetabular system  trilogy it acetabular system and allofit it alloclassic acetabular system and the trabecular metal revision shell and augment cups were strong when compared to the prior year periods  as were sales of biolox delta heads and fitmore hip stems 
in europe  changes in foreign currency exchange rates affected hip sales in the years ended december  and by positive percent and negative percent  respectively 
in asia pacific  our december acquisition of beijing montagne medical device co  ltd 
made a contribution to that operating segment s sales growth in additionally in asia pacific  changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively affected hip sales in the years ended december  and by percent and percent  respectively 
extremities extremities delivered solid sales growth the past two years  led by the zimmer trabecular metal reverse shoulder system and the bigliani flatow complete shoulder solution 
trabecular metal technology is playing a critical role in addressing previously unmet clinical needs in the expanding extremities market 
we continue to see competitive pressure in this category  but expect that new product and instrument introductions will help to accelerate growth 
dental dental experienced sales growth of percent in compared to percent growth in  including a percent increase in due to pricing 
a significant portion of this pricing increase was due to a change in the agreement that started in the fourth quarter of by which we distribute certain regenerative products 
under the prior agreement  we did not take title to the products and only received a commission from the end user sale 
under the new agreement  we take title to the product and recognize the final end user sale along with the cost of products sold and any other selling related costs 
sales were led by the tapered screw vent implant system 
trauma trauma sales increased by percent in after experiencing percent sales growth in in  we continued the launch of the zimmer natural nail system  which contributed significantly to our trauma sales 
in addition to the zimmer natural nail system  zimmer periarticular locking plates and the zimmer ncb plating system led trauma sales  while sales of cable products also made a strong contribution 
spine we experienced mid to high single digit sales declines in spine each of the past two years 
the sales declines have come from our americas segment  as both europe and asia pacific have experienced sales growth in each of the past two years 
in the americas segment  we have experienced operational challenges with our sales force  a difficult reimbursement landscape and a significant decline in sales of our dynesys dynamic stabilization system 
overall  solid sales of the pathfinder and sequoia pedicle screw systems  our universal clamp system and trabecular metal technology products partly offset a decline in sales of the dynesys system 
surgical and other surgical and other delivered solid sales growth the past two years 
surgical and other sales were led by palacos bone cement and tourniquet products 
our wound debridement products also made a strong contribution to sales results  as did our december acquisition of sodem diffusion sa

under the program  for derivatives which qualify as hedges of future cash flows  the effective portion of changes in fair value is temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income and then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item affects earnings 
due to the weakening of the us dollar in  we recognized foreign currency hedge losses in costs of products sold versus hedge gains in also in  lower selling prices  higher average costs per unit sold  and higher inventory step up charges all contributed to lower gross margins 
in  lower average selling prices  higher average costs per unit sold and the impact of our hedging program also negatively affected gross margin  but were offset by lower excess and obsolescence charges from improved inventory management and certain product specific matters that were experienced in which did not recur in the following table reconciles the gross margin changes for and year ended december  prior year gross margin lower average selling prices increased average cost per unit excess and obsolete inventory foreign currency exchange impact  net inventory step up other current year gross margin operating expenses r d expense and r d expense as a percent of sales increased in each of the last two years 
these increases are in line with our strategy to invest in new product development activities across nearly all of our product categories  as well as to increase spending on external research  clinical  regulatory and quality initiatives 
we continue to expect r d spending to be between to percent of sales in sg a has increased in dollars terms over the last three years  but has decreased as a percent of sales 
in  sg a increased in dollar terms from primarily due to variable selling and distribution expenses from higher sales  increased intangible asset amortization from acquisitions completed in december and higher bad debt expenses primarily from our europe operating segment 
these were partially offset by lower product liability charges recorded in sg a related to the durom cup 
for more information regarding durom cup claims  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
sg a as a percent of sales decreased by basis points from reflecting disciplined spending and the effect of our transformation initiatives  which has lowered expenses such as salaries  wages and benefits 
in  sg a increased in dollar terms from primarily due to variable selling and distribution expenses from higher sales and from increased spending to fund medical education programs 
sg a as a percent of sales in decreased by basis points from  reflecting disciplined spending combined with a higher base of sales  and no expense in related to corporate monitoring that ended after the first quarter of certain claims expense is a provision for estimated liabilities to durom cup patients undergoing revision surgeries

for more information regarding these claims  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in connection with our annual goodwill impairment tests performed in the fourth quarters of and  we noted that the carrying values of the net assets of our us spine reporting unit were in excess of the reporting unit s estimated

as a result  we recorded goodwill impairment charges of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
for more information regarding goodwill impairment and the factors that led to the impairment  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we recognized a net curtailment and settlement gain of million during related to amending our us and puerto rico postretirement benefit plans

special items expenses for the years ended december   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
in  we continued reducing management layers and restructured certain areas  resulting in million of severance and termination related expenses 
in  we also incurred million in consulting and professional fees associated with acquisitions and our business transformation initiatives 
as a result of our acquisitions and transformation initiatives  we also incurred asset impairments  facility and employee relocation costs  contract termination expenses and other costs 
special items in included expenses related to restructuring of our information technology infrastructure as well as our management structure 
this resulted in million of asset impairment charges and million of employee severance and termination related expenses 
in  we also incurred consulting and professional fees  facility and employee relocation costs  contract termination expenses and other various expenses resulting from acquisitions 
special items also included the impairment of an available for sale security that was acquired as part of a business acquisition and certain litigation related matters 
special items in included a workforce realignment  which resulted in the elimination of positions in some areas and increases in others to support long term growth 
as a result of this realignment and headcount reductions from acquisitions  we incurred approximately million of severance and termination related expenses 
other special items in included approximately million of expenses related to contract termination costs  million related to certain litigation matters that were recognized during the period and various costs related to acquisitions 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding special items charges 
interest income  interest expense  income taxes and net earnings interest expense decreased in after a significant increase in from in november we issued billion of senior unsecured notes which was the primary cause of the increase in the decrease in interest expense in is the result of interest rate swap agreements we entered into in late and early to convert a portion of our fixed rate debt into variable rate debt 
interest income has increased due to higher balances of cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term investments and higher returns on certain investments 
our effective tax rate etr on earnings before income taxes for the years ended december   and was percent  percent and percent  respectively 
the variation of our etr has largely been affected by certain claims and goodwill impairment charges 
certain claims expense favorably affects our etr because it lowers the income within our us operations relative to our foreign operations 
goodwill impairment charges negatively affect our etr because no tax benefit is recorded on such charges 
additionally  in and our etr was favorably impacted by the resolution of certain tax contingencies 
these discrete items account for the majority of the variation in our etrs in the past three years 
as a result of the revenues and expenses discussed previously  net earnings in increased percent compared to in  net earnings decreased percent compared to basic and diluted earnings per share increased percent in compared to  while basic and diluted earnings per share decreased percent from the disproportionate change in earnings per share as compared to net earnings is attributed to the effect of share repurchases 
non gaap operating performance measures we use non gaap financial measures to evaluate our operating performance that differ from financial measures determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
our non gaap financial measures exclude the impact of inventory step up charges  special items  certain claims  net curtailment and settlement and goodwill impairment  and the taxes on those items in addition to certain other tax adjustments 
we use this information internally and believe it is helpful to investors because it allows more meaningful period to period comparisons of our ongoing operating results  it helps to perform trend analysis and to better identify operating trends that may otherwise be masked or distorted by these types of items  and it provides a higher degree of transparency of certain items 
certain of these non gaap financial measures are used as metrics for our incentive compensation programs 
our non gaap adjusted net earnings used for internal management purposes for the years ended december   and were million  million  and million  respectively  and our non gaap adjusted diluted earnings per share were   and  respectively

healthcare reform in the us we continue to assess the impact that federal healthcare reform will have on our business 
federal healthcare reform includes a percent excise tax on a majority of our us sales that is scheduled to be implemented in liquidity and capital resources cash flows provided by operating activities were  million in compared to  million in the principal source of cash from operating activities in was net earnings 
non cash charges included in net earnings accounted for another million of operating cash 
all other items of operating cash flows in provided million of cash 
the lower cash flows provided by operating activities in the period were primarily due to lower receivable collections and increased product liability payments 
we paid approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively  related to durom cup product liability claims 
we estimate the net remaining liability after insurance recovery for durom cup claims as of december   is million 
we expect to pay the majority of this amount over the next five years 
at december   we had days of sales outstanding in trade accounts receivable  an increase of days when compared to december   reflecting changes in certain accounts receivable factoring programs and the economic environment in our europe operating segment 
at december   we had days of inventory on hand  a decrease of days compared to december  days of inventory on hand have decreased due to higher cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales  most notably from foreign currency hedge losses  and a reduction in us consignment inventory that was achieved through new inventory management strategies 
cash flows used in investing activities were million in  compared to million in additions to instruments decreased in compared to the period because the period included investments in new product launches  such as our continuum acetabular system  and included instrumentation in our knee product category  such as posterior referencing instrumentation 
spending on other property  plant and equipment increased in compared to the period as there were no significant infrastructure initiatives in during  for both instruments and property  plant and equipment  we expect to purchase approximately to million 
we feel this level of capital spending is necessary to support new product related investments and replacement of older machinery and equipment 
beginning in and with more significance thereafter  we began investing some of our cash and cash equivalents in highly rated debt securities 
the purchases and any sales or maturities of these investments are reflected as cash flows from investing activities 
acquired intellectual property rights relate to lump sum payments made to certain healthcare professionals and institutions in place of future royalty payments that otherwise would have been due under the terms of existing contractual arrangements 
in the past three years  we have made various business acquisitions including extraortho  inc  beijing montagne medical device co  ltd  sodem diffusion sa and certain foreign based distributors 
cash flows used in financing activities were million for  compared to million in in and  we issued senior unsecured notes in public offerings 
we used some of the proceeds to repurchase our common stock and to repay outstanding debt on our revolving credit facilities 
in december  our board of directors declared a dividend of per share to be paid in april to stockholders of record as of the close of business on march  based upon shares outstanding as of december   we would pay million 
we expect to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis  however future dividends are subject to approval of the board of directors and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change 
we have four tranches of senior notes outstanding million aggregate principal amount of percent notes due november   million aggregate principal amount of percent notes due november   million aggregate principal amount of percent notes due november  and million aggregate principal amount of percent notes due november  interest on each series is payable on may and november of each year until maturity 

table of contents zimmer holdings  inc 
form k annual report we may redeem the senior notes at our election in whole or in part at any time prior to maturity at a redemption price equal to the greater of percent of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed  or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption  discounted to the date of redemption on a semi annual basis at the treasury rate as defined in the debt agreement  plus basis points in the case of the notes  basis points in the case of the and notes  and basis points in the case of the notes 
we will also pay the accrued and unpaid interest on the senior notes to the redemption date 
we have a five year  million revolving  multi currency  senior unsecured credit facility maturing november  senior credit facility 
we had million outstanding under the senior credit facility at december   and an availability of  million 
we intend to secure another senior credit facility in before our current senior credit facility matures 
we also have available uncommitted credit facilities totaling million 
we place our cash and cash equivalents in highly rated financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity 
we invest only in high quality financial instruments in accordance with our internal investment policy 
as of december   we had short term and long term investments in debt securities with a fair value of million 
these investments are in debt securities of many different issuers and therefore we have no significant concentration of risk with a single issuer 
all of these debt securities remain highly rated and therefore we believe the risk of default by the issuers is low 
as of december    million of our cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term investments are held in jurisdictions outside of the us and are expected to be indefinitely reinvested for continued use in foreign operations 
repatriation of these assets to the us would have negative tax consequences 
approximately million of this amount is denominated in us dollars and therefore bears no foreign currency translation risk 
the balance of these assets is denominated in currencies of the various countries where we operate 
we may use excess cash to repurchase additional common stock under our share repurchase program 
as of december   we had authority to repurchase up to billion shares of common stock through december  management believes that cash flows from operations and available borrowings under the senior credit facility are sufficient to meet our expected working capital  capital expenditure and debt service needs 
should investment opportunities arise  we believe that our earnings  balance sheet and cash flows will allow us to obtain additional capital  if necessary 
contractual obligations we have entered into contracts with various third parties in the normal course of business that will require future payments 
the following table illustrates our contractual obligations in millions contractual obligations total and and and thereafter long term debt interest payments operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total contractual obligations million of the other long term liabilities on our balance sheet are liabilities related to defined benefit pension plans 
defined benefit plan liabilities are based upon the underfunded status of the respective plans  they are not based upon future contributions 
due to uncertainties regarding future plan asset performance  changes in interest rates and our intentions with respect to voluntary contributions  we are unable to reasonably estimate future contributions beyond therefore  this table does not include any amounts related to future contributions to our plans 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our defined benefit plans 
also included in other long term liabilities on our balance sheet are liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits and corresponding interest and penalties thereon 
due to the uncertainties inherent in these liabilities  such as the ultimate timing and resolution of tax audits  we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount or period in which potential tax payments related to these positions will be made 
therefore  this table does not include any obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information on these unrecognized tax benefits 
we have entered into various agreements that may result in future payments dependent upon various events such as the achievement of certain product r d milestones  sales milestones  or at our discretion to maintain exclusive rights to distribute a product 
since there is uncertainty on the timing or whether such payments will have to be made  we have not included them in this table 
these payments could range from to million 

table of contents zimmer holdings  inc 
form k annual report critical accounting estimates our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods 
significant accounting policies which require management s judgment are discussed below 
excess inventory and instruments we must determine as of each balance sheet date how much  if any  of our inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at our carrying cost 
similarly  we must also determine if instruments on hand will be put to productive use or remain undeployed as a result of excess supply 
accordingly  inventory and instruments are written down to their net realizable value 
to determine the appropriate net realizable value  we evaluate current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our products and instrument systems and components 
the basis for the determination is generally the same for all inventory and instrument items and categories except for work in process inventory  which is recorded at cost 
obsolete or discontinued items are generally destroyed and completely written off 
management evaluates the need for changes to inventory and instruments net realizable values based on market conditions  competitive offerings and other factors on a regular basis 
income taxes our income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid 
we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense 
we estimate income tax expense and income tax liabilities and assets by taxable jurisdiction 
realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits 
we evaluate deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provide valuation allowances unless we determine it is more likely than not that the deferred tax benefit will be realized 
federal income taxes are provided on the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the us the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations 
we are subject to regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve 
we record our income tax provisions based on our knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances  including existing tax laws  our experience with previous settlement agreements  the status of current examinations and our understanding of how the tax authorities view certain relevant industry and commercial matters 
we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with the financial accounting standards board s fasb guidance on income taxes and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available 
due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined 
commitments and contingencies accruals for product liability and other claims are established with the assistance of internal and external legal counsel based on current information and historical settlement information for claims  related legal fees and for claims incurred but not reported 
we use an actuarial model to assist management in determining an appropriate level of accruals for product liability claims 
historical patterns of claim loss development over time are statistically analyzed to arrive at factors which are then applied to loss estimates in the actuarial model 
in addition to our general product liability  we have recorded provisions totaling million related to the durom cup  including million in see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the durom cup 
goodwill and intangible assets we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually  or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we evaluate the carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
significant assumptions are required to estimate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets  most notably estimated future cash flows generated by these assets 
as such  these fair valuation measurements use significant unobservable inputs 
changes to these assumptions could require us to record impairment charges on these assets 
in the fourth quarter of  we determined our us spine reporting unit s carrying value was in excess of its estimated fair value 
fair value was determined using an equal weighting of income and market approaches 
fair value under the income approach was determined by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit 
fair value under the market approach utilized the comparable transaction methodology  which uses valuation indicators determined from sales of other businesses that are similar to our us spine reporting unit 
as a result  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge for the us spine reporting unit of million during the year ended december  in the year ended december   we also recorded an impairment charge related to this reporting unit of million 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion and the factors that contributed to these impairment charges 
in our annual impairment testing in  we employed a similar methodology of using income and market approaches to estimate fair value for the us spine reporting unit 
the impairment test concluded that goodwill was not impaired 
however  since goodwill had been written down to its implied fair value of million in the prior year  the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was only percent greater than its carrying value 
therefore  minor changes to the estimated 
table of contents zimmer holdings  inc 
form k annual report discounted cash flows or market conditions may cause us to recognize further impairment charges in the future 
we have six other reporting units with goodwill assigned to them 
we estimated the fair value of those reporting units using the income approach by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit  or by doing a qualitative assessment of changes in fair value from the prior year s income approach 
for each of those six reporting units  the estimated fair values substantially exceeded their carrying value 
as of december   we had intangible assets of million related to trademarks and trade names  of which million are classified as having an indefinite life 
we currently have and anticipate future product development efforts that may replace the current products that use those trademarks and trade names 
while it is anticipated  it is not certain that these new products will utilize these trademarks and trade names 
if these new products do not use these trademarks and trade names  these assets may be impaired and or their useful lives may need adjusted 
share based payment we measure share based payment expense at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize expense over the requisite service period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected life of stock options and the expected volatility of our stock 
additionally  we must estimate the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
we estimate expected volatility based upon the implied volatility of actively traded options on our stock 
the expected life of stock options and estimated forfeitures are based upon our employees historical exercise and forfeiture behaviors 
the assumptions used in determining the grant date fair value and the expected forfeitures represent management s best estimates

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations  including risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices that could affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we manage our exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we use derivative financial instruments solely as risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes 
foreign currency exchange risk we operate on a global basis and are exposed to the risk that our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we are primarily exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to transactions and net assets denominated in euros  swiss francs  japanese yen  british pounds  canadian dollars  australian dollars  korean won  swedish krona  czech koruna  thai baht  taiwan dollars  south african rand  russian rubles and indian rupees 
we manage the foreign currency exposure centrally  on a combined basis  which allows us to net exposures and to take advantage of any natural offsets 
to reduce the uncertainty of foreign currency exchange rate movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies  we enter into derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange forward contracts and options with major financial institutions 
these forward contracts and options are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions  primarily intercompany sale and purchase transactions  for periods consistent with commitments 
realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts and options that qualify as cash flow hedges are temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income  then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item affects net earnings 
for contracts outstanding at december   we had obligations to purchase us dollars and sell euros  japanese yen  british pounds  canadian dollars  australian dollars  korean won  swedish krona  czech koruna  thai baht  taiwan dollars  south african rand  russian rubles and indian rupees and purchase swiss francs and sell us dollars at set maturity dates ranging from january through june the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase us dollars at december  were billion 
the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase swiss francs at december  were million 
the weighted average contract rates outstanding at december  were euro usd  swiss franc usd  usd japanese yen  british pound usd  usd canadian dollar  australian dollar usd  usd korean won  usd swedish krona  usd czech koruna  usd thai baht  usd taiwan dollar  usd south african rand  usd russian ruble and usd indian ruppee 
we maintain written policies and procedures governing our risk management activities 
our policy requires that critical terms of hedging instruments are the same as hedged forecasted transactions 
on this basis  with respect to cash flow hedges  changes in cash flows attributable to hedged transactions are generally expected to be completely offset by changes in the fair value of hedge instruments 
as part of our risk management program  we also perform sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in revenue  operating results  cash flows and financial position relating to hypothetical movements in currency exchange rates 
a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts outstanding at december  indicated that  if the us dollar uniformly changed in value by percent relative to the various currencies  with no change in the interest differentials  the fair value of those contracts would increase or decrease earnings before income taxes in periods through  depending on the direction of the change  by the following average approximate amounts in millions currency average amount euro swiss franc japanese yen british pound canadian dollar australian dollar korean won swedish krona czech koruna thai baht taiwan dollars south african rand russian rubles indian rupees any change in the fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a currency exchange rate is expected to be largely offset by a change in the value of the hedged transaction 
consequently  foreign currency exchange contracts would not subject us to material risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets  liabilities and transactions being hedged 
we had net investment exposures to net foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities of  million at december   primarily in euros and japanese yen 
 million of the net asset exposure at december  relates to goodwill recorded in the europe and asia pacific geographic segments

form k annual report we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with terms of one month to manage currency exposures for monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than an entity s functional currency 
as a result  foreign currency remeasurement gains losses recognized in earnings are generally offset with gains losses on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts in the same reporting period 
commodity price risk we purchase raw material commodities such as cobalt chrome  titanium  tantalum  polymer and sterile packaging 
we enter into supply contracts generally with terms of to months  where available  on these commodities to alleviate the effect of market fluctuation in prices 
as part of our risk management program  we perform sensitivity analyses related to potential commodity price changes 
a percent price change across all these commodities would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
interest rate risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we manage our exposure to interest rate risks through our regular operations and financing activities 
we invest our cash and cash equivalents primarily in highly rated corporate commercial paper and bank deposits 
we also have short term and long term investments in highly rated corporate debt securities  us government and agency debt securities  us government treasury funds  municipal bonds  foreign government debt securities  commercial paper and certificates of deposit 
the primary investment objective is to ensure capital preservation of our invested principal funds 
currently  we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we are exposed to interest rate risk on our debt obligations and our cash and cash equivalents 
presently  all of our debt outstanding under the senior credit facility bears interest at short term rates 
in  we entered into interest rate swap agreements with a consolidated notional amount of million that hedge a portion of our million percent senior notes due november  on the interest rate swap agreements outstanding as of december   we receive a fixed interest rate of percent and we pay variable interest equal to the three month libor plus an average of basis points 
the interest rate swap agreements are to manage our exposure to interest rate movements by converting fixed rate debt into variable rate debt 
the objective of the instruments is to more closely align interest expense with interest income received on cash and cash equivalents 
these derivative instruments are designated as fair value hedges under us gaap 
changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recorded in earnings and are offset by gains or losses on the underlying debt instrument 
in  we entered into multiple cross currency interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of  million japanese yen to hedge us dollar debt borrowed by our japan subsidiary 
we designated these swaps as cash flow hedges of the foreign currency exchange and interest rate risks 
the effective portion of changes in fair value of the cross currency interest rate swaps is temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income and then recognized in interest expense when the hedged item affects net earnings 
on the cross currency interest rate swap agreements outstanding as of december   we pay a fixed interest rate of percent and receive variable interest equal to the three month libor plus basis points 
the cross currency interest rate swap agreements manage foreign currency exchange risk associated with remeasuring the debt to japanese yen and the interest rate risk associated with the variable rate debt 
we entered into these instruments in order to take advantage of a market situation where we could lock in interest at a very low  fixed rate on debt 
based upon our overall interest rate exposure as of december   a change of percent in interest rates  assuming the amount outstanding remains constant  would not have a material effect on net interest expense 
this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
credit risk financial instruments  which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk  are primarily cash and cash equivalents  short term and long term investments  derivative instruments  counterparty transactions and accounts receivable 
we place our investments in highly rated financial institutions or highly rated debt securities and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity 
we believe we do not have any significant credit risk on our cash and cash equivalents and investments 
we are exposed to credit loss if the financial institutions or counterparties issuing the debt security fail to perform 
however  this loss is limited to the amounts  if any  by which the obligations of the counterparty to the financial instrument contract exceed our obligation 
we also minimize exposure to credit risk by dealing with a diversified group of major financial institutions 
we manage credit risk by monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties using standard credit guidelines 
we do not anticipate any nonperformance by any of the counterparties 
concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across a number of geographic areas and by frequent monitoring of the creditworthiness of the customers to whom credit is granted in the normal course of business 
substantially all of our trade receivables are concentrated in the public and private hospital and healthcare industry in the

repayment is dependent upon the financial stability of these industry sectors and the respective countries national economic and healthcare systems 
most notably  in europe healthcare is sponsored by the government 
because we sell products to public hospitals in those countries  we are indirectly exposed to government budget constraints 
we continue to monitor the financial crisis in the euro zone and the indirect credit exposure we have to those governments through their public hospitals 
in countries that have been widely recognized as presenting the highest risk  our accounts receivable  net of allowances for doubtful accounts  in greece  italy  portugal and spain total million  or of our total accounts receivable balance  net  with italy and spain accounting for million of that amount 
we are actively monitoring the situations in these countries and  to the extent the respective governments ability to fund their public hospital programs deteriorates  we may have to record significant bad debt expenses in the future 
while we are exposed to risks from the broader healthcare industry in europe and around the world  there is no significant net exposure due to any individual customer 
exposure to credit risk is controlled through credit approvals  credit limits and monitoring procedures and we believe that reserves for losses are adequate
