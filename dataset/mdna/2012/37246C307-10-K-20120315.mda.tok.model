item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
see item a risk factors regarding certain factors known to genvec that could cause reported financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future results  including discussions of the risks related to the development  regulatory approval  manufacture  proprietary protection of our product candidates  and their market success relative to alternative products 
overview genvec  inc genvec  we  our  or the company is a biopharmaceutical company using differentiated  proprietary technologies to create superior therapeutics and vaccines 
a key component of our strategy is to develop and commercialize our product candidates through collaborations 
genvec is working with leading companies and organizations such as novartis  merial  and the us government to support a portfolio of product programs that address the prevention and treatment of a number of significant human and animal health concerns 
genvec s development programs address therapeutic areas such as hearing loss and balance disorders  as well as vaccines against infectious diseases including respiratory syncytial virus rsv  herpes simplex virus hsv  dengue fever  and malaria 
in the area of animal health we are developing vaccines against foot and mouth disease fmd 
our core technology has the important advantage of localizing protein delivery in the body 
this is accomplished by using our adenovector platform to locally deliver genes to cells  which then direct production of the desired protein 
this approach reduces side effects typically associated with systemic delivery of proteins 
for vaccines  the goal is to induce an immune response against a target protein or antigen 
this is accomplished by using an adenovector to deliver a gene that causes production of an antigen  which then stimulates the desired immune reaction by the body 
our research and development activities yield product candidates that utilize our technology platform and we believe represent potential commercial opportunities 
for example  preclinical research in hearing loss and balance disorders suggests delivery of the atonal gene using genvec s adenovector technology may have the potential to restore hearing and balance function 
we are working with novartis institutes for biomedical research  inc together with novartis ag and its subsidiary corporations  including novartis pharma ag  novartis  on the discovery and development of novel treatments for hearing loss and balance disorders 
there are currently no effective treatments available for patients who have lost all balance function  and hearing loss remains a major unmet medical problem 
we have multiple vaccines in development leveraging our core adenovector technology including our preclinical programs to develop vaccine candidates for the prevention of rsv and hsv 
we also have programs with the us naval medical research center nmrc to develop vaccines for dengue fever and malaria 
in addition  we have provided vaccine candidates to the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid of the national institutes of health nih against hiv 
in the field of animal health  we are working with merial to commercialize vaccines for the prevention of a major animal health problem  fmd 
development efforts for this program are also supported by the us department of homeland security dhs and in collaboration with the us department of agriculture usda 
our business strategy is focused on entering into collaborative arrangements with third parties to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
in the event that third parties take over the development for one or more of our product candidates  the estimated completion date would largely be under the control of that third party rather than us 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which proprietary products or indications  if any  will be subject to future collaborative arrangements  in whole or in part  and how such arrangements would affect our development plan or capital requirements 
our programs may also benefit from subsidies  grants  or government or agency sponsored studies that could reduce our development costs 

table of contents an element of our business strategy is to pursue  as resources permit  the research and development of a range of product candidates for a variety of indications 
this is intended to allow us to diversify the risks associated with our research and development expenditures 
to the extent we are unable to maintain a broad range of product candidates  our dependence on the success of one or a few product candidates would increase 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  among others  we are unable to estimate the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when  if ever  and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product 
our inability to complete our research and development projects in a timely manner or our failure to enter into collaborative agreements  when appropriate  could significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely impact our liquidity 
these uncertainties could force us to seek additional  external sources of financing from time to time in order to continue with our business strategy 
our inability to raise additional capital  or to do so on terms reasonably acceptable to us  would jeopardize the future success of our business 
however  we believe that we have sufficient operating capital to continue our current research  development and collaborative activities through at least december  our research and development expenses were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
these expenses were divided between our research and development platforms in the following manner

on march   we announced that we discontinued our phase clinical study of tnferade in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer because an interim analysis of clinical data indicated that the trial would not meet its primary endpoint 
expenses for consist of wind down costs with respect to tnferade matters 
we have incurred million of expenses on the development of this product candidate since the commencement of this program in costs since the commencement of this program include research  development  clinical trials  clinical supply costs  and an allocation of corporate general and administrative expenses 
hearing loss and balance disorders 
in a collaboration with novartis  our hearing and balance disorders program is focused on the restoration of hearing and balance function through the regeneration of critical cells of the inner ear 
since commencement of this development programs  genvec has incurred approximately million in research and development costs  including an allocation of corporate general and administrative expenses  most of which have been funded under our agreement with novartis 
vaccines 
under our corporate and government funded vaccine programs  genvec continues to develop vaccine candidates against malaria  hiv  rsv  hsv  and other infectious diseases  as well as an animal health vaccine for fmd 
since commencement of these vaccine development programs in  genvec has incurred approximately million in research and development costs  including an allocation of corporate general and administrative expenses  most of which have been funded under our agreements with our various sponsors 
we have recently entered into a collaboration with merial to develop vaccines for the prevention of a major animal health problem  fmd 
development efforts for this program are supported by the us department of homeland security and in collaboration with the us department of agriculture 
to date  none of our proprietary or collaborative programs has resulted in a commercial product  therefore  we have not received any revenues or royalties from the sale of products 
we have funded our operations primarily through public and private placements of equity securities  payments received under collaborative programs with public and private entities  and debt financings 

table of contents we have incurred operating losses each year since inception and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in research and development and from general and administrative activities 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  sponsored research costs  patent costs  technology access fees  clinical trial costs  and other expenses related to our product development and research programs 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefit expenses for executive  finance and other administrative personnel  facility costs  professional fees  business development costs  insurance premiums  and other general corporate expenditures 
our estimated future capital requirements are uncertain and could change materially as a result of many factors  including the progress of our research  development  clinical  manufacturing  and commercialization activities 
we estimate we have sufficient resources to fund our currently planned operations through at least december   subject to changes in the progress of our research  development  clinical  manufacturing  and commercialization activities 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates using authoritative pronouncements  historical experience  and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
we have discussed the development  selection  and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
while we base estimates and assumptions on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future  actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions 
we believe the following accounting policies to be critical because they require significant estimates or judgment on the part of management revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when all four of the following criteria are met a contract is executed  the contract price is fixed and determinable  delivery of the service or products have occurred  and collectability of the contract amounts is considered probable 
our collaborative research and development agreements can provide for upfront license fees  research payments  and or substantive milestone payments 
upfront nonrefundable fees associated with license and development agreements where we have continuing involvement in the agreement are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized over the estimated service period 
if the estimated service period is subsequently modified  the period over which the upfront fee is recognized is modified accordingly on a prospective basis 
non refundable research and development fees for which no future performance obligations exist are recognized when collection is assured 
substantive milestone payments are considered performance payments and are recognized upon achievement of the milestone if all of the following criteria are met i achievement of the milestone involves a degree of risk and was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  ii substantive effort is involved in achieving the milestone  and iii the amount of the milestone payment is reasonable in relation to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement 
determination of whether a milestone meets the aforementioned conditions involves the judgment of management 
research and development revenue from cost reimbursement and cost plus fixed fee agreements is recognized as earned based on the performance requirements of the contract 
revisions in revenues  cost  and billing factors eg indirect rate estimates are accounted for in the period of change 
reimbursable costs under such contracts are subject to audit and retroactive adjustment 
contract revenues and accounts receivable reported in the financial statements are recorded at the amount expected to be received 
contract revenues are adjusted to actual upon final audit and retroactive adjustment 
estimated contractual allowances are provided based on management s evaluation of current contract terms and past experience with disallowed costs and reimbursement levels 
payments received in advance of work performed are recorded as deferred revenue 

table of contents clinical trial expenses and research and development activities 
we accrue estimated costs for clinical and preclinical studies based on estimates of work performed 
we believe this method best aligns our expenses with the efforts we expend 
we monitor the progress of the trials and their related activities to the extent possible and adjust the accruals accordingly 
adjustments to accruals are charged to expense in the period in which the facts that give rise to the adjustment become known 
the expenditures necessary to execute our business plan are subject to numerous uncertainties  which may adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more  but the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty  and intended use of a product candidate 
while we currently do not have any active clinical trials underway  we estimate that clinical trials of the type we generally conduct are typically completed over the following timelines

clinical phase estimated completion date phase years phase years phase years the duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during the clinical trial protocol  including  among others  the following the number of patients that ultimately participate in the trial  the duration of patient follow up that seems appropriate in view of the results  the number of clinical sites included in the trials  and the length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects 
we test potential product candidates in preclinical studies to identify indications for which they may be product candidates 
we may conduct multiple clinical trials to cover a variety of indications for each product candidate 
as we obtain results from trials  we may elect to discontinue clinical trials for certain product candidates or for certain indications in order to focus our resources on more promising product candidates or indications 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation based on the estimated grant date fair value of the stock using the black scholes option pricing model 
the estimated grant date fair value is recognized in earnings over the requisite service period

results of operations years ended december  and revenue revenue 
revenue increased to million in from million in the increase in is primarily due to increased revenue of million and million generated by our hearing loss and balance disorders and foot and mouth disease programs  respectively 
we entered into a collaboration agreement with novartis in january  which accounted for million and million of revenue in and  respectively  and a development agreement related to the supply of clinical trial material related to activities under the collaboration agreement in august  which accounted for million and million in revenue in and  respectively 
work scope under the two novartis agreements 
table of contents resulted in increased revenue in as compared to increased revenue associated with our foot and mouth disease program is due mainly to an increase in work scope under our agreements with the dhs 
partially offsetting the increased revenue associated with our hearing loss and balance disorders and foot and mouth disease programs is decreased revenue of million associated with our hiv program as compared to the prior year periods due to reduced work scope 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in in we experienced lower research and development costs than in the comparable prior year period due primarily to closure of the pact trial 
decreased manufacturing costs in the hearing program and reduced license costs also contributed to reduced expenses 
these decreases were partially offset by increased manufacturing costs for our fmd program and supply costs for our hearing  government funded  and research programs as compared to the comparable period in stock based compensation expense included in research and development personnel costs decreased approximately  in as compared to the prior year 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in general and administrative expenses were lower in primarily due to lower professional service  license  and personnel costs 
administrative personnel costs includes a decrease of approximately  of severance expenses as compared to  and a decrease of approximately  of stock based compensation expense in as compared to the prior year 
other income loss total other income decreased to  in as compared to  in interest income  net of change in fair value of warrants was  in as compared to  in the comparable prior year period 
the decrease was mainly due to the change in the fluctuation of the fair value of the warrant liability associated with our committed equity financing facility ceff with kingsbridge capital ltd 
kingsbridge in as compared to other income loss was  in as compared to  in in  we received a grant in the amount of  under the qualifying therapeutic discovery project program under d of the internal revenue code code 
this income was partially offset by the write down of shelf registration costs of  in associated with the shelf registration statement 
results of operations years ended december  and revenue revenue 
revenue increased to million in from million in the increase in is primarily due to increased revenue of million generated by our hearing loss and balance disorders program 
we entered into a collaboration agreement with novartis in january  which accounted for million of revenue in  and a development agreement related to the supply of clinical trial material related to activities under the collaboration agreement in august  which accounted for million in revenue in the two novartis agreements resulted in increased revenue in as compared to when the only work performed for our hearing loss and balance disorders program was performed under a grant from the university of kansas 
partially offsetting the increased revenue associated with our hearing loss and balance disorders program is decreased revenue of million and million associated with our hiv and fmd programs  respectively  as compared to the prior year periods due to reduced work scope under each program 

table of contents operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease is primarily due to lower costs related to the development of tnferade including personnel  manufacturing and materials costs  patient and data management costs  and professional service costs related to our tnferade pact trial  due to the termination of the clinical trial in the first quarter of stock based compensation expense included in research and development increased  in as compared to the prior year 
research and development personnel costs includes no severance expenses for former employees in  a decrease of approximately  as compared to general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in general and administrative expenses were higher in primarily due to higher professional service cost and facility costs  partially offset by lower depreciation costs 
administrative personnel costs includes severance expenses of approximately  in for former employees  an increase of approximately  as compared to  and an increase of approximately  of stock based compensation expense in as compared to the prior year

this income was partially offset by the write down of shelf registration costs of  in associated with the shelf registration statement 
the loss in resulted primarily from the expensing of the remaining  of deferred financing charges when our ceff expired on march   partially offset by miscellaneous discounts and interest payments received from the government associated with late payments 
liquidity and capital resources we have experienced significant losses since our inception 
as of december  we have an accumulated deficit of million 
the process of developing and commercializing our product candidates requires significant research and development work and clinical trial work  as well as significant manufacturing and process development efforts 
these activities  together with our general and administrative expenses  are expected to continue to result in significant operating losses for the foreseeable future 
as of december   cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments totaled million as compared to million at december  for the months ended december   we used net cash of million for operating activities 
this included a net loss for the period of million  which included approximately million of non cash depreciation and amortization and million of non cash stock based compensation expenses 
also contributing to use of cash was the recognition of previously received unearned revenue of million 
net cash was used primarily for the advancement of our hearing program  research and development programs  and the termination of our tnferade pact trial and to a lesser extent general and administrative activities 
net cash used in investing activities during the months ended december  was million which included million for the net purchase of marketable securities and million for the purchase of property and equipment

payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years in thousands operating leases   historically we have entered into agreements with academic medical institutions and contract research organizations to perform research and development activities and with clinical sites for the treatment of patients under clinical protocols 
such contracts expire at various dates and have differing renewal and expiration clauses 
we also utilize different financing instruments  such as debt and capital and or operating leases  to finance various equipment and facility needs 
in february  we filed a million shelf registration statement on form s the shelf registration statement  with the securities and exchange commission 
the shelf registration was declared effective february  and allowed us to obtain financing through the issuance of any combination of common stock  preferred stock  warrants  or debt securities 
on june   pursuant to the shelf registration statement  we completed a registered direct offering to various investors of  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
proceeds of this offering  net of offering costs  totaled million

table of contents on february   pursuant to the shelf registration statement  we completed a registered direct offering to various investors of  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
the shares of common stock and warrants were offered in units consisting of one share of common stock and warrants to purchase one share of common stock at a per unit price of 
the warrants  which have a term of five years and an exercise price of per share  have been valued using the black scholes pricing model as of the closing date and have been accounted for in permanent equity 
the estimated fair market value of the warrants at the date of issuance was million 
proceeds of this offering  net of offering costs  totaled million 
the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the remaining warrants have been registered on the shelf registration statement 
there have been no warrants exercised since they were issued 
on february   we filed with the securities and exchange commission a million shelf registration statement on form s  which we later amended on may  the shelf registration statement 
the shelf registration statement was declared effective may  and allows us to issue any combination of common stock  preferred stock  or warrants to purchase common stock or preferred stock 
on january  we entered into a research collaboration and license agreement with novartis to discover and develop novel treatments for hearing loss and balance disorders 
under the terms of the agreement  we licensed the world wide rights to our preclinical hearing loss and balance disorders program to novartis 
concurrent with entry into the agreement with novartis  we sold  shares of our common stock to novartis pharma ag in a private placement for per share of common stock  which represents an aggregate purchase price of approximately million and was calculated based on the average of the closing price for the common stock on the nasdaq global market for the consecutive trading days ending on the fifth trading day prior to the sale of the shares 
the purchase of the shares of common stock by novartis pharma ag was undertaken in partial consideration for the rights granted under the research collaboration and license agreement 
due to the pricing formula used in the sale of the common stock  a discount of approximately million has been recorded against the upfront license payment and the value of stock associated with this sale is recorded in equity at million 
on may   we received a notice from the nasdaq stock market nasdaq stating that the minimum bid price of our common stock was below per share for consecutive business days and that we were therefore not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing set forth in marketplace rule the notification letter stated that we would be afforded until november  to regain compliance 
in order to obtain additional time to seek to regain compliance  we transferred our common stock to the nasdaq capital market effective november  on november   nasdaq notified us that we would have an additional days  or until may   to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirements 
to regain compliance  the closing bid price of our common stock was required to meet or exceed per share for at least ten consecutive business days prior to may  as a result of the reverse stock split  described below  the bid price of our common stock increased  and on may   nasdaq notified us that we regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement 
on april   the company effected a reverse stock split of its outstanding common stock at a ratio of one for ten  whereby each ten shares of common stock were combined into one share of common stock the reverse stock split 
the reverse stock split was authorized by our stockholders at a special meeting of stockholders held on april  the reverse stock split was effective with respect to stockholders of record at the close of business on april   and trading of our common stock on the nasdaq capital market began on a split adjusted basis on april  as a result of the reverse stock split  each ten shares of common stock were combined into one share of common stock and the total number of shares of common stock outstanding was reduced from approximately million shares to approximately million shares 
stockholders received cash in lieu of fractional shares produced by the reverse stock split 
all numbers in this annual report have been revised to reflect the reverse stock split  the principal effects of which were to reduce the number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding by a factor of  
table of contents increase the per share exercise price by a factor of  and decrease the number of shares issuable upon exercise by a factor of  for all outstanding options  warrants and other convertible or exercisable equity instruments entitling the holders to purchase shares of the company s common stock  and proportionately reduce the number of shares authorized and reserved for issuance under the company s existing equity compensation plans 
on september   the company s prior stockholder rights agreement expired 
in august  the company s board of directors adopted a new stockholder rights agreement between the company and american stock transfer trust company  llc  as rights agent  to be effective on september  upon expiration of the prior stockholder rights agreement 
the new stockholder rights agreement was not adopted in response to any specific effort to acquire control of the company 
in connection with the adoption of the new stockholder rights agreement  the company s board of directors declared a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right  or right  for each outstanding share of common stock to stockholders of record as of the close of business on september  initially  the rights will be represented by genvec s common stock certificates or book entry notations  will not be traded separately from the common stock and will not be exercisable 
in the event that any person acquires beneficial ownership of or more of the outstanding shares of genvec s common stock  or upon the occurrence of certain other events  each holder of a right  other than the acquirer  would be entitled to receive  upon payment of the purchase price  which is initially set at per right  a number of shares of genvec common stock having a value equal to two times such purchase price 
the company s board of directors is entitled to redeem the rights at per right at any time before a person or group has acquired or more of the company s common stock 
the rights will expire on september   subject to the company s right to extend such date  unless earlier redeemed or exchanged by the company or terminated 
the rights will at no time have any voting rights 
the company has authorized  shares of series b junior participating preferred stock in connection with the adoption of the new stockholder rights agreement 
there was no series b junior participating preferred stock issued or outstanding as of december  our estimated future capital requirements are uncertain and could change materially as a result of many factors  including the progress of our research  development  clinical  manufacturing  and commercialization activities 
we currently estimate we will average using approximately million of cash per quarter for the next four quarters ending december  our estimate includes approximately million in contractual obligations reflected in the table above  as well as million for capital expenditures 
based on this estimate we have sufficient resources to fund our operations through at least december  our business strategy is focused on entering into collaborative arrangements with third parties to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which proprietary products or indications  if any  will be subject to future collaborative arrangements in whole or in part  and how such arrangements would affect our development plan or capital requirements 
if we seek strategic alliances  licenses  or other alternative arrangements  such as arrangements with collaborative partners or others  we may need to relinquish rights to certain of our existing or future technologies  product candidates  or products we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize on our own  or to license the rights to our technologies  product candidates  or products on terms that are not favorable to us 
we also will continue to look for government sponsored research collaborations and grants to help offset future anticipated losses from operations  as we expect to continue to rely on government funding for a significant portion of our revenues for the next few years and  to a lesser extent  interest income 
if we are unable to advance the development of our product candidates through collaborations  or if our current operating capital is not sufficient to fund our operations  we may need to access the capital markets for financing or enter into strategic alliances or licensing arrangements 
if we determine to pursue and are successful in raising additional funds through the issuance of equity securities  investors will likely experience dilution  or the equity securities may have rights  preferences  or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
if we raise funds through the issuance of debt securities  those securities would have rights  preferences  and privileges senior to those of our common stock

cash and cash equivalents million short term investments million our exposure to market risk is confined to cash and cash equivalents  which consist of instruments having original maturities of three months or less  and our short term investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital until it is required to fund operations while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
our cash flow and earnings are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates in our investment portfolio 
we maintain a short term investment portfolio of investment grade government agency notes  corporate stock  and corporate bonds 
the securities in our short term investment portfolio are not leveraged  are classified as available for sale  and are subject to minimal interest rate risk  due to their predominantly short term nature 
these securities  classified as available for sale  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss included in stockholders equity 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure on our investment portfolio 
while we do not believe an increase in market rates of interest would have any significant negative impact on the realizable value of our investment portfolio  changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our investments and  therefore  impact our cash flow and results of operations
