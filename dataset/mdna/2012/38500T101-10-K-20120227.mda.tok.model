table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this report  and in particular this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of please see the cautionary language at the very beginning of this annual report on form k regarding the identification and risks relating to forward looking statements  as well as part i  item a risk factors in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and supplementary data as set out in part ii item of this annual report on form k 
overview we are an independent international energy company incorporated in the united states and engaged in oil and natural gas acquisition  exploration  development and production 
our operations are carried out in south america in colombia  argentina  peru  and brazil  and we are headquartered in calgary  alberta  canada 
our reportable segments are colombia  argentina and peru 
brazil is not a reportable segment because the level of activity in brazil is not significant at this time 
for the year ended december   colombia generated  of our revenue and other income 
as of december   we had estimated proved reserves nar of mmboe  comprising oil and natural gas  of which were proved developed reserves 
our primary source of liquidity is cash generated from our operations 
on march   we completed the acquisition of all the issued and outstanding common shares and warrants of petrolifera petroleum limited petrolifera pursuant to the terms and conditions of an arrangement agreement dated january  petrolifera is a calgary based oil  natural gas and ngl exploration  development and production company active in argentina  colombia and peru 
on june   we completed the acquisition of a participating interest in four blocks in brazil 
the agreement had an effective date of september  purchase consideration totalled million 
with the exception of one block which has a producing well  the remaining blocks are unproved properties 
in september  we announced two farm in agreements with statoil do brasil ltda 
statoil in a joint venture with petr leobrasileiro sa petrobras  in brazil s deepwater offshore camamu almada basin  subject to obtaining regulatory approval from ag ncia nacional de petr leo  g s natural e biocombust veis anp 
anp approval for the block bm cal farmout agreement was received in first quarter of the anp has announced the stat bas exploration well has been completed after reaching a total measured depth of  meters 
contractually  gran tierra is restricted from discussing well results 
in accordance with the terms of the farmout agreement  we gave notice to statoil that we will not enter into and assume our share of the work obligations of the second exploration period of block bm cal as a result the farmout agreement for bm cal has been terminated and we will not receive any interest in bm cal inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations in the three years ended december  and is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations in the future 
the price of oil is a critical factor to our business and the price of oil has historically been volatile 
volatility could be detrimental to our financial performance 
during  the average price realized for our oil was per barrel  
business strategy our plan is to continue to build an international oil and gas company through acquisition and exploitation of under developed prospective oil and gas assets  and to develop these assets with exploration and development drilling to grow commercial reserves and production 
our initial focus is in select countries in south america  currently colombia  argentina  peru  and brazil  we will consider other regions for future growth should those regions make strategic and commercial sense in creating additional value 
we have applied a two stage approach to growth  initially establishing a base of production  development and exploration assets by selective acquisitions  and secondly achieving additional reserve and production growth through drilling 
we intend to duplicate this business model in other areas as opportunities arise 
we pursue opportunities in countries with proven petroleum systems  attractive royalty  taxation and other fiscal terms  and stable legal systems

production represents production volumes nar adjusted for inventory changes 
funds flow from operations is a non gaap measure which does not have any standardized meaning prescribed under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap 
management uses this financial measure to analyze operating performance and the income generated by our principal business activities prior to the consideration of how non cash items affect that income  and believes that this financial measure is also useful supplemental information for investors to analyze operating performance and our financial results 
investors should be cautioned that this measure should not be construed as an alternative to net income or other measures of financial performance as determined in accordance with gaap 
our method of calculating this measure may differ from other companies and  accordingly  it may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies

table of contents operational highlights for the year ended december  in  oil and natural gas production  nar and inventory adjustments  averaged  boepd  an increase of over the increase was due to improved production from the moqueta  jilguero and juanambu fields  production from petrolifera and the reduced impact of pipeline interruptions 
production nar from petrolifera s properties during was  boepd 
estimated proved oil and ngl reserves  nar  as of december   were mmbbl  a increase from the estimated proved reserves as at december  the increase was due primarily to positive technical revisions to costayaco reserves based on reservoir performance  the drilling of additional appraisal wells in the moqueta field  the inclusion of proved reserves associated with the petrolifera acquisition and the working interest in block acquired in brazil  which more than offset oil production 
estimated probable and possible oil and ngl reserves  nar  as of december  were mmbbl and mmbbl  respectively 
estimated proved gas reserves  nar  as of december   were bcf compared with bcf as at december  the increase was due to the acquisition of petrolifera 
at december   of proved gas reserves were in the sierra nevada block and were in the puesto morales blocks  both of which were acquired in the petrolifera acquisition 
estimated probable and possible gas reserves  nar  as of december  were bcf and bcf  respectively 
colombia in the moqueta field in the chaza block  the moqueta delineation well was successfully completed and confirmed additional oil bearing reservoirs 
we completed two additional development wells in the moqueta field moqueta and moqueta construction of the moqueta to costayaco pipeline was completed with transportation of first oil production from moqueta commencing in june of a parallel four inch gas line was completed that will be used to transport gas from costayaco to moqueta for anticipated gas injection for pressure support 
in the costayaco field  we completed three development wells 
in the guayuyaco and garibay blocks  the juanambu and jilguero development wells were completed as producing wells and the melero exploration well was completed and resulted in an oil discovery 
we entered into a farmout agreement with cepsa colombia sa cepsac  a wholly owned subsidiary of compa ia espa ola de petr leos sa we will earn a non operated working interest in the llanos block cepsac will retain and operatorship and cepsac will farm in for a working interest on the piedemonte norte block 
under the terms of the farm in agreements  in addition to the swap of the working interest in piedemonte norte block  we will pay million towards historical costs and a partial carry on the current well being drilled 
the completion of the transfer is subject to approval by colombia s agencia nacional de hidrocarburos national hydrocarbons agency anh 
our partner began drilling the ramiriqui oil exploration well in the fourth quarter of we drilled exploration wells on the chaza block  the magdalena block  the piedemonte sur block and the rumiyaco block all of which were plugged and abandoned 
argentina we completed drilling the first of four new development wells in the puesto morales block  with the purpose of improving recovery and growing production from this mature oil field 
we completed workovers on wells  with successful results 
we also drilled and completed two producing development wells on the puesto morales este block 
our partner drilled four exploration wells in the rinconada norte block which resulted in new discoveries of oil  one of which tested  boe gross per day 
a wholly owned subsidiary of america petrogas inc is the operator of the rinconada norte block with a working interest  while we hold a non operated working interest 
we successfully farmed out a interest in the santa victoria block in the noroeste basin of northwestern argentina to apache corporation apache in march peru in january  perupetro signed the assignment documents for block  officially transferring of the block to us 
a drilling location has been identified for the first exploration well on block  with civil construction initiated in the third quarter of in september  we acquired a non operated working interest in conocophillips operated block  block and block  subject to government approval 
the approval for these blocks was granted in march with final assignment completed in april we subsequently relinquished our interest in block we drilled the kanatari exploration well on block which was plugged and abandoned and subsequently relinquished our interest in blocks and brazil on june   we received final approvals for the acquisition of a participating interest in blocks   and in the onshore rec ncavo basin of brazil and also became the operator of these fields effective from that date 
we drilled two gross exploration wells on block and block and spud a delineation well on block we announced two farm in agreements with statoil in a joint venture with petrobras  in brazil s deepwater offshore camamu almada basin 
the anp has announced the stat bas exploration well has been completed after reaching a total measured depth of  meters 
contractually  we are restricted from discussing well results 
in accordance with the terms of the farmout agreement  we gave notice to statoil that we will not enter into and assume our share of the work obligations of the second exploration period on one of the two blocks and as a result the farmout agreement for this block was terminated 
anp approval was received for the second block in the first quarter of 
table of contents financial highlights for the year ended december  revenue and other income increased by to million in compared with million in due to increased production and higher oil prices 
average prices realized per boe in were  an increase of compared with in net income grew by from the prior year to million  representing basic net income per share of and diluted net income per share of 
this compares with net income of million  or per share basic and per share diluted  in the increase in net income was the result of increased oil and natural gas sales  a million gain on the petrolifera acquisition and the absence of foreign exchange losses  partially offset by a million impairment loss in the peru cost center  a million impairment loss in the argentina cost center  a colombian equity tax of million and increased operating  dd a and general and administrative g a expenses 
the equity tax is assessed every four years 
funds flow from operations increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to increased oil and natural gas sales and improved oil prices as compared with the prior year  partially offset by a colombian equity tax and increased operating and g a expenses in cash and cash equivalents was million at december  compared with million at december  the change in cash and cash equivalents during was primarily the result of million of capital expenditures offset by funds flow from operations of million and a decrease in non cash working capital of million during working capital including cash and cash equivalents was million at december   which is a million decrease from december   due mainly to a million increase in taxes payable due to increased taxable income in colombia and a million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  partially offset by a million increase in accounts receivable due to increased sales and a million increase in taxes receivable 
the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities is a result of operations acquired in the petrolifera acquisition  the commencement of operations in brazil and increased royalty payables as a result of increased production and higher realized prices 
the increase in taxes receivable primarily relates to an increase in vat receivable as a result of increased capital expenditures 
property  plant and equipment at december  was billion  an increase of million from december   as a result of the million work program capital expenditures  million of additions from the petrolifera acquisition and million of asset retirement obligations  partially offset by million of dd a expenses 
business combination on march   we completed the acquisition of all the issued and outstanding common shares and warrants of petrolifera pursuant to the terms and conditions of an arrangement agreement dated january  petrolifera is a calgary based oil  natural gas and ngl exploration  development and production company active in argentina  colombia and peru 
for further details reference should be made to note of the consolidated financial statements 
the acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method  with gran tierra being the acquirer  whereby petrolifera s assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their fair values as at the acquisition date and the results of petrolifera were consolidated with those of gran tierra from that date 
the following table shows the allocation of the consideration transferred based on the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired thousands of us dollars consideration transferred common shares issued net of share issue costs replacement warrants allocation of consideration transferred oil and gas properties proved unproved other long term assets net working capital including cash acquired of million and accounts receivable of million asset retirement obligation bank debt other long term liabilities gain on acquisition as indicated in the allocation of the consideration transferred  the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeded the fair value of the consideration transferred 
consequently  we reassessed the recognition and measurement of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed and concluded that all acquired assets and assumed liabilities were recognized and that the valuation procedures and resulting measures were appropriate 
as a result  we recognized a gain on acquisition of million in the consolidated statement of operations 
the gain reflects the impact on petrolifera s pre acquisition market value resulting from their lack of liquidity and capital resources required to maintain current production and reserves and further develop and explore their inventory of prospects 

table of contents production from the petrolifera properties from the acquisition date to december  amounted to  boepd nar with oil and natural gas sales of million 
for the post acquisition period  petrolifera recorded an after tax loss of million 
business environment outlook our revenues have been significantly impacted by the continuing fluctuations in oil prices 
oil prices are volatile and unpredictable and are influenced by concerns about financial markets and the impact of the worldwide economy on oil demand growth 
however  based on projected production  prices  costs and our current liquidity position  we believe that our current operations and capital expenditure program can be maintained from cash flow from existing operations and cash on hand  barring unforeseen events or a severe downturn in oil and gas prices 
should our operating cash flow decline  we would examine measures such as reducing our capital expenditure program  issuance of debt  disposition of assets  or issuance of equity 
the continuing uncertainty regarding the middle east and libya and continued economic instability in the united states and europe is having an impact on world markets  and we are unable to determine the impact  if any  these events may have on oil prices and demand 
our future growth and acquisitions may depend on our ability to raise additional funds through equity and debt markets 
should we be required to raise debt or equity financing to fund capital expenditures or other acquisition and development opportunities  such funding may be affected by the market value of our common stock 
if the price of our common stock declines  our ability to utilize our stock to raise capital may be negatively affected 
also  raising funds by issuing stock or other equity securities would further dilute our existing shareholders  and this dilution would be exacerbated by a decline in our stock price 
any securities we issue may have rights  preferences and privileges that are senior to our existing equity securities 
borrowing money may also involve further pledging of some or all of our assets and will expose us to interest rate risk 
depending on the currency used to borrow money  we may also be exposed to further foreign exchange risk 
our ability to borrow money and the interest rate we pay for any money we borrow will be affected by market conditions  and we cannot predict what price we may pay for any borrowed money

oil and ngl production  nar and inventory changes  in increased to mmbbl  a improvement compared with mmbbl in the increase was due to improved production from the moqueta  jilguero and juanambu fields  production from petrolifera and the reduced impact of pipeline interruptions 
petrolifera s oil and ngl production for the period since the acquisition date  nar  was mmbbl 
production during the first quarter of was adversely affected by a maintenance program at the tumaco port offloading terminal between december  and february  which reduced sales through the ecopetrol operated trans andean oil pipeline the ota pipeline 
during  sections of the ota pipeline were damaged  which temporarily reduced our deliveries to ecopetrol for days

equity tax represents a colombian tax of on a legislated measure which is based on our colombian segment s balance sheet equity at january  the equity tax is assessed every four years 
the financial instruments gain primarily relates to the fair value assigned to warrants issued in connection with the acquisition of petrolifera 
these warrants expired unexercised during august 
table of contents the gain on acquisition of million in relates to the acquisition of petrolifera 
this gain reflects the impact on petrolifera s pre acquisition market value of its lack of liquidity and capital resources required to maintain production and reserves and further develop and explore its inventory of prospects 
there were essentially no foreign exchange gains in as a result of an unrealized non cash foreign exchange gain of million being offset by realized foreign exchange losses 
the non cash foreign exchange gain primarily relates to the translation of deferred tax liabilities 
this compares to a foreign exchange loss of million recorded in  of which million was an unrealized non cash foreign exchange loss 
under gaap  deferred taxes are considered a monetary liability and require translation from local currency to us dollar functional currency at each balance sheet date 
this translation results in the recognition of unrealized exchange losses or gains 
the colombian peso devalued by against the us dollar in the year ended december  resulting in an unrealized foreign exchange gain which was offset by realized foreign exchange losses 
in  the colombian peso strengthened against the us dollar by 
income tax expense for was million compared with million in this represents an increase of  primarily as a result of higher net income in colombia 
for the year ended december   the effective income tax rate was compared with in due to a decrease in non taxable foreign currency translation adjustments and the non taxable gain on acquisition in  partially offset by an increase in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets mainly in peru 
the variance in the effective tax rates compared with the us statutory rate is attributable to the same factors and other permanent differences 
our capital expenditures during were million after changes in non cash working capital and net of proceeds from disposition of oil and gas properties representing a significant increase from capital expenditures in of million 
in  we made capital expenditures included drilling and acquisition expenditures of million  facilities expenses of million  geological and geophysical expenses of million and other expenditures of million 
additionally  we had million of additions to property  plant and equipment from the petrolifera acquisition 
consolidated results of operations for the year ended december  compared with the results for the year ended december  net income of million  or per share basic and per share diluted  was recorded in compared with million  or per share basic and per share diluted  in a increase in revenue and other income to million from million recorded in was partially offset by an million increase in operating expenses  a million increase in g a expenses  a million increase in dd a  and a million increase in income tax expense 
revenue and other income increased as a result of a increase in oil production combined with a improvement in oil prices 
oil and ngl production  nar  in increased to mmbbl compared with mmbbl in  due to increased production from our colombia operations 
average realized oil prices for increased to per barrel from per barrel in  reflecting higher wti oil prices 
the additional government royalty for the costayaco field described in segmented operations colombia began in the fourth quarter of and was paid for only three months of versus the full year of as a result  our share of production was reduced by a total of  boe s relating to this additional royalty in as compared with only  boe in since our production volumes are reported nar and this royalty structure was not in place for an equal amount of time in and  certain changes between these years  including volumes  changes in per boe operating costs  and per boe general and administrative costs  are not readily comparable 
for instance  the increase in the costayaco field production does not appear as high in comparison with as it would appear without the additional royalty volumes deducted 
similarly  the per boe operating and g a expenses appear higher on a per boe basis in than in as the costs are divided over a smaller base after royalties are deducted 
operating expenses for amounted to million  a increase from the prior year total of million 
the increase in operating expenses occurred primarily in colombia and was due to an enhanced workover program related to the costayaco area  an increase in transportation costs related to increased production and pipeline maintenance  and an increase in producing wells in costayaco 
operating expenses on a boe basis in were  a increase from reflecting both the increase in total operating costs and the effect of the additional government royalty payable on per boe calculations  partially offset by an increase in production 
dd a expenses for increased to million compared with million in the increase in production levels was partially offset by an increase of reserves at year end and a reduction of future development costs included in the depletable base as compared with dd a expenses in included a million ceiling test impairment for our argentina cost center  of which million related to the abandonment of the gte 
st 
vmor sidetrack operations  as compared with a million charge in on a boe basis  dd a in was compared with for  representing a increase resulting from the ceiling test impairment loss offset partially by increased reserves and decreased future development costs 
g a expenses of million for were higher than due to increased employee related costs reflecting the expansion of operations in peru  brazil  and colombia and higher business development costs 
g a expenses per boe increased to per boe compared with per boe for the increase in g a expenses on a per boe basis over the prior year was compounded by the additional royalty paid in the foreign exchange loss of million for  of which million is an unrealized non cash foreign exchange loss  compares to million recorded in  of which million is an unrealized non cash foreign exchange loss 
these losses originate in colombia and relate to foreign exchange losses resulting from the translation of a deferred tax liability 
income tax expense for amounted to million compared with million recorded in this represents an increase of in annual income tax expense  primarily as a result of higher profits and the application of a valuation allowance against previously recognized deferred tax assets associated with argentina 
the decrease in the effective tax rate to from in is primarily due to a decrease in the valuation allowance associated with losses in our us  canadian  peru and brazil business units  partially offset by the increase in the valuation allowance associated with losses in our argentina business units 
the variance from the us statutory rate for results from foreign currency translation losses that are neither taxable nor deductible for tax purposes in each of the respective jurisdictions  the valuation allowances as described above  enhanced tax depreciation incentive in colombia  and colombia third party royalty payments that are not deductible for tax purposes 
similar factors cause the variance from the us statutory rate for estimated oil and gas reserves estimated proved oil and ngl reserves  nar  as of december   were mmbbl  a increase from the estimated proved reserves as at december  the increase was due to the acquisition of petrolifera which had reserves in argentina and colombia  positive technical revisions to costayaco reserves based on reservoir performance  the drilling of additional appraisal wells in the moqueta field and the acquisition of a working interest in block in brazil  which more than offset oil production 
estimated probable and possible oil and ngl reserves  nar  as of december  were mmbbl and mmbbl  respectively 

table of contents estimated proved gas reserves  nar  as of december   were bcf compared with bcf at december  the increase was due to the acquisition of petrolifera 
at december   of proved gas reserves were in the sierra nevada block and were in the puesto morales blocks  both of which were acquired in the petrolifera acquisition 
estimated probable and possible gas reserves  nar  as of december  were bcf and bcf  respectively 
estimated proved oil and ngl reserves  nar  as of december   were mmbbl  a increase from the estimated proved reserves as at december  the increase was generated by our colombian operations and resulted from our exploration success in moqueta and from sustained reservoir performance in costayaco  which led to conversion of probable reserves to proved reserves and which more than offset production of oil

estimated proved gas reserves  nar  as of december   were bcf  a decrease from the estimated proved reserves as at december  estimated probable and possible gas reserves  nar  as of december  were bcf and bcf  respectively 
work program and capital expenditure program in december  we announced the details of our capital program 
we have planned a capital budget of million  including million for colombia  million for brazil  million for argentina  million for peru and million associated with corporate activities 
of this  million is for drilling  million is for facilities  equipment and pipelines and million is for geological and geophysical g g expenditures 
of the million allocated to drilling  approximately million is for exploration  and the balance is for delineation and development drilling 
we expect that our committed and discretionary capital program will be funded from cash flow from operations and cash on hand 
our work program is intended to create both growth and value through strategic acquisitions of working interests  by leveraging existing assets to increase reserves and production levels and through the construction of pipelines and facilities in the areas with proved reserves 
we are financing our capital program through cash flows from operations and cash on hand  while retaining financial flexibility with a strong cash position and no debt  so that we can be positioned to undertake further development opportunities and to pursue value add acquisitions 
however  as a result of the nature of the oil and natural gas exploration  development and exploitation industry  budgets are regularly reviewed with respect to both the success of expenditures and other opportunities that become available 
accordingly  while we currently intend that funds will be expended as set forth in our work program  there may be circumstances where  for sound business reasons  actual expenditures may in fact differ 
excluding potential exploration success  production in is expected to range between  and  boepd nar

in  production of oil and ngls  nar  increased by to mmbbl compared with mmbbl in the increase in production is primarily due to the development of the moqueta field with six producing wells  the commencement of production in the garibay block from the jilguero and wells and increased production in the guayuyaco block from the new well juanambu and a full year of production from juanambu production from the costayaco field was consistent with the prior year 
production from two new wells  costayaco and  was offset by the effects of reservoir management intended to slow production declines 
production during the first quarter of was adversely affected by a maintenance program at the tumaco port offloading terminal between december  and february  which reduced sales through the ota pipeline 
during  sections of the ota pipeline were damaged  which temporarily reduced our deliveries to ecopetrol for days days in june and days in september 
as a result of achieving gross field production of five mmbbl in our costayaco field in the fourth quarter of  we are subject to an additional government royalty payable 
this royalty is calculated on of field production revenue over an inflation adjusted trigger point 
that trigger point for costayaco oil was for production revenue for this calculation is based on production volumes net of other government royalty volumes 
average government royalties at costayaco with gross production of  barrels of oil per day and wti price per barrel are approximately  including the additional government royalty of approximately 
the anh sliding scale royalty at  barrels of oil per day is approximately and this royalty is deductible prior to calculating the additional government royalty 
revenue and other income in increased by to million compared with oil and natural gas sales were positively impacted by higher net realized oil prices in and increased production

operating expenses for the year ended december  increased to million  or per boe  from million  or per boe in operating expenses per boe were higher in due to long term testing and slickline service costs partially offset by reduced transportation and workover costs 
significant long term testing costs were incurred at jilguero and slickline service costs at costayaco and moqueta 
transportation costs were lower than the prior year due to lower trucking costs as a result of the reduced impact of pipeline disruptions and pipeline pumping optimization 
workover costs were lower than the prior year mainly due to fewer workovers in the chaza block 
petrolifera s operating expenses for the post acquisition period were million

the additional government royalty paid in discussed above reduced the increase in total production from the costayaco field as compared with the prior year 
our colombian operating results for the year ended december  were principally driven by the increase in production volumes and the associated increase in workover  transportation  operating  g a and dd a expenses 
in  colombia production included costayaco       january  and june  juanambu and  and the santana block 
in  colombia production included costayaco  july  september  and juanambu outages on the ota pipeline result when sections of the pipeline are damaged 
outages reduced our deliveries to ecopetrol for days in days in june and days in september  as compared with days in days in july and august and days in june 
in january  the juanambu and costayaco fields were also shut in for days due to a general strike in the region where our operations are located 
the overall decrease in sales as a result of the disruptions is estimated to be approximately of total sales in and of total sales in revenue and interest were positively affected by an increase in net realized oil prices in compared with the average net realized prices for oil  which are based on wti prices  increased by to per barrel for the year ended december  compared with increased production combined with the increased net realized oil price resulted in our revenue and interest from colombia for the year ended december  increasing by to million from levels 
as a result of achieving gross field production of five million barrels in our costayaco field during the month of september  we became subject to an additional government royalty payable 
the additional royalty is calculated on of the field production revenue over an inflation adjusted trigger point 
that trigger point was for and for production revenue for this calculation is based on production volumes net of other government royalty volumes 
in  the actual government royalties at costayaco averaged including the additional government royalty of 
in  the government royalties for the year averaged  including the additional government royalty  once it became effective september operating expenses for the year ended december  increased to million from million in the increased operating expenses resulted from the costayaco workover program million higher than in  increased trucking resulting from increased volumes and ota pipeline maintenance  and an increase in producing wells in costayaco for on a per boe basis  operating expenses for increased to compared with incurred in  reflecting higher operating costs partially offset by the effect of the increase in total production 
the additional government royalty paid in as compared with further increased the per boe operating cost amounts from for  dd a expenses increased to million from million in increased production levels partially offset by higher oil reserve levels and lower future development costs added to the depletable base  accounted for the increase in dd a expenses 
on a per boe basis  dd a expenses in colombia decreased by to for  compared with for  due to higher production offset by increased proved reserves and lower future development costs 
higher g a expenses incurred to manage the increased level of development and operating activities resulted in g a expense increasing to million for the year ended december  from million incurred in on a per boe basis  g a expenses in increased by to from in  due to higher costs partially offset by higher production 
the additional government royalty paid in as compared with further increased the per boe g a amounts from the foreign exchange loss of million for the year ended december  includes an unrealized non cash foreign exchange loss of million and compares to a foreign exchange loss of million in  including an unrealized non cash foreign exchange loss of million 
the unrealized non cash foreign exchange loss resulted primarily from the translation of a deferred tax liability recognized on the purchase of solana resources limited solana 
this deferred tax liability  a monetary liability  is denominated in the local currency of the colombian foreign operations and as a result  foreign exchange gains and losses have been calculated on conversion to the us dollar functional currency

contractual commitments have increased from december  mainly as a result of new pipeline transportation contract commitments and compressor and other operating equipment leases assumed upon the acquisition of petrolifera 
related party transactions on january   we entered into an agreement to sublease office space to a company of which our president and chief executive officer serves as an independent director 
the term of the sublease runs from february  to january  and the sublease payment is  per month plus approximately  for operating and other expenses  the terms are consistent with market conditions in the calgary  alberta  canada real estate market

pursuant to the farmout agreement  we are obligated to make payment for a certain percentage of the costs relating to block bm cal  which relate primarily to the well that was drilled during the term of the farmout agreement 
we expect to make that payment in the approximate amount of million in march critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements under gaap requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as well as the revenues and expenses reported and disclosure of contingent liabilities 
changes in these estimates related to judgments and assumptions will occur as a result of changes in facts and circumstances or discovery of new information  and  accordingly  actual results could differ from amounts estimated 
on a regular basis we evaluate our estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
certain accounting estimates are considered to be critical if a the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to changes  and b the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material 
the areas of accounting and the associated critical estimates and assumptions made are discussed below 
full cost method of accounting  proved reserves  dd a and impairments of oil and gas properties we follow the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties in accordance with us securities and exchange commission sec regulation s x rule  as described in note to our annual consolidated financial statements 
under the full cost method of accounting  all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration and development of properties are capitalized  including internal costs directly attributable to these activities 
the sum of net capitalized costs  including estimated asset retirement obligations  and estimated future development costs to be incurred in developing proved reserves are depleted using the unit of production method 
companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas exploration and development activities are required to perform a ceiling test calculation each quarter 
the ceiling test limits pooled costs to the aggregate of the discounted estimated after tax future net revenues from proved oil and gas properties  plus the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties less any associated tax effects 
if our net book value of oil and gas properties  less related deferred income taxes  is in excess of the calculated ceiling  the excess must be written off as an expense 
any such write down will reduce earnings in the period of occurrence and result in lower dd a expenses in future periods 
the ceiling limitation is imposed separately for each country in which we have oil and gas properties 
an expense recorded in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent period even though higher oil and gas prices may have increased the ceiling applicable to the subsequent period 
our estimates of proved oil and gas reserves are a major component of the depletion and full cost ceiling calculations 
additionally  our proved reserves represent the element of these calculations that require the most subjective judgments 
estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering data  projected future rates of production and the amount and timing of future expenditures 
the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves requires substantial judgment  resulting in imprecise determinations  particularly for new discoveries 
different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities based on the same data 
we believe our assumptions are reasonable based on the information available to us at the time we prepare our estimates 
however  these estimates may change substantially as additional data from ongoing development activities and production performance becomes available and as economic conditions impacting oil and gas prices and costs change 

table of contents management is responsible for estimating the quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves and for preparing related disclosures 
estimates and related disclosures are prepared in accordance with sec requirements and generally accepted industry practices in the united states as prescribed by the society of petroleum engineers 
reserve estimates are audited at least annually by independent qualified reserves consultants 
while the quantities of proved reserves require substantial judgment  the associated prices of oil and natural gas  and the applicable discount rate  that are used to calculate the discounted present value of the reserves do not require judgment 
the ceiling calculation dictates that a discount factor be used and future net revenues are calculated using prices that represent the average of the first day of each month price for the month period 
therefore  the future net revenues associated with the estimated proved reserves are not based on our assessment of future prices or costs 
estimates of standardized measure of our future cash flows from proved reserves for our december  ceiling tests were based on wellhead prices as of the first day of each month within that twelve month period of for colombia  for argentina and for brazil 
because the ceiling calculation dictates the use of prices that are not representative of future prices and requires a discount factor  the resulting value should not be construed as the current market value of the estimated oil and gas reserves attributable to our properties 
historical oil and gas prices for any particular month period  can be either higher or lower than our price forecast 
therefore  oil and gas property writedowns that result from applying the full cost ceiling limitation  and that are caused by fluctuations in price as opposed to reductions to the underlying quantities of reserves  should not be viewed as absolute indicators of a reduction of the ultimate value of the related reserves 
our reserves committee oversees the annual review of our oil and gas reserves and related disclosures 
the board meets with management periodically to review the reserves process  results and related disclosures and appoints and meets with the independent reserves consultants to review the scope of their work  whether they have had access to sufficient information  the nature and satisfactory resolution of any material differences of opinion  and in the case of the independent reserves consultants  their independence 
we assessed our oil and gas properties for impairment as at december  and found no impairment write down was required based on our calculations for our colombia and brazil cost centers 
as a result of assessing oil and gas properties in our peru and argentina cost centers  ceiling test impairment losses of million and million respectively were recorded 
the impairment charge in the peru cost center related to seismic and drilling costs from dry wells on two blocks which were relinquished 
the impairment charge in the argentina cost center related to an increase in estimated future operating and capital costs to produce our remaining argentine proved reserves and a decrease in reserve volumes 
we assessed our oil and gas properties for impairment as at december  and found no impairment write down was required based on our assumptions for our colombia cost center 
a ceiling test impairment loss of million was recorded in our argentina cost centre in as a result of the abandonment of the gte 
st 
vmor sidetrack operations  an increase in estimated future operating costs to produce our remaining argentine proved reserves and a decrease in reserve volumes 
we assessed our oil and gas properties for impairment as at december  and found that an impairment write down of million was required for our argentina cost center 
because of the volatile nature of oil and gas prices  it is not possible to predict the timing or magnitude of full cost writedowns 
in addition  due to the inter relationship of the various judgments made to estimate proved reserves  it is impractical to provide quantitative analyses of the effects of potential changes in these estimates 
however  decreases in estimates of proved reserves would generally increase our depletion rate and  thus  our depletion expense 
decreases in our proved reserves may result from lower market prices  which may make it uneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost fields 
the decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of the full cost ceiling test previously discussed 
in addition  increases in costs required to develop our reserves would increase the rate at which we record dd a expenses 
unproved properties unproved properties are not depleted pending the determination of the existence of proved reserves 
costs are transferred into the amortization base on an ongoing basis as the properties are evaluated and proved reserves are established or impairment is determined 
unproved properties are evaluated quarterly to ascertain whether impairment has occurred 
unproved properties  the costs of which are individually significant  are assessed individually by considering seismic data  requirements to relinquish acreage  drilling results and activity  remaining time in the commitment period  remaining capital plans  and political  economic  and market conditions 
where it is not practicable to individually assess the amount of impairment of properties for which costs are not individually significant  these properties are grouped for purposes of assessing impairment 
during any period in which factors indicate an impairment  the cumulative costs incurred to date for such property are transferred to the full cost pool and are then subject to amortization 
the transfer of costs into the amortization base involves a significant amount of judgment and may be subject to changes over time based on our drilling plans and results  geological and geophysical evaluations  the assignment of proved reserves  availability of capital  and other factors 
for prospects where a reserve base has not yet been established  the impairment is charged to earnings 
asset retirement obligations we are required to remove or remedy the effect of our activities on the environment at our present and former operating sites by dismantling and removing production facilities and remediating any damage caused 
estimating our future asset retirement obligations aro requires us to make estimates and judgments with respect to activities that will occur many years into the future 
in addition  the ultimate financial impact of environmental laws and regulations is not always clearly known and cannot be reasonably estimated as standards evolve in the countries in which we operate 
we record aro in our consolidated financial statements by discounting the present value of the estimated retirement obligations associated with our oil and gas wells and facilities 
in arriving at amounts recorded  we make numerous assumptions and judgments with respect to the existence of a legal obligation for an aro  estimated probabilities  amounts and timing of settlements  inflation factors  credit adjusted risk free discount rates and changes in legal  regulatory  environmental and political environments 
because costs typically extend many years into the future  estimating future costs is difficult and requires management to make judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors  including changing technology and the political and regulatory environment 
in periods subsequent to initial measurement of the aro  we must recognize period to period changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows 
increases in the aro liability due to passage of time impact net income as accretion expense 
the related capitalized costs  including revisions thereto  are charged to expense through dd a 
it is difficult to determine the impact of a change in any one of our assumptions 
as a result  we are unable to provide a reasonable sensitivity analysis of the impact a change in our assumptions would have on our financial results 

table of contents allocation of consideration transferred in business combinations the acquisition of petrolifera was accounted for using the purchase method  with gran tierra being the acquirer  whereby the petrolifera assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their fair values at the acquisition date with the excess of the fair values of the net assets acquired over the consideration transferred recorded as a gain on acquisition 
calculation of fair values of assets and liabilities  which was done with the assistance of independent advisors  was subject to estimates which include various assumptions including the fair value of proved and unproved reserves of the acquired company as well as the future production and development costs and future oil and gas prices 
while these estimates of fair value for the various assets acquired and liabilities assumed have no effect on our liquidity or capital resources  they can have an effect on the future results of operations 
generally  the higher the fair value assigned to both oil and gas properties and non oil and gas properties  the lower future net income will be as a result of higher future dd a expenses 
also  a higher fair value assigned to the oil and gas properties  based on higher future estimates of oil and gas prices  will increase the likelihood of a full cost ceiling write down in the event that future oil and gas prices drop below the price forecast used to originally determine fair value 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed and we test goodwill for impairment at least annually 
the impairment test requires allocating goodwill and certain other assets and liabilities to a level of reporting referred to as a reporting unit 
we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to the net book value of the reporting unit 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the net book value  including goodwill  we would write down the goodwill to the implied fair value of the goodwill through a charge to expense 
the most significant judgments involved in estimating the fair values of our reporting units relate to the valuation of our property and equipment 
because quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units  fair values of reporting units are based upon estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit 
a lower goodwill value decreases the likelihood of an impairment charge 
however  unfavorable changes in reserves or in our price forecast would increase the likelihood of a goodwill impairment charge 
a goodwill impairment charge would have no effect on liquidity or capital resources 
however  it would adversely affect our results of operations in that period 
the goodwill on our balance sheet resulted from the solana and argosy energy international lp argosy acquisitions  and relates entirely to the colombia reporting unit 
this reporting unit is not at risk of failing the step goodwill impairment test under gaap 
the calculated fair value of the colombian reporting unit is significantly in excess of its carrying value 
differences in the our actual future cash flows  operating results  growth rates  capital expenditures  cost of capital and discount rates as compared with the estimates utilized for the purpose of calculating the fair value of each business unit  as well as a decline in our stock price and related market capitalization  could affect the results of our annual goodwill assessment and  accordingly  potentially lead to future goodwill impairment charges 
income taxes we follow the liability method of accounting for income taxes whereby we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets are also recognized for the future tax benefits attributable to the expected utilization of existing tax net operating loss carryforwards and other types of carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we carry on business in several countries and as a result  we are subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions 
the determination of our income tax provision is inherently complex and we are required to interpret continually changing regulations and make certain judgments 
while income tax filings are subject to audits and reassessments  we believe we have made adequate provision for all income tax obligations 
however  changes in facts and circumstances as a result of income tax audits  reassessments  jurisprudence and any new legislation may result in an increase or decrease in our provision for income taxes 
to assess the realization of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
our effective tax rate is based on pre tax income and the tax rates applicable to that income in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
an estimated effective tax rate for the year is applied to our quarterly operating results 
in the event that there is a significant unusual or discrete item recognized  or expected to be recognized  in our quarterly operating results  the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded at the same time as the unusual or discrete item 
we consider the resolution of prior year tax matters to be such items 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
we establish reserves when it is more likely than not that we will not realize the full tax benefit of the position 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances 
we routinely assess potential uncertain tax positions and  if required  estimate and establish accruals for such amounts 
legal and other contingencies a provision for legal and other contingencies is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
determining when expenses should be recorded for these contingencies and the appropriate amounts for accrual is a complex estimation process that includes the subjective judgment of management 
in many cases  management s judgment is based on interpretation of laws and regulations  which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or courts of law 
management closely monitors known and potential legal and other contingencies and periodically determines when we should record losses for these items based on information available to us 
stock based compensation our stock based compensation cost is measured based on the fair value of the award on the grant date 
the compensation cost is recognized net of estimated forfeitures over the requisite service period 
gaap requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 

table of contents we utilize the black scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of all of our stock options 
the use of such models requires substantial judgment with respect to expected life  volatility  expected returns and other factors 
expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock 
we use historical experience for exercises to determine expected life 
we are responsible for determining the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of our share based payment awards 
new accounting pronouncements we have reviewed all recently issued  but not yet adopted  accounting standard updates in order to determine their effects  if any  on our consolidated financial statements 
based on that review  we believe that the implementation of these standards will not materially impact our consolidated financial position  operating results  cash flows  or disclosure requirements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our principal market risk relates to oil prices 
most of our revenues are from oil sales at prices which are defined by contract relative to wti and adjusted for transportation and quality each month 
in argentina  a further discount factor which is related to a tax on oil exports establishes a common pricing mechanism for all oil produced in the country  regardless of its destination 
foreign currency risk is a factor for our company but is ameliorated to a large degree by the nature of expenditures and revenues in the countries where we operate 
we have not engaged in any formal hedging activity with regard to foreign currency risk 
our reporting currency is us dollars and essentially of our revenues are related to the us price of wti or brent oil 
in colombia  we receive of our revenues in us dollars and the majority of our capital expenditures are in us dollars 
the majority of our capital expenditures in peru are in us dollars 
in argentina and brazil  prices for oil are in us dollars  but revenues are received in local currency translated according to current exchange rates 
the majority of our capital expenditures within argentina and brazil are based on us dollar prices  but are paid in local currency translated according to current exchange rates 
the majority of local office expenditures in all locations are in local currency 
while we operate in south america exclusively  the majority of our acquisition expenditures have been valued and paid in us dollars 
additionally  unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses result from the fluctuation of the us dollar to the colombian peso due to our deferred tax liability  a monetary liability  which is mainly denominated in the local currency of the colombian foreign operations 
as a result  a foreign exchange gain or loss must be calculated on conversion to the us dollar functional currency 
a strengthening in the colombian peso against the us dollar results in foreign exchange losses  estimated at  for each one peso decrease in the exchange rate of the colombian peso to one us dollar 
we consider our exposure to interest rate risk to be immaterial 
our interest rate exposures primarily relate to our investment portfolio 
our investment objectives are focused on preservation of principal and liquidity 
by policy  we manage our exposure to market risks by limiting investments to high quality bank issues at overnight rates  or government securities of the united states or canadian federal governments such as guaranteed investment certificates or treasury bills 
a change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of our investment portfolio 
we do not hold any of these investments for trading purposes 
we do not hold equity investments  and we have no debt
