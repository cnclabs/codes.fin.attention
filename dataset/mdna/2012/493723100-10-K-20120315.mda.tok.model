three months ended march three months ended june three months ended sept 
three months ended dec 
unaudited and in thousands net income loss depreciation intangible amortization     stock compensation amortization interest expense income tax expense benefit initial public offering and acquisition costs other non recurring items adjusted ebitda     adjusted ebitda is a financial measure that is not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or us gaap 
the table above provides a reconciliation of this non us gaap financial measure to net income loss  the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with us gaap 
adjusted ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss  operating income loss or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with us gaap 
our adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other companies may not calculate adjusted ebitda or similarly titled measures in the same manner as we do 
we prepare adjusted ebitda to eliminate the impact of items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance 
we encourage you to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate 

table of contents we believe adjusted ebitda is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance for the following reasons we have various non recurring transactions and expenses that directly impact our net income 
adjusted ebitda is intended to approximate the net cash provided by operations by adjusting for non recurring  non operational items  and securities analysts use adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure to evaluate the overall operating performance of companies and we anticipate that our investor and analyst presentations after we are public will include adjusted ebitda 
our board of directors and management use adjusted ebitda as a measure of operating performance  to determine a significant portion of management s incentive compensation  for planning purposes  including the preparation of our annual operating budget  and to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies 
although adjusted ebitda is frequently used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluations of companies  adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations as reported under us gaap 
some of these limitations are adjusted ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or other contractual commitments  adjusted ebitda does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  adjusted ebitda does not reflect interest expense or interest income  adjusted ebitda does not reflect cash requirements for income taxes  adjusted ebitda does not include non cash expenses related to stock compensation  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated or amortized will often have to be replaced in the future  and adjusted ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for these replacements  and other companies in our industry may calculate adjusted ebitda or similarly titled measures differently than we do  limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure

executive level overview we provide mission critical cybersecurity and cyber superiority solutions to defense  intelligence and national security agencies 
our solutions  services and products support the collection  processing  analysis and use of intelligence data and information in the domain of cyberspace 
cyberspace is the global environment of data and information that encompasses all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum in which intelligence data may exist or transmit 
see item business for a detailed description of our business 
during  we experienced high growth  both organically and through acquisitions  as we were able to establish the company as a viable and competitive entity within our target market 
we acquired three companies during and expanded our footprint within the intelligence agency market 
at the end of  we have active contracts with of the intelligence agencies 
we intend to continue our acquisition strategy as we find the right complementary companies at the right price 
organically on a pro forma basis  we grew from as we have expanded our services platform and our products have reached the right target markets 
this growth was adversely impacted by our air force services business that declined 
table of contents million on a pro forma basis from absent this decline  organic revenue grew 
we intend to continue on a similar organic growth trajectory in and beyond 
in  keyw focused significant energy on the integration and synergy capture of our acquired companies  and while there is still some remaining progress to be made in that effort  we intend to focus much of our strategy on re accelerating our organic growth rate  winning new business  and investing in internal technology research and development initiatives to position the company for continued growth in the longer term 
a key element of this strategy is leveraging our multi int platform capabilities to further our penetration into the geospatial intelligence geoint  signals intelligence sigint  and airborne intelligence  surveillance  and reconnaissance airborne isr markets with our unique  agile  approach 
additionally  keyw will continue to look for opportunities to acquire capabilities that further enhance our overall positioning in the markets we serve 
critical accounting policies the following are the critical accounting policies that require us to make sensitive estimates and assumptions  or that regard matters where further detail will assist the reader in better understanding our business and the results of our operations 
we have additional accounting policies included in our audited financial statements contained in item of this form k 
the policies that we have included below include revenue recognition cost of revenues inventories long lived assets excluding goodwill goodwill intangibles research and development costs income taxes share based compensation revenue recognition we derive the majority of our revenue from time and materials  firm fixed price  cost plus fixed fee  and cost plus award fee contracts 
revenues from cost reimbursable contracts are recorded as reimbursable costs are incurred  including an estimated share of the applicable contractual fees earned 
for performance based fees under cost reimbursable contracts  we recognize the relevant portion of the expected fee to be awarded by the client at the time such fee can be reasonably estimated  based on factors such as prior award experience and communications with the client regarding performance 
for cost reimbursable contracts with performance based fee incentives  we recognize the relevant portion of the fee upon customer approval 
for time and materials contracts  revenue is recognized based on billable rates times hours delivered plus materials and other reimbursable costs incurred 
for fixed price production contracts  revenue and cost are recognized at a rate per unit as the units are delivered or by other methods to measure services provided 
this method of accounting requires estimating the total revenues and total contract costs of the contract 
during the performance of contracts  these estimates are periodically reviewed and revisions are made as required 
the affect on revenue and contract profit as a result of these revisions is included in the periods in which the revisions are made 
this method can result in the deferral of costs or the deferral of profit on these contracts 
because we assume the risk of performing a fixed price contract at a set price  the failure to accurately estimate ultimate costs or to control costs during performance of the work could result  and in some instances has resulted  in reduced profits or losses on such contracts 
estimated losses on contracts at completion are recognized when identified 

table of contents contract revenue recognition inherently involves estimation 
examples of estimates include the contemplated level of effort to accomplish the tasks under the contract  the cost of the effort  and an ongoing assessment of our progress toward completing the contract 
from time to time  as part of our management processes  facts develop that require us to revise our estimated total costs or revenue 
to the extent that a revised estimate affects contract profit or revenue previously recognized  we record the cumulative effect of the revision in the period in which the facts requiring the revision become known 
in certain circumstances  and based on correspondence with the end customer  management authorizes work to commence or to continue on a contract option  addition or amendment prior to the signing of formal modifications or amendments 
we recognize revenue to the extent it is probable that the formal modifications or amendments will be finalized in a timely manner and that it is probable that the revenue recognized will be collected 
all revenue is net of intercompany and intersegment adjustments 
all reported revenue belongs to the performing organization 
cost of revenues cost of revenues consists primarily of compensation expenses for program personnel  the fringe benefits associated with this compensation and other direct expenses incurred to complete programs  including cost of materials and subcontractor efforts 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost determined on a weighted average basis or market 
our inventory consists of specialty products that we manufacture on a limited quantity basis for our customers 
we manufacture at quantity levels that are projected to be sold in the six month period following production 
the company has not had any products sold below their standard pricing less applicable volume discounts 
in  we recorded an inventory reserve for certain products where the market has not developed as we expected 
long lived assets excluding goodwill the company follows the provisions of fasb asc topic  impairment or disposal of long lived assets in accounting for long lived assets such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization 
the guidance requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
an impairment loss may be indicated if the sum of the long term undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the long lived asset being evaluated 
impairment losses are measured as the difference between the carrying value of long lived assets and their fair market value based on discounted cash flows of the related assets 
impairment losses are treated as permanent reductions in the carrying amount of the assets 
the company has not recorded any impairments since inception 
goodwill purchase price in excess of the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded as goodwill 
in accordance with fasb asc topic  goodwill  the company tests for impairment at least annually  using a two step approach 
impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill  to the fair value of the reporting unit 
the company operated as a single segment at the time of our annual goodwill impairment testing 
the company began reporting in two segments at the end of a high level review of goodwill at the segment level at the end of the year did not indicate any goodwill impairment in either segment 
the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using a market capitalization approach 
if the carrying amount of the unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill is considered impaired and a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the company performed the test during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and found no impairment to the carrying value of goodwill 
management has concluded that there have been no events subsequent to the impairment test that would indicate an impairment of goodwill 

table of contents intangibles intangible assets consist of the value of customer related intangibles acquired in various acquisitions 
intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives unless the pattern of usage of the benefits indicates an alternative method is more representative 
the useful lives of the intangibles range from one to seven years 
research and development internally funded research and development expenses are expensed as incurred and are included in cost of operations in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
in accordance with fasb asc topic research and development  such costs consist primarily of payroll  material  subcontractor and an allocation of overhead costs related to product development 
research and development costs totaled   and  for years ended december   december  and december   respectively 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enacted date 
we will establish a valuation allowance if we determine that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
for a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold  the company initially and subsequently measures the tax liability or benefit as the largest amount that it judges to have a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority 
the liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances  such as the progress of tax audits  case law developments and new or emerging legislation 
such adjustments are recognized entirely in the period in which they are identified 
the effective tax rate includes the net impact of changes in the liability for unrecognized tax obligations or benefits and subsequent adjustments as considered appropriate by management 
the company s policy is to record interest and penalties as an increase in the liability for uncertain tax obligations or benefits and a corresponding increase to the income tax provision 
no such adjustments were recorded as of december   december   or december  share based compensation the company adopted a new stock option plan in december in conjunction with the corporate reorganization 
the company had originally adopted a stock option plan in the company applies the fair value method that requires all share based payments to employees and non employee directors  including grants of employee stock options  be expensed over their requisite service period based on their fair value at the grant date  using a prescribed option pricing model 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to value share based payments 
compensation expense related to share based awards is recognized on an accelerated basis 
the expense recognized is based on the straight line amortization of each individually vesting piece of a grant 
our typical grant vests at issuance and per year over the next three years 
the that vests immediately is also expensed immediately 
the part of the grant that vests equally over three years would expense all of the first year vesting in the first twelve months  the second vesting would be expensed over twenty four months and the third tranche would be expensed over thirty six months 
the calculated expense is required to be based upon awards that ultimately vest and we have accordingly  reduced the expense by estimated forfeitures 

table of contents the following assumptions were used for option grants during the periods ended december   december   and december  dividend yield the company has never declared or paid dividends on its common stock and has no plans to do so in the foreseeable future 
risk free interest rate risk free interest rate is based on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term approximating the expected life of the option term assumed at the date of grant 
expected volatility volatility is a measure of the amount by which a financial variable such as a share price has fluctuated historical volatility or is expected to fluctuate expected volatility during a period 
the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of existing comparable public companies for a period that approximates the estimated life of the options 
the company continues to use comparable public companies due to insufficient trading history of our own stock 
expected term of the options this is the period of time that the options granted are expected to remain unexercised 
the company estimates the expected life of the option term based on the expected tenure of employees and historical experience 
forfeiture rate the company estimates the percentage of options granted that are expected to be forfeited or canceled on an annual basis before stock options become fully vested 
the company uses the forfeiture rate that is a blend of past turnover data and a projection of expected results over the following twelve month period based on projected levels of operations and headcount levels at various classification levels with the company 
results of operations our results of operations for the years ended december   and were significantly affected by the acquisitions that were completed during those years 
in  we acquired three business operations with annual revenue of over million 
in  we continued our acquisitions by acquiring four companies with revenue in excess of million 
in  we continued our acquisitions by acquiring three companies and one contract with revenue in excess of million 
the acquisitions are included in our financial results from the date of acquisition forward 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  we started operating in two segments services and integrated solutions 
accordingly  we are reporting our financial results in aggregate and by segment 
note that our historical financial statements segregated services and products and those splits are identical with our new segments

overall results in thousands year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  revenue    gross margin    cost of operations   intangible amortization   non operating income expense   revenue revenue increased by approximately million between and as a result of the additions of jka  fasi and fld in which contributed million  the full year impact of everest  sycamore  iit and tagg  all acquired in  which contributed a net million more revenue in than in  our large production contract which contributed million and the overall growth of the services business  which contributed million in offset in part by a decrease in our integrated solutions of million 
our services revenue grew due to increased headcount as we continued to expand our positions within certain contracts and new contract wins 
revenue did not grow as significantly as we expected  as we focused on integrating the acquisitions during the first half of the year and did not hire as many staff as we intended 
we have refocused on hiring during the fourth quarter of and the hiring levels have started to return to our expected levels 
we continue to have a large backlog of unstaffed positions as we enter 
table of contents integrated solutions revenue declined due to a combination of several large orders in that were not replaced in and the government budget environment in  that created uncertainty with many of our customers regarding available funding 
accordingly  they purchased materially less product during the current budget environment has not changed significantly in from and we are not anticipating material change in our products revenue within the integrated solutions segment 
revenue increased by approximately million between and as a result of the acquisitions of tagg  iit  sycamore and everest which contributed approximately million of revenue in  the full year operations of esd  leds and recon which contributed approximately million  and the overall growth of our existing business of approximately million 
the expansion of our core business was split between a million increase in our integrated solutions and a million increase in our services business 
integrated solutions grew primarily from better name recognition as we became a more established company as well as expanded our product offerings 
services revenue grew due to increased hiring that allowed us to increase our billable staffed positions 
we anticipate that revenue will continue to grow in both organically and through acquisitions 
as we expect to complete an unknown number of acquisitions  we are unable to predict our revenue 
we do expect our revenue to grow at least from levels without acquisitions 
gross margin gross margin increased both as a percentage of revenue and in total dollars from to the revenue percentage increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of fld  offset in part by lower margins within the integrated solutions segment from the large production contract 
services margins increased slightly in gross margin dollars increased as a result of the margin increases previously described  plus increased revenue both from acquisitions and internal growth 
we expect gross margins to continue to expand at the consolidated level in as fld will be included for the full year 
gross margin increased slightly from to primarily due to the increased contribution of the integrated solutions gross margin in which improved from in to in partially offset by a reduction in services gross margin from to with the addition of tagg in the integrated solutions margin improved due to the product mix and the maturing of certain products in where we were able to achieve economies of scale not available in the services margin decreased slightly as tagg gross margins historically have run at whereas the rest of the company has historically run at approximately 
tagg utilizes a significant amount of subcontract labor which results in lower gross margins 
cost of operations cost of operations has decreased as a percentage of sales every year since there are several drivers for this decrease including revenue growth  company structure  and economies of scale 
the growth in revenue both organically and through acquisition has significantly exceeded the growth in overhead and general and administrative costs 
we anticipate that trend to continue 
the second main factor is the design of our corporate structure 
the company  since its inception  has been built for scalability and to operate at a much larger revenue base than it is currently operating 
the organizational infrastructure  executives  and managerial staff were put in place very early in the formation of the company to create an environment that would facilitate growth 
accordingly  the costs of that infrastructure weighed more heavily as a percentage of sales in and as we continue to grow  we expect that these costs as a percentage of revenue will continue to decrease 
additionally  as we continue to grow  we expect that our corporate staff will become more fully utilized and incremental increases in revenue will not necessarily equate to increases in support staff 
as we continue to make acquisitions  we anticipate capitalizing on certain inefficiencies  both internally and within our acquisitions  that existed due to the size of the companies 
another significant component of our operating expense is stock compensation 
every employee in the company has stock options and some have restricted stock grants 
we have seen a significant increase in the costs associated with these equity grants with costs of   and  for the twelve months ended december   and  respectively 
the company utilizes an accelerated method of recognizing expense  acceptable under gaap  which expenses equity grants more quickly than the 
table of contents traditional straight line expensing 
the majority of the equity compensation expense in and has been due to acquisitions 
we believe that it is important that all employees have an equity stake in our company and expect to continue issuing equity to new employees 
while the increase in equity compensation in as compared with the preceding two periods was significant  we expect that overall equity compensation expense should decrease as a percentage of revenue without any new acquisitions 
intangible amortization acquisitions have been a key part of the company growth story since inception 
as of december   we have completed acquisitions and have recorded intangible assets associated with each of these acquisitions 
our intangible amortization expense has increased from million in to million in to million in as a result of our acquisitions during this time 
the million of intangibles associated with the fld acquisition in august represents the largest single component of our intangible amortization expense in and barring any new large acquisitions  will be the largest component of intangible amortization expense in we expect intangible amortization to increase to million in  without any further acquisitions 
non operating income expense the non operating expense primarily consisted of interest expense related to the acquisitions of  the non operating income was comprised of three main components a gain recognized from the reduction of the tagg earn out  a gain from the clawback of purchase price from the leds acquisition  and offsetting interest expense related to the debt incurred from the tagg and iit acquisitions 
we originally recorded the estimated equity earn out expected to be paid to the tagg owners at the time of acquisition based on tagg s forecast and operating results at that time 
the earn out is based on actual revenue and gross margin for the two years ended december  during the year  we updated and revised our forecast of tagg s expected performance and adjusted our anticipated earn out accordingly 
by december   we determined that it was unlikely that tagg would meet the minimum performance threshold for achieving any earn out 
as a result  we recognized million in income from the write down of the earn out in the leds purchase agreement contained a clawback provision that allowed us to recover certain monies paid for the acquisition of leds if certain identified employees did not stay with the company for a specified amount of time 
under that agreement  the company recognized  of income from leds employee departures in during  the company incurred interest expense related to the purchases of tagg and iit 
this interest was composed of the interest on the term debt and credit line with bank of america and the subordinated debt with tagg and certain shareholders of the company 
the aggregate amount of interest expense recognized from these instruments was million

services segment results in thousands year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  revenue    gross margin    intangible amortization   revenue services revenue increased by approximately million in from from a combination of acquisitions that added million of revenue  acquisitions that added a net million of revenue  and organic growth that added approximately million of revenue 
revenue from acquisitions reflects in part the decrease in our air force related work in our organic growth has primarily been with our maryland customer with whom we have increased our prime contract work and expanded our positions on certain subcontracts 
we continue to see significant demand for our services  and a key to our continued organic growth is finding and hiring necessary cleared personnel 

table of contents the services growth from to of million was driven by acquisitions of million  acquisitions of million and organic growth of million 
the overall corporate growth in made hiring easier as compared with  and enabled us to fill open positions more easily 
gross margin services gross margins increased in dollars but remained consistent as a percentage of sales from to the increase in dollars is due to the increased revenue as previously discussed 
we expect a similar trend to continue in intangible amortization all of our acquisitions  with the exception of fld  have been in the services segment 
the growth in intangible expense reflects those acquisitions and we expect to continue to make acquisitions in the future 
our intangible amortization will be approximately million  assuming no new acquisitions 
using that same assumption  intangible amortization would drop to the million range in

integrated solutions segment results in thousands year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  revenue    gross margin    intangible amortization  revenue integrated solutions revenue increased by approximately million between and primarily as a result of the addition of fld  accounting for million in additional revenue  a large production contract  which contributed million in additional revenue  offset in part by a decline in our products revenue of million 
the large production contract was the first large order for our surface mount technology lab 
we have not received any similar orders as we look towards  but we do have a sustaining amount of smaller orders within the segment 
product revenue declined due to a combination of several large orders in that were not replaced in and the government budget environment in that created uncertainty with many of our customers regarding their available funding 
accordingly  they bought considerably less product during the current budget environment has not changed significantly in from and we are not anticipating material change in our products revenue 
we expect revenue to continue to grow in as we will have the full year impact of fld 
the extent of the growth will be determined by any large product orders and new plane contracts in during  we reserved  for certain inventory items where the market did not develop as expected 
the revenue growth for to of million was primarily driven by several large customer orders in  greater acceptance of our products as the company gained recognition from its start up in late  and a larger offering of products in in  we were still in ramp up mode with regard to full product offerings 
gross margin gross margin increased in dollars but decreased slightly as a percentage of revenue in from the decrease in gross margin percentage is primarily due to the initial delivery of the large production contract and a reserve taken against certain inventory items as the market did not develop as expected 
our first deliveries of any type of product result generally in lower margin than subsequent runs due to economies of scale and experienced gained in the production process 
the addition of fld has offset some of the lower margins described above 
total gross margin dollars increased due to the increased revenue partially offset by the lower margin percentage 
we expect gross margin percentage to increase in but any increase is dependent on normal operations of our air component and the absence of new large product runs 
intangible amortization the acquisition of fld represents the only intangibles associated with integrated solutions as the remainder of the business has been internally developed 
the fld intangibles are being amortized over months and will be completely amortized  barring any additional acquisitions  at the end of 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources at december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents 
we experienced several significant cash events during  including four acquisitions  restructuring our debt agreements  and stock repurchases 
cash from operations operations provided approximately million in cash during this amount primarily consisted of net income plus non cash adjustments for depreciation  amortization and stock compensation partially offset by increased working capital needs 
working capital consumed about million for increased receivables and the pay down of the outstanding accounts payable related to a large production contract from december  as we continue to grow  our working capital needs will increase accordingly  particularly with respect to accounts receivable 
the timing of payments will also have an impact on the liability balances similar to when we moved the employee bonus payments to december from january 
our need for additional working capital will be determined by our method and volume of growth 
growing through self performed labor will require more working capital than growing using subcontractors  but we expect self performed labor should be a more profitable alternative than using subcontractors 
the main difference for cash flow is that employees are generally paid within two weeks of incurring costs  whereas subcontractors are generally paid within days of receiving an invoice 
we had a number of non cash adjustments to our net income in including intangible amortization  stock compensation expense and an increase in depreciation from the fld acquisition 
intangible amortization was approximately million in and is expected to increase in due to the full year impact of our acquisitions  less any reduction in earlier year acquisition amortization 
we expect the intangible amortization  without any additional acquisitions  to be approximately million in we believe that all employees should have an ownership stake in the company 
accordingly  we grant all new employees  whether new hires or employees acquired via acquisition  options in the company 
our significant growth  both organically and through acquisition  has increased our stock compensation expense to million in we use an accelerated method of expensing stock options such that most of the expense is recorded during the first year of the options 
the combination of these transactions and other significantly less material non cash adjustments to net income brought our net income after non cash adjustments to million for we carry an inventory balance that is normally approximately million 
the inventory balance may increase or decrease significantly in any period based on sales  orders and breadth of product lines 
we do not carry significant quantities of specific products  rather we build products based on specific orders and at production runs that enable us to gain economies of scale 
our inventory carrying balance is reflective or our incurred cost and not expected sales prices or revenue to be derived from sales 
it is our intention to continue this inventory management practice in investing and financing during  we spent approximately million in cash plus equity consideration to complete four acquisitions 
this cash was ultimately supplied by our revolving credit facility that was renewed in february we expect our property and equipment purchases to increase in as we expand our aircraft operations and need additional aircraft 
we have an open stock repurchase plan for up to million shares at december  cash will be needed to fund any purchases under this plan 
credit facility at the end of  we had a million credit facility with a trio of banks led by bank of america that allowed us to choose interest rates anywhere from daily up to a six month lock 
the balance at december  was million 
on february   we replaced our then existing credit facility with a new million credit facility that includes an accordion feature allowing for an additional million in borrowing 
in conjunction with the fld acquisition in august  we increased the credit facility million and reloaded the accordion for million 
the credit facility is a year agreement and is structured as a multi bank facility with bank of america as lead bank 
the borrowing availability under this facility is based on keyw s total leverage ratio which is a relationship between funded indebtedness to 
table of contents ebitda 
when drawing funds on this facility we have the option of choosing between a euro rate loan which is based on the british bankers association libor or a base rate loan which is based on the higher of a the federal funds rate plus of  b the prime rate  or c the eurodollar rate plus 
if we selected the euro rate loan the actual applicable rate would be to basis points above the stated rate depending on where we fall on our most recent quarterly calculation of our total leverage ratio 
if we selected the base rate loan the actual applicable rate would be to basis points above the stated rate depending on where we fall on our most recent quarterly calculation of our total leverage ratio 
we are able to lock in our selected interest rates for periods of up to six months 
the available balance at december  under this credit facility was million plus the accordion 
outlook at december   our current ratio is negative due to the debt we have incurred from the acquisitions 
all of our debt is on our revolving credit facility that matures in february we believe our cash from operations will be sufficient to service the debt and to meet our financial obligations 
we expect that our cash flow from operations will be positive 
as discussed above  the manner in which we staff our contracts will impact the degree of working capital investment required to fuel our growth 
included in our net income are several significant non cash transactions that would be an add back to net income when calculating our cash flow from operations including stock compensation expense  amortization of intangibles and depreciation of fixed assets 
we expect that the dollar value of those expenses to continue to be in the million dollar range without any additional acquisitions during our overall expectation is that adjusted ebitda will be approximately of our revenue 
see discussion of adjusted ebitda in item of this form k 
we have increased the size of our available financing under the new debt facility in anticipation of acquiring new companies that are a strategic fit and enhance our corporate platform 
it is our goal to include an equity component in our acquisitions is our normal target equity component of total purchase price and the amount of equity we include in any acquisitions will impact our available cash and credit 
the pace and size of any acquisitions will determine how much  if any  of our available credit facility we utilize during the year 
we intend to invest in several potential growth areas in that may require us to expend more research and development dollars than we have historically 
while we have factored those expenses into our adjusted ebitda expectations above  these expenses may not be incurred evenly throughout the year 
after we went public in  employees and investors began to exercise their options and warrants 
some of these exercises were done cashlessly but other exercises were done by paying cash for their shares 
we are unable to forecast what the employee and investor activity will be in with regard to these instruments 
the total potential value of these instruments  if all exercised for cash  would be approximately million

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our financial position is exposed to several risks including interest rate risk and credit risk 
we do not use any derivative financial instruments to manage currency exchange rate risk  interest rate risk  equity market or commodity price risk 
currency exchange rates we conduct our business exclusively in us dollars 
in the rare instance where we purchase goods internationally  our invoices or accounts payable vouchers are denominated in us dollars 
all of our revenue is transacted in us dollars as well as substantially all of our operating expenditures and capital purchases 
because of the services we sell  we are not subjected to fluctuations when the us dollar either strengthens or weakens relative to other currencies because  for the most part  the us government cannot go overseas to purchase similar services 
interest rates we do not maintain an investment portfolio that would expose us to interest rate risk associated with fixed income securities 
nor do we participate in any fixed rate debt instruments that would require us to hedge interest rate risks with offsetting interest rate swaps 
the interest rates on our debt are affected by changes in market interest rates 
all outstanding balances under our term loan  and any amounts that may be borrowed under our revolving facility  are subject to interest rate fluctuations 
debt at the end of  we had a million credit facility with a trio of banks led by bank of america that allowed us to choose interest rates anywhere from daily up to a six month lock 
the balance at december  was million

we are able to lock in our selected interest rates for periods of up to six months 
equity price risk we do not currently own nor have we ever owned any marketable equity investments to include marketable equity securities and equity derivative instruments such as warrants and options 
therefore  since we do not currently own investments that are subject to market price volatility our equity price risk is very low
