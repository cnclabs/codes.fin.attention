critical accounting policies in preparing our financial statements  we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our revenues  income or loss from operations and net income or loss  as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet 
we believe that there are several accounting policies that are critical to an understanding of our historical and future performance  as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses and significant estimates and judgments applied by management 
while there are a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates affecting our financial statements  areas that are particularly significant include accounting for income taxes  and valuation and evaluating impairment of long lived assets and goodwill 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  under which deferred income taxes are recognized based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities given the provisions of enacted tax laws 
deferred income tax provisions and benefits are based on changes to the assets or liabilities from year to year 
in providing for deferred taxes  we consider tax regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate  estimates of future taxable income  and available tax planning strategies 
if tax regulations  operating results  or the ability to implement tax planning strategies vary  adjustments to the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities may be required 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the recorded valuation allowance is based on significant estimates and judgments and if the facts and circumstances change the valuation allowance could materially change 
in accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  we recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
the company recognizes interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 
as of september   the company had us federal and state net operating loss nol carry forwards of approximately  and  respectively 
the us federal nol carry forward amounts expire in fiscal years through if not utilized 
the state nol carry forward amounts expire in fiscal year through if not utilized 
in fiscal year  the company completed an internal revenue code section analysis of the loss carry forwards and determined that all of the company s loss carry forwards were utilizable and not restricted under section the company has not updated its section analysis subsequent to and does not believe there have been any events subsequent to that would impact the analysis 
as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that these deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not more likely than not or unknown  we must establish a valuation allowance 
prior to  a valuation allowance had been recorded which required the company to evaluate its future taxable income after consideration of positive and negative evidence 
if the valuation allowance is reduced  the company would record an income tax benefit in the period in which that determination is made 
if the valuation allowance is increased  the company would record additional income tax expense  consequently  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and  the company reversed a portion of its valuation allowance in consideration of all available positive and negative evidence  including our historical operating results  current financial condition  and potential future taxable income 
the reduction in the valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of fiscal year resulted in a non cash income tax benefit of  million 
we recorded an income tax benefit of  for the year ended september   compared to an income tax benefit  for the year ended september  our future potential taxable income was evaluated based on both historical profitability as well as anticipated operating results for future years 
based upon the assessment of all available evidence  the company reversed  million of additional valuation allowance for the year ended september   which was recorded as a one time income tax benefit 
as of september   the company s only remaining valuation allowance of approximately  relates to state net operating loss carry forwards we do not expect to utilize 
the company will continue to assess the assumptions used to determine the amount of our valuation allowance and may adjust the valuation allowance in future periods based on changes in assumptions of estimated future income and other factors 
if the remaining valuation allowance is reduced  we would record an income tax benefit in the period the valuation allowance is reduced 
if the remaining valuation allowance is increased  we would record additional income tax expense 
the company files income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction  and various state jurisdictions 
based on its evaluation  the company has concluded that it has no significant unrecognized tax benefits 
with limited exceptions  the company is no longer subject to us federal and state income tax examinations for fiscal years ending prior to we are generally subject to us federal and state tax examinations for all tax years since due to our net operating loss carryforwards and the utilization of the carryforwards in years still open under statute 
in the company changed its fiscal year to september impairment of long lived assets and goodwill the company s long lived assets at september  consisted of property  plant and equipment  patents and goodwill 
the company reviews the carrying amount of its property  plant and equipment and patents if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
when this review indicates the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets  the company recognizes an asset impairment charge against operations for the amount by which the carrying amount of the impaired asset exceeds its fair value 
determining fair values of property  plant and equipment and patents using a discounted cash flow method involves significant judgment and requires the company to make significant estimates and assumptions  including long term projections of cash flows  market conditions and appropriate discount rates 
judgments are based on historical experience  current market trends  consultations with external valuation specialists and other information 
if facts and circumstances change  the use of different estimates and assumptions could result in a materially different outcome 
the company generally develops these forecasts based on recent sales data for existing products  planned timing of new product launches  and estimated expansion of the fttp market 
the company reviews the carrying amount of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the company measures the possible goodwill impairment loss based on an allocation of the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit to all of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  including any previously unrecognized intangible assets 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that a reporting unit s recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 
the company utilizes a market capitalization approach for testing its goodwill  whereby a significant reduction in our market capitalization or in the carrying amount of net assets of a reporting unit could result in an impairment charge 
this test for the period ended september  resulted in no change to goodwill from the prior period 
during the prior quarter ends  there were no triggering events that indicated impairment existed and there were no adjustments to goodwill 
an impairment loss would be based on significant estimates and judgments and if the facts and circumstances change a potential impairment could have a material impact 
no impairment of long lived assets or goodwill has occurred during the years ended september  or  respectively 
results of operations year ended september  compared to year ended september  revenues for the fiscal year increased to  from revenue of  in revenue growth was experienced from existing clients as well as from the development of new accounts within the telecommunications industry 
the growth in revenue includes gains from within tier carriers  as well as from an emerging presence associated with tier carriers who have a national footprint

general and administrative expenses were  in fiscal versus  in fiscal year  a decrease of  mainly due to a decrease of  in incentive compensation related to the achievement of objectives in fiscal income from operations for fiscal year was  compared to  for fiscal year this increase is due to the increase in revenue and a decrease in incentive compensation expense for fiscal year interest income in fiscal year was  compared to  for the fiscal year the decrease is a result of declining interest rates resulting in lower returns on our investments

however  future growth  organically or through acquisition  may require the company to raise capital through additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that any such financing would be available on commercially acceptable terms
