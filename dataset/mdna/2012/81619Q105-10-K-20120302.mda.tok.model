item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read this discussion together with the selected financial data and consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere herein 
overview we believe that we are one of the largest operators of both specialty hospitals and outpatient rehabilitation clinics in the united states based on number of facilities 
as of december   we operated ltchs and nine acute medical rehabilitation hospitals in states  and outpatient rehabilitation clinics in states and the district of columbia 
we also provide medical rehabilitation services on a contracted basis to nursing homes  hospitals  assisted living and senior care centers  schools and work sites 
we began operations in under the leadership of our current management team 
as of december  we had operations in states and the district of columbia 
we manage our company through two business segments  our specialty hospital segment and our outpatient rehabilitation segment 
we had net operating revenues of  million for the year ended december  of this total  we earned approximately of our net operating revenues from our specialty hospitals and approximately from our outpatient rehabilitation business 
our specialty hospital segment consists of hospitals designed to serve the needs of long term stay acute care patients and hospitals designed to serve patients that require intensive medical rehabilitation care 
patients are typically admitted to our specialty hospitals from general acute care hospitals 
these patients have specialized needs  and serious and often complex medical conditions such as respiratory failure  neuromuscular disorders  traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries  strokes  non healing wounds  cardiac disorders  renal disorders and cancer 
our outpatient rehabilitation segment consists of clinics and contract therapy locations that provide physical  occupational and speech rehabilitation services 
our outpatient rehabilitation patients are typically diagnosed with musculoskeletal impairments that restrict their ability to perform normal activities of daily living 
significant events refinancing on june   select entered into a new senior secured credit agreement that provides for billion in senior secured credit facilities  comprised of an million  seven year term loan facility and a million five year revolving credit facility of which million was drawn at closing

the baylor jv consists of a partnership between baylor institute for rehabilitation and select physical therapy 
table of contents texas  a wholly owned subsidiary of select 
we contributed several businesses to the baylor jv  including our frisco irf and certain of our texas based outpatient rehabilitation clinics 
a gain of million was recognized on this contribution during the second quarter of and is included in the general and administrative line item on the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  additionally  during the second quarter of  we invested million in cash which consisted of the purchase of partnership units for million and working capital investments of million 
we own a interest in the partnership and account for the investment using the equity method because we do not have a controlling interest

since the inception of the program through december   the company has repurchased  shares at a cost of million  which includes transaction costs 
summary financial results year ended december  for the year ended december   our net operating revenues increased to  million compared to  million for the year ended december  this increase in net operating revenues resulted principally from a increase in our specialty hospital net operating revenue 
the increase in our specialty hospital revenue is primarily due to the regency hospitals we acquired on september  we had income from operations for the year ended december  of million compared to million for the year ended december  we had net income for the year ended december  of million compared to million for the year ended december  our adjusted ebitda for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  see the section entitled results of operations for a reconciliation of net income to adjusted ebitda 

table of contents the increase in income from operations  net income and adjusted ebitda resulted from the addition of the regency hospitals acquired on september  and improved operating performance at our other specialty hospitals 
holdings interest expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  select s interest expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense for both holdings and select is attributable to a reduction in our average interest rate that resulted from the expiration of interest rate swaps during that carried higher fixed interest rates  and lower interest rates on portions of the debt we refinanced on june  cash flow from operations provided million of cash for the year ended december  for holdings and million of cash for the year ended december  for select 
the difference between holdings and select primarily relates to interest payments on holdings senior subordinated notes and senior floating rate notes 
year ended december  for the year ended december   our net operating revenues increased to  million compared to  million for the year ended december  this increase in net operating revenues resulted from a increase in our specialty hospital net operating revenue and a increase in our outpatient rehabilitation net operating revenue 
the increase in our specialty hospital revenue is principally due to the hospitals we opened and acquired in and we had income from operations for the year ended december  of million compared to million for the year ended december  we had net income for the year ended december  of million compared to million for the year ended december  the small increases in our net income and income from operations are principally related to a reduction in our general and administrative expenses offset in part by a decline in profitability of our specialty hospitals opened as of january  and operated throughout both periods 
our adjusted ebitda for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the decline in our adjusted ebitda resulted from the decline in profitability of our specialty hospitals opened as of january  and operated throughout both periods  a decline in the performance of the contract services portion of our outpatient rehabilitation business and higher general and administrative expenses principally related to additional costs we incurred associated with the transition and closing of the regency corporate office

regulatory changes the medicare program reimburses us for services furnished to medicare beneficiaries  which are generally persons age and older  those who are chronically disabled and those suffering from end stage renal disease 
net operating revenues generated directly from the medicare program represented approximately of our consolidated net operating revenues for both the years ended december  and and for the year ended december  
table of contents the medicare program reimburses our ltchs  irfs and outpatient rehabilitation providers  using different payment methodologies 
those payment methodologies are complex and are described elsewhere in this report under business government regulation 
the following is a summary of some of the more significant healthcare regulatory changes that have affected our financial performance in the periods covered by this report or are likely to affect our financial performance and financial condition in the future 
medicare reimbursement of ltch services in the last few years  there have been significant regulatory changes affecting ltchs that have affected our net operating revenues and  in some cases  caused us to change our operating models and strategies 
we have been subject to regulatory changes that occur through the rulemaking procedures of cms 
historically  rule updates occurred twice each year 
all medicare payments to our ltchs are made in accordance with ltch pps 
proposed rules specifically related to ltchs were generally published in january  finalized in may and effective on july st of each year 
additionally  ltchs are subject to annual updates to the rules related to ipps that are typically proposed in may  finalized in august and effective on october st of each year 
in the annual payment rate update for the fiscal year  cms consolidated the two historical annual updates into one annual update 
the final rule adopted a month rate update for fiscal year and moved the ltch pps from a july june update cycle to an october september cycle 
commencing with fiscal year  the ltch updates begin october  coinciding with the start of the federal fiscal year 
the following is a summary of significant changes to the medicare prospective payment system for ltchs during  and  as well as the policies and payment rates for fiscal year fiscal year on august   cms published the ipps final rule for fiscal year affecting discharges and cost reports beginning on or after october  through september   which made limited revisions to the classifications of cases in ms ltc drgs 
on june   cms published an interim final rule in which cms adopted a new table of ms ltc drg relative weights that apply from june  to the remainder of fiscal year through september  
this interim final rule revised the ms ltc drg relative weights for payment under the ltch pps for fiscal year due to cms s misapplication of its established methodology in the calculation of the budget neutrality factor 
this error resulted in relative weights that were higher  by approximately for all of fiscal year october  through september  
however  cms only applied the corrected weights to the remainder of fiscal year that is  from june  through september  
fiscal year on august   cms published its annual payment rate update for the ltch pps fiscal year affecting discharges and cost reporting periods beginning on or after october  through september  
the increase in the standard federal rate applied a update factor based on the market basket update of less an adjustment of to account for what cms attributes as an increase in case mix resulting from changes in documentation and coding practices 
as a result  the standard federal rate for fiscal year was set at  an increase from the previous standard federal rate of  the fixed loss amount for high cost outlier cases was set at  a decrease from the previous fixed loss amount of  on june   cms published a notice of changes to the payment rates for ltch pps during the portion of fiscal year occurring on or after april  the standard federal rate for discharges occurring on or after april  was revised downward to  from  established in the original final rule for fiscal year this change to the ltch pps standard federal rate for the remainder of fiscal year was based on an additional market basket reduction of as mandated by the ppaca described below 
the notice revised the fixed loss amount for high cost outlier cases for fiscal year discharges occurring on or after april  to  which was higher than the fixed loss amount of  in effect from october  to march  fiscal year on august   cms published the policies and payment rates for ltch pps for fiscal year affecting discharges and cost reporting periods beginning on or after october  through september  
the standard federal rate for fiscal year is  which is a decrease from the fiscal year standard federal rate of  in effect from october  to march  and the fiscal 
table of contents year standard federal rate of  that went into effect on april  this update to the ltch pps standard federal rate for fiscal year is based on a market basket increase of less a reduction of to account for what cms attributes as an increase in case mix in prior periods that resulted from changes in documentation and coding practices less an additional reduction of as mandated by the ppaca 
the final rule establishes a fixed loss amount for high cost outlier cases for fiscal year of  which is higher than the fiscal year fixed loss amount of  in effect from october  to march  and the  that went into effect on april  the final rule also included revisions to the relative weights for each of the ms ltc drgs for fiscal year fiscal year on august   cms published the policies and payment rates for ltch pps for fiscal year affecting discharges and cost reporting periods beginning on or after october  through september  
the standard federal rate for fiscal year is  an increase from the fiscal year standard federal rate of  the final rule establishes a fixed loss amount for high cost outlier cases for fiscal year of  which is a decrease from the fixed loss amount in the fiscal year of  the labor related share of the ltch pps standard federal rate is adjusted annually to account for geographic differences in area wage levels by applying the applicable ltch pps wage index 
cms adopted a decrease in the labor related share from to under the ltch pps for fiscal year in addition  cms applied an area wage level budget neutrality factor to the standard federal rate to make annual changes to the area wage level adjustment budget neutral 
previously  there was no statutory or regulatory requirement that these adjustments to the area wage level be made in a budget neutral manner 
the final rule creates a regulatory requirement that any adjustments or updates to the area wage level adjustment be made in a budget neutral manner such that estimated aggregate ltch pps payments are not affected 
an ltch must have an average inpatient length of stay for medicare patients including both medicare covered and non covered days of greater than days 
in the preamble to the final rule for fiscal year  cms clarified its policy on the calculation of the average length of stay by specifying that all data on all medicare inpatient days  including medicare advantage days  must be included in the average length of stay calculation effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after january  extension of changes made by the medicare  medicaid  and schip extension act of on march   president obama signed into law the ppaca 
the ppaca adopts significant changes to the medicare program that are particularly relevant to our ltchs and irfs 
among other changes  the ppaca applies a market basket payment adjustment to ltchs and irfs 
in addition  the ppaca includes a two year extension to sections of the schip extension act  as amended by the arra 
the two year extension applies the relief granted to the percent rule payment adjustment  the one time budget neutrality adjustment and the very short stay outlier payment adjustment 
the two year extension also applies to the moratorium on new ltchs and new ltch beds adopted in the schip extension act 
these changes are described further below 
medicare market basket adjustments the ppaca instituted a market basket payment adjustment to ltchs 
in fiscal year  ltchs were subject to a market basket reduction of for discharges occurring after april  through september  in fiscal year  ltchs are subject to a market basket reduction of 
there will be a slightly smaller market basket reduction for ltchs in fiscal years and in fiscal year  the market basket update will be reduced by 
fiscal years and the market basket update will be reduced by 
finally  in fiscal years through  the market basket update will be reduced by 
the ppaca specifically allows these market basket reductions to result in less than a payment update and payment rates that are less than the prior year 

table of contents hospital wage index the ppaca calls for cms to abandon the current system of calculating the hospital wage index based on data submitted in hospital cost reports  which currently has a four year lag in data 
in its place  cms is required to develop and present to congress a comprehensive reform plan using bureau of labor statistics data  or other data or methodologies  to calculate relative wages for each geographic area involved 
although the ppaca addresses the hospital wage index generally  this change presumably applies to ltchs given that the ltch pps wage index is computed using wage data from general acute care hospitals 
percent rule the percent rule is a downward payment adjustment that applies to medicare patients discharged from ltchs who were admitted from a co located host hospital or a non co located hospital and caused the ltch to exceed the applicable percentage thresholds for discharged medicare patients 
the schip extension act  as amended by the arra and the ppaca  has limited the application of the percent rule  as described elsewhere in this report under business government regulation 
after the expiration of the regulatory relief provided by the schip extension act  the arra and the ppaca  our ltchs will be subject to a downward payment adjustment for any medicare patients who were admitted from a co located or a non co located hospital and that exceed the applicable percentage threshold of all medicare patients discharged from the ltch during the cost reporting period 
one time budget neutrality adjustment the regulations governing ltch pps authorizes cms to make a one time adjustment to the standard federal rate to correct any significant difference between actual payments and estimated payments for the first year of ltch pps 
the schip extension act precluded cms from implementing the one time prospective adjustment to the ltch standard federal rate for a period of three years 
the ppaca extends by two years the stay on cms s ability to adopt a one time budget neutrality adjustment to ltch pps 
in the rate year final rule  cms estimated this one time adjustment would result in a negative adjustment of to the ltch base rate 
the ppaca prohibits such a one time adjustment before december  short stay outlier policy the schip extension act prevented cms from applying the so called very short stay outlier policy for discharges occurring after july  this policy would result in a payment equivalent to the general acute care hospital rate for cases with a length of stay that is less than the average length of stay plus one standard deviation of a case with the same diagnosis related group under ipps  regardless of the clinical considerations for admission to the ltch or the average length of stay an ltch must satisfy for medicare certification 
the schip extension act precluded cms from implementing the very short stay outlier policy for a period of three years 
the ppaca extends this prohibition by two years 
cms may not apply the very short stay outlier policy before december  moratorium on new ltchs and new ltch beds the schip extension act imposed a moratorium on the establishment and classification of new ltchs  ltch satellite facilities and ltch beds in existing ltchs or satellite facilities subject to certain exceptions 
the ppaca extends this moratorium by two years 
the moratorium will now expire on december  medicare reimbursement of inpatient rehabilitation facility services the following is a summary of significant changes to the medicare prospective payment system for irfs during  and  as well as the policies and payment rates for fiscal year fiscal year on august   cms published its final rule establishing the annual payment rate update for the irf pps for fiscal year affecting discharges and cost reporting periods beginning on or after october  through september  
the standard federal rate is established at  for fiscal year 
table of contents  an increase from  in fiscal year affecting discharges and cost reporting periods beginning on or after october  through september  
the outlier threshold amount was set at  an increase from  in fiscal year in the same final rule  cms adopted new coverage criteria  including requirements for preadmission screening  post admission evaluations  and individualized treatment planning that emphasize the role of physicians in ordering and overseeing beneficiaries irf care 
among other things  the rule requires irf services to be ordered by a rehabilitation physician with specialized training and experience in rehabilitation services and be coordinated by an interdisciplinary team meeting the rule s specifications 
the interdisciplinary team must meet weekly to review the patient s progress and make any needed adjustments to the individualized plan of care 
irfs must use qualified personnel to provide required rehabilitation nursing  physical therapy  occupational therapy  speech language pathology  social services  psychological services  and prosthetic and orthotic services cms notes that it also is considering adopting specific standards on the use of group therapies at a future date 
the rule also includes new documentation requirements  including a requirement that irfs submit patient assessment data on medicare advantage patients 
on july   cms published a notice of changes to the payment rates for irf pps during the portion of fiscal year occurring on or after april  as described below  the ppaca mandated a market basket reduction of for the remainder of fiscal year to the standard conversion factor 
for discharges occurring on or after april   the standard payment conversion factor was revised downward to  from  established in the original final rule for fiscal year in the same notice  cms increased the outlier threshold amount to  for discharges occurring on or after april  for the remainder of the fiscal year 
the outlier threshold was  for discharges occurring on or after october  through march  fiscal year on july   cms published an update to the payment rates for irf pps for fiscal year affecting discharges and cost reporting periods beginning on or after october  through september  
the standard federal rate for discharges during fiscal year is revised to  this change reflects an increase from  established in the revised final rule for fiscal year  and includes the market basket reduction of required by the ppaca 
cms also increased the outlier threshold amount for fiscal year to  from  fiscal year on august   cms published the policies and payment rates for irf pps for fiscal year affecting discharges and cost reporting periods beginning on or after october  and through september  
the standard federal rate for discharges for fiscal year is  which is an increase from  applicable during fiscal year cms initially decreased the outlier threshold amount for fiscal year to  from  for fiscal year in a notice published september   cms corrected its calculation of the outlier threshold amount for fiscal year to  from  medicare market basket adjustments the ppaca instituted a market basket payment adjustment for irfs

medicare reimbursement of outpatient rehabilitation services the medicare program reimburses outpatient rehabilitation providers based on the medicare physician fee schedule 
the medicare physician fee schedule rates are automatically updated annually based on the sgr formula  contained in legislation 
the sgr formula has resulted in automatic reductions in rates in every year since  however  for each year through cms or congress has taken action to prevent the sgr formula reductions 
the middle class tax relief and job creation act of froze medicare physician fee schedule rates at levels through december   temporarily averting a scheduled cut as a result of the sgr formula that would have taken effect on march  a reduction in the medicare physician fee schedule 
table of contents payment rates will occur on january   unless congress again takes legislative action to prevent the sgr formula reductions from going into effect 
for the year ended december   we received approximately of our outpatient rehabilitation net operating revenues from medicare 
on october   medpac voted to recommend that congress repeal and replace the statutory sgr formula 
the medpac proposal  which would require congressional approval  would freeze current medicare mpfs rates for primary care services for years  while other services would be subject to annual payment reductions of for years  followed by a freeze on payments for the next seven years 
medpac offered a list of options for congress to consider if it decides to offset sgr repeal costs estimated at about billion over years within the medicare program 
in addition to the sgr proposal  medpac recommended that congress direct cms to collect data on provider service volume and work time to establish more accurate relative value unit payment rates and to identify and reduce overpriced fee schedule services 
similarly  the ppaca requires cms to identify and review potentially misvalued codes and make appropriate adjustments to the relative values of those services identified as being misvalued 
in the final update to the medicare physician fee schedule for calendar year cms identified several cpt codes used by physical therapists as codes they will review 
therapy caps beginning on january   the balanced budget act of subjected certain outpatient therapy providers reimbursed under the medicare physician fee schedule to annual limits for therapy expenses 
effective january   the annual limit on outpatient therapy services is  for combined physical and speech language pathology services and  for occupational therapy services 
the per beneficiary caps were  for calendar year the annual limits for therapy expenses do not apply to services furnished and billed by outpatient hospital departments 
however  beginning no later than october  and expiring on december  the middle class tax relief and job creation act of will apply the annual limits on therapy expenses to hospital outpatient department settings 
the application of annual limits to hospital outpatient department settings will sunset at the end of unless congress extends it into we operated outpatient rehabilitation clinics at december   of which are provider based outpatient rehabilitation clinics operated as departments of the inpatient rehabilitation hospitals we operated 
in the deficit reduction act of  congress implemented an exceptions process to the annual limit for therapy expenses 
under this process  a medicare enrollee or person acting on behalf of the medicare enrollee is able to request an exception from the therapy caps if the provision of therapy services was deemed to be medically necessary 
therapy cap exceptions have been available automatically for certain conditions and on a case by case basis upon submission of documentation of medical necessity 
the middle class tax relief and job creation act of extends the exceptions process for outpatient therapy caps through december  unless congress extends the exceptions process  the therapy caps will apply to all outpatient therapy services beginning january   except those services furnished and billed by outpatient hospital departments 
the middle class tax relief and job creation act of makes several changes to the exceptions process to the annual limit for therapy expenses 
for any claim above the annual limit  the claim must contain a modifier  such as the kx modifier  indicating that the services are medically necessary and justified by appropriate documentation in the medical record 
effective october   all claims exceeding  will be subject to a manual medical review process 
the  threshold will be applied separately to the combined physical therapy speech therapy cap and the occupational therapy cap 
effective october   all therapy claims  whether above or below the annual limit  must include the national provider identifier npi of the physician responsible for certifying and periodically reviewing the plan of care 
several government agencies are expected to release reports on aspects of the medicare payment system for therapy services 
in the final medicare physician fee schedule rule  cms indicated the agency is evaluating alternative payment methodologies that would provide appropriate payment for medically necessary and effective therapy services furnished to medicare beneficiaries based on patient needs rather than the current therapy caps 
the middle class tax relief and job creation act of directs the medpac to submit a report 
table of contents to congress by june  making recommendations on how to reform the payment system to better reflect acuity  condition  and the therapy needs of the patient 
the medpac report is to include an examination of private sector initiatives related to therapy benefits 
in addition  the gao is directed to issue a report no later than may  regarding implementation of the manual medical review process instituted by the middle class tax relief and job creation act of the report must detail the number of beneficiaries subject to the process  the number of reviews conducted  and the outcome of the reviews 
finally  beginning on january   cms is required to collect additional data on therapy claims related to patient function during the course of therapy in order to better understand patient conditions and outcomes 
multiple procedure payment reduction cms adopted a multiple procedure payment reduction for therapy services in the final update to the medicare physician fee schedule 
under the policy  the medicare program pays of the practice expense component of the therapy procedure or unit of service with the highest relative value unit and then reduces the payment for the practice expense component by in office and other non institutional settings and in institutional settings for the second and subsequent therapy procedures or units of service furnished during the same day for the same patient  regardless of whether those therapy services are furnished in separate sessions 
this multiple procedure payment reduction policy became effective january  and applies to all outpatient therapy services paid under medicare part b 
furthermore  the multiple procedure payment reduction policy applies across all therapy disciplines occupational therapy  physical therapy and speech language pathology 
our outpatient rehabilitation therapy services are primarily offered in institutional settings and  as such  will be subject to the applicable payment reduction in the practice expense component for the second and subsequent therapy services furnished by us to the same patient on the same day 
in the proposed medicare physician fee schedule rule  cms indicated that over the next year it will continue to review whether specific cpt codes billed under the fee schedule are overvalued or undervalued  including certain specific cpt codes used by physical therapists 
development of new specialty hospitals and clinics in addition to the growth of our business through the acquisition and integration of other businesses  we have also grown our business through specialty hospital and outpatient rehabilitation facility development opportunities 
since our inception in through december   we have internally developed specialty hospitals and outpatient rehabilitation clinics 
the schip extension act instituted a three year moratorium on the development of new ltchs  and the ppaca extended this moratorium by two years 
as a result  we have stopped all new ltch development 
we will continue to evaluate opportunities to develop new joint venture relationships with significant health systems and from time to time we may also develop new inpatient rehabilitation hospitals 
we also intend to open new outpatient rehabilitation clinics in the local areas that we currently serve where we can benefit from existing referral relationships and brand awareness to produce incremental growth 
critical accounting matters merger transactions on february   egl acquisition corp 
was merged with and into select  with select continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of holdings 
the merger was completed pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger  dated as of october   among egl acquisition corp  holdings and select 
we refer to the merger and the related transactions collectively as the merger 
as a result of the merger transactions  the majority of select s assets and liabilities were adjusted to their fair value as of february  the excess of the total purchase price over the fair value of select s tangible and identifiable intangible assets was allocated to goodwill 
additionally  a portion of the equity related to our continuing stockholders was recorded at the stockholder s predecessor basis and a corresponding portion of the fair value of the acquired assets was reduced accordingly 

table of contents sources of revenue our net operating revenues are derived from a number of sources  including commercial  managed care  private and governmental payors 
our net operating revenues include amounts estimated by management to be reimbursable from each of the applicable payors and the federal medicare program 
amounts we receive for treatment of patients are generally less than the standard billing rates 
we account for the differences between the estimated reimbursement rates and the standard billing rates as contractual adjustments  which we deduct from gross revenues to arrive at net operating revenues 
net operating revenues generated directly from the medicare program from all segments represented approximately  and of net operating revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
approximately  and of our specialty hospital revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively  were received for services provided to medicare patients 
most of our specialty hospitals receive bi weekly periodic interim payments from medicare instead of being paid on an individual claim basis 
under a periodic interim payment methodology  medicare estimates a hospital s claim volume based on historical trends and makes bi weekly interim payments to us based on these estimates 
twice a year per hospital  medicare reconciles the differences between the actual claim data and the estimated payments 
to the extent our actual hospital s experience is different from the historical trends used by medicare to develop the estimate  the periodic interim payment will result in our being either temporarily over paid or under paid for our medicare claims 
at each balance sheet date  we record any aggregate under payment as an account receivable or any aggregate over payment as a payable to third party payors on our balance sheet 
the timing of when we receive our bi weekly periodic interim payments can have an impact on our accounts receivable balance and our days sales outstanding as of the end of any reporting period 
contractual adjustments net operating revenues include amounts estimated by us to be reimbursable by medicare and medicaid under prospective payment systems and provisions of cost reimbursement and other payment methods 
in addition  we are reimbursed by non governmental payors using a variety of payment methodologies 
amounts we receive for treatment of patients covered by these programs are generally less than the standard billing rates 
contractual allowances are calculated and recorded through our internally developed systems 
in our specialty hospital segment our billing system automatically calculates estimated medicare reimbursement and associated contractual allowances 
for non governmental payors in our specialty hospital segment  we manually calculate the contractual allowance for each patient based upon the contractual provisions associated with the specific payor 
in our outpatient segment  we perform provision testing  using internally developed systems  whereby we monitor a payors historical paid claims data and compare it against the associated gross charges 
this difference is determined as a percentage of gross charges and is applied against gross billing revenue to determine the contractual allowances for the period 
additionally  these contractual percentages are applied against the gross receivables on the balance sheet to determine that adequate contractual reserves are maintained for the gross accounts receivables reported on the balance sheet 
we account for any difference as additional contractual adjustments to gross revenues to arrive at net operating revenues in the period that the difference is determined 
we believe the processes described above and used in recording our contractual adjustments have resulted in reasonable estimates determined on a consistent basis 
allowance for doubtful accounts substantially all of our accounts receivable are related to providing healthcare services to patients 
collection of these accounts receivable is our primary source of cash and is critical to our financial performance 
our primary collection risks relate to non governmental payors who insure these patients  and deductibles  co payments and self insured amounts owed by the patient 
deductibles  co payments and self insured amounts are an immaterial portion of our net accounts receivable balance 
at december   deductibles  co payments and self insured amounts owed by the patient accounted for approximately of our net accounts receivable balance before doubtful accounts 
our general policy is to verify insurance coverage prior to the date of admission for a patient admitted to our hospitals or in the case of our outpatient rehabilitation clinics  we 
table of contents verify insurance coverage prior to their first therapy visit 
our estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated by providing a reserve allowance based upon the age of an account balance 
generally we reserve as uncollectible all governmental accounts over days and non governmental accounts over days from discharge 
this method is monitored based on our historical cash collections experience 
collections are impacted by the effectiveness of our collection efforts with non governmental payors and regulatory or administrative disruptions with the fiscal intermediaries that pay our governmental receivables 
we estimate bad debts for total accounts receivable within each of our operating units 
our policies have resulted in reasonable estimates determined on a consistent basis 
we have historically collected substantially all of our third party insured receivables net of contractual allowances which include receivables from governmental agencies 
historically  there has not been a material difference between our bad debt allowances and the ultimate historical collection rates on accounts receivable 
we review our overall reserve adequacy by monitoring historical cash collections as a percentage of net revenue less the provision for bad debts 
uncollected accounts are written off the balance sheet when they are turned over to an outside collection agency  or when management determines that the balance is uncollectible  whichever occurs first 
the following table is an aging of our net after allowances for contractual adjustments but before doubtful accounts accounts receivable in thousands balance as of december  days over days days over days medicare and medicaid commercial insurance  and other total net accounts receivable the approximate percentage of total net accounts receivable after allowance for contractual adjustments but before doubtful accounts summarized by aging categories is as follows as of december  to days to days to days over days total the approximate percentage of total net accounts receivable after allowance for contractual adjustments but before doubtful accounts summarized by insured status is as follows as of december  government payors and insured receivables self pay receivables including deductible and co payments total insurance under a number of our insurance programs  which include our employee health insurance program and certain components under our property and casualty insurance program  we are liable for a portion of our losses 

table of contents in these cases we accrue for our losses under an occurrence based principle whereby we estimate the losses that will be incurred by us in a given accounting period and accrue that estimated liability 
where we have substantial exposure  we utilize actuarial methods in estimating the losses 
in cases where we have minimal exposure  we will estimate our losses by analyzing historical trends 
we monitor these programs quarterly and revise our estimates as necessary to take into account additional information 
at december  and december   we have recorded a liability of million and million  respectively  for our estimated losses under these insurance programs 
related party transactions we are party to various rental and other agreements with companies affiliated with us through common ownership 
our payments to these related parties amounted to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our future commitments are related to commercial office space we lease for our corporate headquarters in mechanicsburg  pennsylvania 
these future commitments as of december  amount to million through these transactions and commitments are described more fully in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included herein 
the company s practice is that any such transaction must receive the prior approval of both the audit and compliance committee of the board of directors and a majority of non interested members of the board of directors 
in addition  it is the company s practice that  prior to any related party transaction for the lease of office space  that an independent third party appraisal is obtained that supports the amount of rent that the company is obligated to pay for such leased space 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and certain other indefinite lived intangible assets are subject to periodic impairment evaluations 
our most recent impairment assessment was completed during the fourth quarter of  which indicated that there was no impairment with respect to goodwill or other recorded intangible assets 
the majority of our goodwill resides in our specialty hospital reporting unit 
in performing periodic impairment tests  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to the carrying value  including goodwill and other intangible assets 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  an impairment condition exists  which results in an impairment loss equal to the excess carrying value 
impairment tests are required to be conducted at least annually  or when events or conditions occur that might suggest a possible impairment 
these events or conditions include  but are not limited to  a significant adverse change in the business environment  regulatory environment or legal factors  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of such losses or a projection of continuing losses  or a sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 
the occurrence of one of these events or conditions could significantly impact an impairment assessment  necessitating an impairment charge and adversely affecting our results of operations 
for purposes of goodwill impairment assessment  we have defined our reporting units as specialty hospitals  outpatient rehabilitation clinics and contract therapy with goodwill having been allocated among reporting units based on the relative fair value of those divisions when the merger occurred in and based on subsequent acquisitions 
to determine the fair value of our reporting units  we use a discounted cash flow approach 
included in the discounted cash flow are assumptions regarding revenue growth rates  internal development of specialty hospitals and rehabilitation clinics  future ebitda margin estimates  future selling  general and administrative expense rates and the weighted average cost of capital for our industry 
we also must estimate residual values at the end of the forecast period and future capital expenditure requirements 
each of these assumptions requires us to use our knowledge of our industry  our recent transactions and reasonable performance expectations for our operations 
if any one of the above assumptions changes or fails to materialize  the resulting decline in our estimated fair value could result in a material impairment charge to the goodwill associated with any one of the reporting units 
realization of deferred tax assets deferred tax assets and liabilities are required to be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are 
table of contents also required to be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes based on our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
we also recognize as deferred tax assets the future tax benefits from net operating loss carry forwards 
we evaluate the realizability of these deferred tax assets by assessing their valuation allowances and by adjusting the amount of such allowances  if necessary 
among the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are our projections of future taxable income streams  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences  and the impact of tax planning strategies that could be implemented to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits 
however  changes in tax codes  statutory tax rates or future taxable income levels could materially impact our valuation of tax accruals and assets and could cause our provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period 
at december   we had deferred tax liabilities in excess of deferred tax assets of approximately million for both holdings and select principally due to depreciation deductions that have been accelerated for tax purposes 
this amount includes approximately million of valuation reserves related primarily to state net operating losses 
uncertain tax positions we record and review quarterly our uncertain tax positions 
reserves for uncertain tax positions are established for exposure items related to various federal and state tax matters 
income tax reserves are recorded when an exposure is identified and when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that a tax position will not be sustained and the amount of the liability can be estimated 
while we believe that our reserves for uncertain tax positions are adequate  the settlement of any such exposures at amounts that differ from current reserves may require us to materially increase or decrease our reserves for uncertain tax positions 
stock based compensation we measure the compensation costs of share based compensation arrangements based on the grant date fair value and recognize the costs in the financial statements over the period during which employees are required to provide services 
our share based compensation arrangements comprise both stock options and restricted share plans 
we value employee stock options using the black scholes option valuation method that uses assumptions that relate to the expected volatility of our common stock  the expected dividend yield of our stock  the expected life of the options and the risk free interest rate 
such compensation amounts  if any  are amortized over the respective vesting periods or period of service of the option grant 
we value restricted stock grants by using the public market price of our stock on the date of grant 

table of contents operating statistics the following tables set forth operating statistics for our specialty hospitals and our outpatient rehabilitation clinics for each of the periods presented 
the data in the tables reflect the changes in the number of specialty hospitals and outpatient rehabilitation clinics we operate that resulted from acquisitions  start up activities  closures and sales

we define adjusted ebitda as net income before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  gain loss on early retirement of debt  stock compensation expense  equity in earnings losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries  other income expense and long term incentive compensation 
we believe that the presentation of adjusted ebitda is important to investors because adjusted ebitda is commonly used as an analytical indicator of performance by investors within the healthcare industry 
adjusted ebitda is used by management to evaluate financial performance and determine resource allocation for each of our 
table of contents operating units 
adjusted ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles 
items excluded from adjusted ebitda are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance 
adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to  or substitute for  net income  cash flows generated by operations  investing or financing activities  or other financial statement data presented in the consolidated financial statements as indicators of financial performance or liquidity 
because adjusted ebitda is not a measurement determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is thus susceptible to varying calculations  adjusted ebitda as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies

our specialty hospital net operating revenues increased by to  million for the year ended december  compared to  million for the year december  the regency hospitals acquired on september  contributed million of net operating revenues in and provided million of the million increase in net operating revenues for the remaining increase primarily resulted from an increase in patient volumes in our other specialty hospitals 
our patient days increased to  days for  which was principally related to the addition of the regency hospitals 
the regency hospitals contributed a net increase in patient days of  days

the occupancy percentage increased to for from for our average net revenue per patient day was  for compared to  for the increase in our net revenue per patient day was principally due to increases in our average medicare net revenue per patient day 
outpatient rehabilitation 
our outpatient rehabilitation net operating revenues increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the net operating revenues generated by our outpatient rehabilitation clinics in grew approximately compared to the increase was principally related to revenues we are generating from services provided to the baylor jv 
the number of patient visits in our owned outpatient rehabilitation clinics decreased for to  visits compared to  visits for the decrease in visits  which also slowed our revenue growth  resulted primarily from the clinics in the dallas fort worth metroplex that were contributed to the baylor jv  which is accounted for as an unconsolidated joint venture 
net revenue per visit in our clinics increased to for  compared to for our contract services business experienced an increase in net operating revenues of approximately compared to which resulted from the addition of new contracts

our operating expenses increased by million to  million for the year ended december  compared to  million for the year ended december  as a percentage of our net operating revenues  our operating expenses were for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  our cost of services  a major component of which is labor expense  were  million for the year ended december  compared to  million for the year ended december  the principal cause of the increase in cost of services resulted from the addition of the regency hospitals 
additionally facility rent expense  which is a component of cost of services  was million for year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses were of net operating revenue or million for the year ended december  compared to of net operating revenue or million for the year ended december  in  our general and administrative expenses included million of non recurring costs related to the transition and closing of the regency corporate office and a million charge due to an increase in employee healthcare costs 
additionally  in there was no incentive compensation paid to our executive officers

in addition to the contribution from the regency hospitals  the increase in the adjusted ebitda for the remainder of our specialty hospitals was primarily the result of an increase in patient volumes and an increase in our medicare net revenue per patient day described above under net operating revenues specialty hospitals 
outpatient rehabilitation 
adjusted ebitda for our outpatient rehabilitation segment was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  our adjusted ebitda margins decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the principal reason for the decrease in the adjusted ebitda margin for the segment was related to our contract services business 
we experienced a decline in the adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin of our contract services business that resulted from the loss of a significant contract during the second quarter of that had generated higher adjusted ebitda margins and higher labor costs for the treatment models required by rugs iv mds rules that became effective on october  the adjusted ebitda in our outpatient rehabilitation clinics increased by million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  additionally  our adjusted ebitda margins for our outpatient rehabilitation clinics grew to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in our adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin in our rehabilitation clinics was principally due to an improvement in the performance in the clinics acquired in from healthsouth corporation and the increase in our net revenue per visit 
other 
the adjusted ebitda loss was million for the year ended december  compared to an adjusted ebitda loss of million for the year ended december  and is primarily related to our general and administrative expenses  as described under operating expenses 
income from operations for the year ended december  we had income from operations of million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in income from operations resulted primarily from the regency hospitals acquired on september  which contributed million of the million increase in income from operations for the year ended december   and improved operating performance at our other specialty hospitals

select medical corporation is part of the consolidated federal tax return for select medical holdings corporation 
we allocate income taxes between select and holdings for purposes of financial statement presentation 
because holdings is a passive investment company incorporated in delaware  it does not incur any state income tax expense or benefit on its specific income or loss and  as such  receives a tax allocation equal to the federal statutory rate of on its specific income or loss 
based upon the relative size of holdings income or loss  this can cause the effective tax rate for select to differ from the effective tax rate for the consolidated company 
the analysis in the following paragraph discusses the change in our consolidated tax rate 
select medical holdings corporation 
we recorded income tax expense of million for the year ended december  the expense represented an effective tax rate of 
we recorded income tax expense of million for the year ended december  the expense represented an effective tax rate of 
although our effective tax rate for the year ended december  approximates our statutory tax rate  the rate was affected by two significant items that offset each other in the effective rate 
we experienced an increase in our effective tax rate from a difference between the tax accounting basis and the financial accounting basis associated with a hospital exchange that occurred in early and an increase in our reserves for uncertain tax positions resulting from the settlement costs associated with the columbus matter 
these increases were offset by a release in reserves for uncertain tax positions associated with the tax basis of an acquisition we consummated in during  additional information was discovered that further supported the tax basis of entities acquired through this acquisition and resulted in a change in the estimates related to this tax uncertainty 
our low effective tax rate for the year ended december  is below the statutory rate due to the reversal of certain valuation allowances that had been provided on losses in previous years 
a substantial portion of this reversal in our valuation allowance relates to our ability to utilize a federal capital loss generated in to offset a taxable capital gain on a recently completed transaction 
non controlling interests non controlling interests in consolidated earnings were million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  
table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  net operating revenues our net operating revenues increased by to  million for the year ended december  compared to  million for the year ended december  specialty hospitals 
our specialty hospital net operating revenues increased by to  million for the year ended december  compared to  million for the year december  the regency hospitals acquired on september  contributed million of the net operating revenue increase and the hospitals we acquired in contributed an additional million of the increased net operating revenues 
our hospitals opened in provided an additional million of the increase 
these increases were offset partially by the loss of revenues from closed and sold hospitals  which accounted for million of the difference in net operating revenues between the year ended december  and december  additionally  net operating revenues for the specialty hospitals opened as of january  and operated by us throughout both periods increased by million to  million for the year ended december   compared to  million for the year ended december  our patient days for these same store hospitals increased and was attributable to an increase in both our medicare and non medicare patient days 
the occupancy percentage in our same store hospitals was for both the year ended december  and december  our average net revenue per patient day in our same store hospitals decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this decline in net revenue per patient day resulted from a decline in our medicare net revenue per patient day associated with the june  interim final rule in which cms adopted a new table of ms ltc drg relative weights that had the effect of reducing reimbursement for medicare cases 
additionally we experienced further reductions in the standard federal rate per case as mandated by the ppaca of effective april  and effective october  these reductions in medicare payments were partially offset by the annual payment update that became effective october  during we also realized additional reimbursement on our outlier cases because higher costs incurred at the free standing hospitals we developed and opened during and had the effect of increasing our net revenue per patient day for outpatient rehabilitation 
our outpatient rehabilitation net operating revenues increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in our outpatient rehabilitation net operating revenues is due to an increase in the volume of patient visits at our outpatient rehabilitation clinics 
the number of patient visits in our outpatient rehabilitation clinics increased for the year ended december  to  visits compared to  visits for the year ended december  the increase in patient visits is principally due to the clinics acquired in december net revenue per visit in our clinics was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  operating expenses our operating expenses include our cost of services  general and administrative expense and bad debt expense 
our operating expenses increased by million to  million for the year ended december  compared to  million for the year ended december  as a percentage of our net operating revenues  our operating expenses were for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  our cost of services  a major component of which is labor expense  were  million for the year ended december  compared to  million for the year ended december  the principal cause of this increase was increased costs associated with the hospital operations acquired in and and higher costs in our same store hospitals 
our labor costs in these same store hospitals in were basis points higher and our other operating costs which are included in costs of services were basis points higher 
our labor costs were primarily higher due to increased patient care hours that resulted from a higher acuity patient population 
additionally  the labor costs in included a million charge due to an increase in our workers compensation program costs incurred during the three months ended september  the increase in our non labor operating costs which are of services  was caused by 
table of contents increasing onsite physician services at certain hospitals  increased equipment leasing costs and increased purchases of minor equipment and supplies 
additionally our facility rent expense  which is a component of these non labor operating costs  was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the change is related to a number of factors 
in our general and administrative expenses were significantly higher because we incurred non recurring charges related to an million payment under the long term cash incentive plan and million in stock compensation expense related to the grant of restricted stock that vested in connection with our initial public offering of common stock 
in  our general and administrative expenses included million of non recurring costs related to the transition and closing of the regency corporate office 
additionally in  we incurred a million charge due to an increase in employee healthcare costs and experienced increases in costs including additional corporate administrative costs to support the regency hospitals 
these increases were offset by a reduction in incentive compensation for executive officers of million for compared to our bad debt expense as a percentage of net operating revenue declined slightly to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  adjusted ebitda specialty hospitals 
adjusted ebitda for our specialty hospitals decreased by to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  our adjusted ebitda margins decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the hospitals opened as of january  and operated by us throughout both periods had adjusted ebitda of million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or over the adjusted ebitda of million for these hospitals for the year ended december  our adjusted ebitda margin in these same store hospitals decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the principal reason for the decline in our adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin for these same store hospitals was a decline in our net revenue per patient day due to a decline in payment rates and higher relative costs of services as a percentage of net operating revenues 
these changes were described above under net operating revenues specialty hospitals and operating expenses 
we experienced a slight reduction in the bad debt expense in these hospitals which had the effect of increasing our adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin 
the hospitals acquired in and had adjusted ebitda of million for compared to adjusted ebitda losses of million in our hospitals opened during and incurred adjusted ebitda losses of million in compared to million in our closed and sold hospitals had adjusted ebitda losses of million in compared to million in outpatient rehabilitation 
adjusted ebitda for our outpatient rehabilitation segment was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  our adjusted ebitda margins decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease in adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin was primarily the result of a decline in the performance of our contract services business 
this decline was due to the loss of a significant group of locations where our contract was cancelled when our customer sold its business 
this was a long term mature contract that had historically generated higher adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margins than our typical contracts 
additionally  our contract services group has secured new contracts to replace the lost business  although these new contracts have generated lower adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margins during their start up period 
we also experienced higher labor costs in our contract services business during the fourth quarter of as we adjusted our treatment models to adapt to rugs iv mds rules that became effective on october  other 
the adjusted ebitda loss was million for the year ended december  compared to an adjusted ebitda loss of million for the year ended december  and is primarily related to our general and administrative expenses 
this increased loss is related to general and administrative expenses described above under operating expenses and was principally related to million of additional costs we incurred associated with the transition and closing of the regency corporate office 
the remainder of the increase 
table of contents is due to increases in our costs including additional corporate administrative costs to support the regency hospitals 
the non recurring charges incurred in  million payment under the long term cash incentive plan and million in stock compensation expense related to the grant of restricted stock  are excluded from the computation of adjusted ebitda 
income from operations for the year ended december  we experienced income from operations of million compared to million for the year ended december  the small increase in our income from operations is principally related to a reduction in our general and administrative expenses described above offset in part by a decline in profitability of our specially hospitals opened as of january  and operated throughout both periods
