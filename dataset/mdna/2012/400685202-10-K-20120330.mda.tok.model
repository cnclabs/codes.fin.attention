business overview the company operates its business through its indirect wholly owned subsidiary  guanwei  which is located in fuqing city  fujian province  prc 
guanwei imports and recycles ldpe plastic scrap material into granular plastic for use in the manufacture of various consumer products  and is one of the largest manufacturers of recycled ldpe in china 
critical accounting policies  estimates and assumptions accounting principles our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements 
these financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us gaap  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues and expenditures  to disclose contingent assets and liabilities on the date of the financial statements  and to disclose the reported amounts of revenues and expenses incurred during the financial reporting period 
the most significant estimates and assumptions include revenues recognition  valuation of inventories  and provisions for income taxes 
we continue to evaluate these estimates and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we rely on these evaluations as the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
some of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
we believe critical accounting policies as disclosed in this annual report reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our financial statements 
we believe there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates 
the following critical accounting policies rely upon assumptions and estimates and were used in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements a revenue recognition revenue from sales of manufactured ldpe is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the goods has occurred  and customer acceptance has been obtained  which means the significant risks and ownership have been transferred to the customer  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
from time to time  revenue is deferred for upfront payments for sales of recycled ldpe received and is included in accrued expenses and other payables until the significant risks and ownership of the goods have been transferred to the customers and the price is fixed and collectability is reasonably assured 
sales of non ldpe waste materials are recognized on the same basis as sales of ldpe 
b inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost  on a first in first out method  or market value 
costs include purchase and related costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition 
market value is calculated based on the estimated normal selling price  less further costs expected to be incurred for disposal 
provisions are made for obsolete  slow moving or defective items  where appropriate 
we estimate the net realizable value for such finished goods and work in progress based primarily upon the latest invoice prices and current market conditions 
if the market value of an inventory drops below its carrying value  we record a write off to cost of sales for the difference between the carrying cost and the market value 
during the years ended december  and  the company recorded no inventory write down 
we carry out an inventory review at each quarter end 
c income taxes in the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
the registrant and its subsidiaries  with the exception of guanwei  generated no taxable income 
current income taxes are provided for in accordance with the laws of the relevant taxing authorities 
we account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income tax purposes 
under the asset and liability method  deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences  net operating loss carry forwards and credits by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we conduct this analysis on a quarterly basis 
as of december   the company has undistributed profits of approximately  that are subject to withholding tax when distributed 
since the company intends to reinvest these undistributed profits to further expand its businesses and does not intend to declare dividends  the company has not recorded a withholding tax in relation to these undistributed profits 
should the company s distribute all these profits  the aggregate withholding tax will amount to approximately  which the tax rate is currently at of the undistributed earnings prepared under prc gaap after the company has no material uncertain tax positions as of december  or unrecognized tax benefit which would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in future periods 
the company classifies interest and or penalties related to income tax matters as an income tax expense 
as of december   there is no interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions 
the company does not anticipate any significant increases or decreases to its liability for unrecognized tax benefits within the next months 
d recently adopted accounting standards in may  the fasb issued a new accounting standard update asu no 
 fair value measurements topic  which amends the fair value measurement guidance and includes some enhanced disclosure requirements 
the most significant change in disclosures is an expansion of the information required for level measurements based on unobservable inputs 
the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures 
in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income topic  an amendment to an existing accounting standard which requires companies to present net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement or in two separate  but consecutive  statements 
in addition  in december  the fasb issued an amendment to an existing accounting standard which defers the requirement to present components of reclassifications of other comprehensive income on the face of the income statement 
the company adopted both standards in the fourth quarter of such adoption did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
results of operations for the fiscal year ended december  compared to the fiscal year ended december  the following table sets forth a summary of certain key components of our results of operations for the years indicated  in usd 
for the fiscal year ended december  change in net revenue   cost of revenue   gross profit   selling and marketing expenses   general and administrative expenses   interest income   interest expenses   income taxes   net income   revenues the following table sets forth a summary of our net revenue by categories for the periods indicated  in usd 
for the fiscal year ended december  change in sales of recycled ldpe manufactured   purchased  sales of non ldpe   our revenues are derived from the sales of recycled ldpe and non ldpe waste materials 
we manufacture recycled ldpe from plastic waste and occasionally purchase recycled ldpe from other manufacturers for resale when market conditions justify doing so 
the raw materials ie plastic waste we use in our operation generally contain approximately of non ldpe plastic waste  such as polyethylene terephthalate  polypropylene  or acrylonitrile butadiene styrene 
we sort and classify this non ldpe material and sell it to other recycled plastic manufacturers who use these products 
during the fiscal year  the company completed construction projects involving our washing and smashing plant 
the washing and smashing plant is a key component in the company s manufacturing process 
after being sorted from the non ldpe material  all ldpe material is smashed and cut into pieces by one of eight smashing machines before being washed and cleaned several times in order to eliminate impurities 
after completion of the construction projects  the washing pools were drained and excavated to increase their depth  some components of the pools vortex pumps were replaced  and the engine size of the pumps was enlarged to enhance their efficiency 
the improved washing pools allow the company to enhance the whiteness of the recycled ldpe material  which results in a higher grade end product 
this is particularly desirable for the many customers who mix recycled ldpe with virgin plastics in their production processes and who typically have strict color requirements 
in late  construction was completed on the new raw material storage field 
our storage facility in use is now more than  square meters 
raw materials were relocated to the new storage facility and the old raw material warehouse was converted for expansion of the company s classification and sorting operations  which will allow for future increases in production capacity 
revenue generated during the fiscal year from the sale of manufactured recycled ldpe was  as compared to  for  which represents an increase of 
this increase was due to an increase in both sales volume and selling price of manufactured recycled ldpe 
the company sold  tons of manufactured recycled ldpe in the year ended december   representing an increase of from the  tons sold in the average selling price of recycled ldpe increased from approximately  per ton in to approximately  per ton in during the fiscal year  we purchased recycled ldpe from other recycled manufacturers for resale in order to meet the demand from certain of our customers 
the product quality of recycled ldpe purchased from other recycled plastic manufacturers was moderate and accordingly the gross profit margin of such purchased recycled ldpe was low 
revenue generated during the year ended december  from the sales of purchased recycled ldpe was  during the fiscal year  we did not enter into this type of transactions and generated no such revenue 
revenue generated from the sales of sorted non ldpe material increased from  in to  in  representing an increase of 
this was due to an increase in both sales volume and selling price 
guanwei sold  tons of sorted non ldpe material in  representing an increase of from  tons sold in the same period of a higher volume of non ldpe material was sold during the fiscal year because our production of ldpe material increased 
since non ldpe material is a by product of manufacturing our ldpe products  the increase of our sales of non ldpe material is in line with the increase of our ldpe product sales 
the average selling price of sorted non ldpe material increased to approximately per ton in from approximately per ton in as with recycled ldpe  the average selling price of sorted non ldpe materials has increased steadily since the first quarter of our revenue may be affected by the import quotas granted by the prc s ministry of environmental protection 
on july   guanwei received official government approval for expansion of its quota for imported plastic waste 
pursuant to the approval  the guanwei s import quota increased from  tons to  tons in guanwei entered into an agreement  dated november   pursuant to which guanwei has been permitted to use  at no cost  the  tons per year import quota granted to fuqing huan li plastics company limited huan li for a term of years 
chen min  our chief executive officer and chairman of the board  is also the chief executive officer  chairman of the board and legal representative of huan li 
there can be no guarantee that huan li s import quota will be available to us after the expiration of the agreement 
if we are unable to use huan li s import quota or obtain the grant of an import quota from the ministry of environment protection  our revenue and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
please refer to the section entitled risk factors in our annual report on form k for further information and other factors that may affect our revenue 
together with the import quota of  tons contracted from huan li  the company had a total import quota of  tons in other than as disclosed elsewhere in this annual report  we are unaware of any trends or uncertainties which have or which we reasonably expect to have a material impact on net sales or revenues from continued operations 
cost of revenue for the fiscal year ended december  of net revenue for the fiscal year ended december  of net revenue change in costs of manufactured recycled ldpe and sorted non ldpe material costs of purchased recycled ldpe  during the years ended december  and  our cost of revenue was  and  representing and of net revenue 
during the years ended december  and  our cost of revenue from sales of manufactured recycled ldpe and sorted non ldpe material was  and  representing and of net revenue from sales of manufactured recycled ldpe and sorted non ldpe material 
the increase in the percentage of cost to net revenue is primarily due to raw material costs increasing at a faster pace than the increase in our selling price 
raw material prices increased  from per ton in to per ton in  while the average selling prices of manufactured recycled ldpe and sorted non ldpe material increased and  respectively  from  per ton and per ton in to  per ton and per ton in in order to cut costs and increase profit margins  guanwei focuses heavily on developing relationships with new suppliers and increasing the amount of high quality raw material purchased directly from european suppliers  as opposed to purchasing from a wholesaler 
guanwei will continue to work on developing such relationships  and obtaining more favorable terms and discounts by strengthening our relationship with suppliers and placing more bulk orders 
gross profit the overall gross profit for increased to  compared to  for during the fiscal year  our overall gross profit margin decreased to from in the decrease in overall gross profit margin was primarily attributable to our raw material cost increasing at a faster rate than the increase in our selling price of recycled ldpe 
the gross profit margins of purchased recycled ldpe in were 
we did not enter into any sales of purchased recycled ldpe in gross profit from sales of manufactured recycled ldpe and sorted non ldpe material during increased by  to  or of net revenue  from  for the increase in gross profit was primarily the result of the increase in selling price and sales volume 
during  the sales volume of manufactured recycled ldpe and sorted non ldpe material increased and  respectively  and their average selling prices increased and  respectively 
the average per ton manufacturing cost of recycled ldpe and sorted non ldpe material during continued to climb at a faster pace than the increase of our selling prices 
gross profit from sales of purchased recycled ldpe during was  or of net revenue from sales of purchased recycled ldpe 
the company had previously sold purchased recycled ldpe in  but upon considering the low quality of purchased recycled ldpe and the low profit margin contributed by such resale  the company decided to discontinue reselling purchased recycled ldpe in however  during the third quarter of  the company generated revenue of  from sale of purchased recycled ldpe only to meet the demand of certain of its existing customers 
we did not enter into such revenue in as previously discussed  the company s improved washing and smashing plant and new raw material storage facility were put into use in the period 
the company s sales volume of manufactured recycled ldpe material increased to  tons in from  tons in furthermore  in order to reduce costs and secure availability of material supply  the company will continue to work on obtaining more favorable terms and a sustainable supply of raw materials by strengthening our relationship with suppliers and developing long term supply arrangements 
operating expenses sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of transportation and courier costs  payroll and related benefits 
in  sales and marketing expenses increased to  compared to  for the increase was primarily caused by an increase of payroll and related benefit costs as a result of an increase in head count and a continuing increase in payroll cost per employee 
our payroll cost increased to  in from  in in addition  our delivery cost also increased substantially due to a continued increase in our sales and gasoline prices 
our customers may choose to either pick up their products with their own vehicles or to have the company arrange delivery  in which case the transportation costs are categorized as selling and marketing expenses 
total transportation costs for and were  and  respectively 
the company believes this trend will continue in the foreseeable future 
general and administrative expenses primarily consist of management remuneration  depreciation and amortization  employee welfare costs  and legal and professional fees 
during  general and administrative expenses increased to  compared to  in this increase was primarily due to the following the increase in payroll expenses for management  which increased to  for from  for due to the rising costs of remuneration packages related to recruiting and maintaining skilled executives  the increase in pension contributions to  for from  for  an increase of  or  due to increased mandatory coverage imposed by the government  the increase in depreciation and amortization expenses to  for from  for  an increase of  or  due to an increase of amortization expense related a significant improvement to our facility during  and a foreign exchange loss of  in  which increased  or as compared to a foreign exchange loss of  in other income expenses our interest income is generated by interest earned on deposits with banks and financial institutions and interest expenses are amounts we pay in interest with respect to our borrowings 
the increase in interest income of  to  for from  for  is due to more cash available to be deposited at the banks as a result of our higher profits in interest expenses decreased as a result of borrowings paid off in the first quarter of therefore  we did not incur any interest expenses in the second half of we support our operations through a combination of self generated profit and limited amount of loans from banks and financial institutions 
as of december   we had short term borrowings of  including a loan payable to fuqing rural credit cooperative union in the amount of  and a loan payable to china merchants bank in the amount of  both loans were repaid in full in as of december   we did not have any outstanding borrowings as we have sufficient working capital to meet our short term cash needs 
net income during the year ended december   our net income increased to  as compared to  for the improvement is primarily due to overall increased sales of recycled ldpe 
the net income increased at a lower percentage than the increase of our revenue  primarily due to the increase of cost of raw material at a higher rate than that of our net revenue  which was partially offset by operating expenses increase at a lower rate than that of revenue 
in order to continue to improve gross margin and net profit margin  we intend to focus on enhancing our manufacturing techniques and improving our labor efficiency 
additionally  we will continue to strengthen our relationships with our major suppliers to obtain more favorable terms  and we will enhance management control over general and administrative expenses 
inflation inflationary factors  such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs  may adversely affect our operating results 
although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date  a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs 
foreign exchange a majority of our net revenue and expenditures are denominated in the renminbi 
however  the price of raw materials that we buy from foreign suppliers is primarily denominated in the us dollar and european union euro 
as a result  fluctuations in the exchange rate between the european union euro or the us dollar and the renminbi will affect the cost of such raw materials to us and will affect our results of operations and financial condition 
approximately and of our purchases for the fiscal year ended december  were denominated in the us dollar and the european union euro  and the rest of our purchases were denominated in the renminbi 
accordingly we believe that any movement in the exchange rate between the european union euro and the renminbi will have insignificant impact on our operating income 
the exchange rate between the renminbi and the us dollar is subject to the prc government s foreign currency conversion policies  which may change at any time 
the exchange rates at december  and were approximately and renminbi to us dollar  respectively 
any devaluation of the renminbi against the us dollar would consequently have an adverse effect on our financial performance and asset values when measured in terms of us dollars 
we recognized a foreign currency translation gain of approximately  and  for the fiscal year ended december  and if the exchange rate were to increase by to us rmb at december   our foreign currency translation gain would potentially decrease by approximately  for the year ended december  if the exchange rate were to decrease by to us rmb at december   our foreign currency translation gain would potentially increase by approximately  for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources we generally finance our operations through operating profit and through short term borrowings from banks and financial institutions 
as of december   we had two outstanding loans payable 
the short term loan from fuqing rural credit cooperative union bore interest at a fixed rate of per annum with the maturity date of january   and was secured by the company s building and land use right 
the loan was fully repaid on january  a short term loan arrangement with china merchants bank allowed the company to draw on the same loan several times during each of the draws were due in months from the date of drawing and bore interest at rates ranging from to 
these short term loans were secured by the company s restricted cash  which amounted to  as of december  the loan was fully repaid in and the restricted cash was released 
as of december   we did not have any outstanding borrowings as we have sufficient working capital to meet our short term cash needs 
as of the date of this annual report  we have not experienced any difficulties due to a shortage of capital  we have not experienced any difficulty in raising funds through loans from banks and financial institutions  and we have not experienced any liquidity problems in settling our payables in the normal course of business and repaying our loans when they come due 
we are unaware of any trends  demands  commitments events or uncertainties that will result or be likely to result in material changes in our liquidity 
we believe that the level of financial resources is a significant factor for our future development and  accordingly  we may determine from time to time to raise capital through private debt or equity financing to strengthen the company s financial position  to expand our facilities and to provide us with additional flexibility to take advantage of business opportunities 
no assurances can be given that we will be successful in raising such additional capital on terms acceptable to us 
the following table sets forth the summary of our cash flows  in usd  for the fiscal years ended december  and year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities   net cash used for investing activities   net cash used for provided by financing activities  effect of exchange rate changes on cash   net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents  cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year  cash and cash equivalents at end of year  operating activities during the year ended december   we generated net cash from operating activities of  as compared to  for the decrease is primarily due to the increase of accounts receivable of  and the increase of inventories of  the decrease in net cash from operating activities is partially offset by the increase of net income to  for from  for and the increase of accounts payable of  investing activities during the fiscal year ended december   net cash used for investing activities was  representing an increase of  as compared to  of net cash used for investing activities in the increase of net cash used in investing activities in is primarily attributable to increased capital expenditures related to the building improvements and other factory equipment purchases in the amount of  in during the fiscal year ended december   we incurred capital expenditure of  related to factory equipment 
financing activities net cash used for financing activities for the fiscal year ended december  was  representing a decrease of  compared to  net cash provided by financing activities in the decrease is primarily due to repayments of the short term borrowings of  in  which is partially offset by the release of restricted cash in the amount of  as a result of the repayment of our short term borrowings and advances from a shareholder of  to pay certain professional fees 
we received short term borrowings proceeds of  and advances from a shareholder of  to pay certain professional fees in  which is offset by bank borrowing repayments of  and an increase in restricted cash of  as a condition of bank borrowings in working capital our working capital as of december  was  compared to working capital of  as of december   representing an increase of 
the improved working capital is mainly due to the net operating cash flows generated from the increases of our net income 
we aim to continue to improve the level of working capital through the enhanced level of productivity and increased revenue and efficiently controlling costs 
dividends we are a holding company with no material operations of our own 
we conduct our operations primarily through our prc operating subsidiary in china 
as a result  our ability to pay dividends and to finance any debt we may incur depends upon dividends paid by our prc operating subsidiary 
if our prc subsidiary or any newly formed subsidiaries incur debt on their own behalf in the future  the instruments governing their debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends to us 
in addition  our prc operating subsidiary is permitted to pay dividends to us only out of its retained earnings  if any  as determined in accordance with prc accounting standards and regulations 
under prc laws and regulations  our prc operating subsidiary is required to allocate at least of its after tax profits each year  if any  to prc statutory reserves before distributing dividends until the balance of such fund has reached of its registered capital 
our prc operating subsidiary with foreign investment is also required to further set aside a portion of its after tax profits to fund the employee welfare fund at the discretion of the board 
although the prc statutory reserves can be used  among other ways  to increase the registered capital and eliminate future losses in excess of retained earnings of the prc operating subsidiary  the reserve funds are not distributable as cash dividends except in the event of liquidation of the prc operating subsidiary 
foreign cash as of december  and  the company had cash deposits of million and million placed with several banks and a financial institution in the people s republic of china  where there is currently no rule or regulation in place for obligatory insurance of accounts with banks and financial institutions 
if the foreign cash and cash equivalents are expatriated to finance any needs of our operations in the us  we may need to accrue and pay us taxes 
currently  we have not provided for us income and foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings of our prc operating subsidiary since we intend to reinvest our earnings to further expand our businesses in mainland china and do not intend to declare dividends to our us holding company in the foreseeable future
