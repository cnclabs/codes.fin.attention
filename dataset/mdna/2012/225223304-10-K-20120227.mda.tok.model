item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements the information set forth in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below includes forward looking statements as described in the section forward looking statements preceding part i of this annual report on form k  and is subject to the safe harbor created by section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including the risks faced by us and described in item a 
risk factors in part i and other sections of this report and our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
the following discussion should also be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto 
overview and executive summary we design  develop  manufacture  market and service high performance computing  or hpc  systems  commonly known as supercomputers  and provide storage solutions and engineering services related to hpc systems and solutions to our customers  which include government agencies  academic institutions and commercial entities 
our supercomputer systems provide capability and sustained performance far beyond typical server based computer systems and address challenging scientific  engineering  commercial and national security computing problems 
our current strategy is to gain market share in the high end supercomputer market segment  extend our technology leadership  maintain our focus on execution and profitability and expand our addressable market in areas where we can leverage our experience and technology  such as in storage data management  big data analytics  midrange hpc systems and custom engineered solutions 
summary of results revenue decreased by million in compared to to million 
product revenue decreased by million and service revenue increased by million 
the decrease in product revenue was principally the result of our inability to complete the acceptance process of the cray xk upgrade at oak ridge national laboratory due to supply issues related to a key component  which resulted in a delay in the recognition of the associated revenue 
as our revenue is driven by relatively few  large transactions  significant variability in annual and quarterly results is expected 
if the oak ridge national laboratory acceptance had not been delayed  our revenue would have been approximately million higher and the decreases in revenue and product revenue would have been less pronounced 
additionally  product revenue from sales of our external storage systems was lower in gross profit margin from services was higher in compared to on approximately the same revenue 
the higher service gross profit margin was partially attributable to higher margins on maintenance services due to an increased number of systems in the field with low associated variable costs 
also contributing to the increase in service gross profit margin was an additional million in revenue recorded on a custom engineering contract in  where the associated costs were recorded in prior periods  as revenue was recognized on the cash basis as our ability to collect payment was not reasonably assured 
we recorded income from operations of million in compared to income from operations of million in total gross profit decreased million in from due to lower product revenue 
this was partially offset by higher gross profit on service revenue 
operating expenses increased million principally due to lower reimbursements for research and development from our darpa hpcs phase iii program  which was largely offset by lower incentive compensation expense and outside services expense 
incentive compensation costs are principally driven by pre bonus operating income and  to a lesser extent  product revenue 
net income decreased from million in to million in net income in includes million 
per diluted share attributable to a partial reduction of the valuation allowance held against our us deferred tax assets and a complete reduction of the valuation allowance held against the deferred tax assets of our german subsidiary 
net cash used in operations during was million  as compared to net cash used in operations of million in the decrease in net cash used in operations was principally due to higher collections from customers  partially offset by higher inventory levels on hand at the end of 
table of contents market overview and challenges significant trends in the hpc industry include the commoditization of hpc hardware  particularly processors and interconnect systems  the growing commoditization of software  including plentiful building blocks and more capable open source software  supercomputing with many core commodity processors driving increasing scalability requirements  electrical power requirements becoming a design constraint and driver in total cost of ownership determinations  increased micro architectural diversity  including increased usage of many core processors and growing experimentation with accelerators  as the rate of per core performance increases slows  and data needs growing faster than computational needs 
several of these trends have resulted in the expansion and acceptance of lower bandwidth cluster systems using processors manufactured by intel  amd and others combined with commercially available commodity networking and other components  particularly in the middle and lower segments of the hpc market 
these systems may offer higher theoretical peak performance for equivalent cost  and price peak performance is often the dominant factor in hpc procurements outside of the high end supercomputer market segment 
vendors of such systems often put pricing pressure on us in competitive procurements 
in the markets for the largest systems  those costing significantly in excess of million  the use of commodity components can result in increasing data transfer bottlenecks as these components do not balance processor power with network communication capability 
with the arrival of increasing processor core counts due to new many core processors  these unbalanced systems will typically have even lower productivity  especially in larger systems running more complex applications 
we and other vendors have also begun to augment standard microprocessors with other processor types  such as field programmable gate arrays and graphics processing units  in order to increase computational power  further complicating programming models 
in addition  with increasing scale  bandwidth and processor core counts  large computer systems use progressively higher amounts of power to operate and require special cooling capabilities 
to position ourselves to meet the market s demanding needs  we concentrate our research and development efforts on technologies that enable our supercomputers to perform at scale that is  to continue to increase actual performance as systems grow ever larger in size and in areas where we can leverage our core expertize in other markets 
we also have demonstrated expertise in several processor technologies 
we expect to be in a comparatively advantageous position as larger many core processors become available and as multiple processing technologies become integrated into single systems in heterogeneous environments 
in addition  we intend to expand our addressable market by leveraging our technologies and customer base  the cray brand and industry trends by introducing complementary products and services to new and existing customers  as demonstrated by our emphasis on strategic initiatives  such as storage data management  big data analytics  midrange hpc systems and custom engineered solutions 

table of contents key performance indicators our management monitors and analyzes several key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance  including revenue 
product revenue generally constitutes the major portion of our revenue in any reporting period and  for the reasons discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k  is subject to significant variability from period to period 
in the short term  we closely review the status of product shipments  installations and acceptances in order to forecast revenue and cash receipts  longer term  we monitor the status of the pipeline of product sales opportunities and product development cycles 
product revenue growth over several quarters is an indicator of whether we are achieving our objective of increased market share in the supercomputing market 
the introduction of the cray xe and cray xk families and our longer term product roadmap are efforts to increase product revenue 
we are also increasing our business and product development efforts on certain new initiatives such as storage data management  big data analytics  midrange hpc systems and custom engineered solutions 
maintenance service revenue is more constant in the short term and assists  in part  to offset the impact that the variability in product revenue has on total revenue 
gross profit margin 
our product gross profit margin was in and service gross profit margin increased from in to in the increase in service gross profit margin is due to higher margins from our maintenance services due to an increased number of systems in the field with low associated variable costs and an additional million in revenue recorded on a custom engineering contract in where revenue was recognized on the cash basis  where the associated costs were recorded in prior periods  as our ability to collect payment was not reasonably assured 
the increase in our service gross margin drove the increase in our total gross profit margin from in to in operating expenses 
our operating expenses are driven largely by headcount  the level of recognized co funding for research and development  contracted third party research and development services  and incentive compensation 
as part of our ongoing efforts to control operating expenses  we monitor headcount levels in specific geographic and operational areas 
liquidity and cash flows 
due to the variability in product revenue  new contracts  and payment terms  our cash position also varies significantly from quarter to quarter and within a quarter 
we monitor our expected cash levels  particularly in light of increased inventory purchases for large system installations and the risk of delays in product shipments and acceptances and  longer term  in product development 
cash receipts often lag customer acceptances and  because we had a number of large customer acceptances in the fourth quarter of  we anticipate significant cash receipts in the first quarter of 
table of contents results of operations revenue and gross profit our product and service revenue for the indicated years ended december were in thousands  except for percentages year ended december  product revenue less cost of product revenue product gross profit product gross profit percentage service revenue less cost of service revenue service gross profit service gross profit percentage total revenue less total cost of revenue total gross profit total gross profit percentage product revenue product revenue in decreased million  or  over principally due to our inability to complete the acceptance process of the cray xk upgrade at oak ridge national laboratory in  which resulted in a delay in the recognition of the associated revenue 
additionally  revenue from sales of our external storage systems was lower in as fewer customers implemented large storage systems during the year 
product revenue in increased million  or  over due primarily to the release of the cray xe system and higher external storage sales as part of our data management practice 
service revenue service revenue for increased million from lower revenues on certain custom engineering projects were offset by a million increase in revenue from our maintenance and support group due to an increased number of systems in the field 
custom engineering service revenue in included an additional million in revenue recorded on a contract in where revenue was recognized on the cash basis as our ability to collect payment was not reasonably assured 
service revenue for decreased million  or  from primarily due to our inability to record revenue on a custom engineering contract in for services that were performed but where not all revenue recognition criteria had been met 
cost of product revenue and product gross profit cost of product revenue for decreased by million compared to driven by lower product revenue 
product gross profit percentage in was unchanged from the gross profit percentage in of 
lower component costs  principally memory  contributed to maintaining product gross margin levels in this was partially offset by penalties incurred on product acceptances resulting from delays in the availability of a key component 
product gross profit percentage improved one percentage point in compared to the improvement in product gross profit percentage was due to lower charges for excess and obsolete inventory of million in compared to million in cost of product revenue increased million due to higher product revenue partially offset by lower charges for excess and obsolete inventory 

table of contents cost of service revenue and service gross profit cost of service revenue decreased million and service gross profit margin increased by percentage points to in compared to the increase in service gross profit margin was due to increases in revenue from our maintenance and support group from the large systems that were accepted in the fourth quarter of with a minimal increase in costs and an additional million in revenue in recorded on a custom engineering contract where revenue was being recorded on a cash basis  where the associated costs were recorded in prior periods  as the company s ability to collect payment was not reasonably assured 
the company s workforce reductions in march and other cost reduction actions also contributed to an increase in service gross profit for service gross profit percentage declined percentage points and cost of service revenue increased million in as compared to custom engineering service revenue was negatively impacted by the transition of certain projects from development service revenue to production product revenue 
in addition  revenue was not recognized on a contract in for services that were performed but where not all revenue recognition criteria had been met  while related project costs were expensed in operating expenses research and development research and development expenses for the indicated years ended december were as follows in thousands  except for percentages gross research and development expenses less amounts included in cost of revenue less reimbursed research and development excludes amounts in revenue net research and development expenses percentage of total revenue gross research and development expenses in the table above reflect all research and development expenditures 
research and development expenses include personnel expenses  depreciation  allocations for certain overhead expenses  software  prototype materials and outside contracted expenses 
in february and again in october  we amended the phase iii agreement with darpa 
as with the previous contract  we expect to receive reimbursement after the achievement of a series of predefined milestones culminating in the delivery of a prototype system 
consistent with the changes  certain deliverables have been eliminated from the contract  reducing the overall scope and cost of the project 
pursuant to the amended contract  the full co funding amount was revised to million from million 
as of december   we had earned and received million of reimbursement under the darpa phase iii agreement  leaving million to be earned and received 
we expect to earn and receive the remaining million in in  gross research and development expenses decreased million from levels primarily due to decreased incentive based compensation expense and lower third party service expenses  partially offset by higher salary expense resulting from higher headcount 
reimbursed research and development decreased million in compared to due to million less in reimbursements recognized in connection with our darpa hpcs phase iii project as we passed two milestones in compared to three milestones in in  gross research and development expenses decreased million from primarily due to lower spending on the darpa hpcs phase iii project  as a result of lower third party costs  primarily related to a modification in the darpa contract  which was partially offset by higher incentive based compensation expenses 
reimbursed research and development increased by million in compared to due to higher darpa hpcs phase iii reimbursements as we passed three milestones in compared to passing two milestones in 
table of contents other operating expenses our sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses for the indicated years ended december were in thousands  except for percentages year ended december  sales and marketing percentage of total revenue general and administrative percentage of total revenue restructuring percentage of total revenue sales and marketing 
the million decrease in sales and marketing expenses in compared to was due principally to lower incentive based compensation and lower commissions 
the million increase in sales and marketing expenses in compared to was due principally to million in higher commissions on higher revenues  increased headcount in strategic initiatives and higher other incentive based compensation 
general and administrative 
the million decrease in general and administrative expenses in compared to was primarily due to lower incentive based compensation and lower salary expense due to lower headcount 
the million increase in general and administrative expenses in compared to was primarily due to higher incentive based compensation 
restructuring 
restructuring expenses in were primarily due to the elimination of positions in our workforce rebalancing announced in march other expense  net we recorded million and million of net other expense for the years ended december  and  respectively  principally due to foreign exchange transaction losses 
for the year ended december   we recognized million of net other expense due principally to foreign exchange transaction gains offset by a million loss on the repurchase of million principal amount of our convertible senior subordinated notes due in notes 
interest income expense  net our interest income and interest expense for the years ended december were in thousands year ended december  interest income interest expense net interest income expense interest income in decreased as compared to due to lower average invested balances and lower short term interest rates 
interest income in was consistent with interest income in the higher interest expense in compared to and resulted from outstanding convertible debt that was fully repurchased in late taxes we recorded an income tax benefit of million in  income tax expense of million in  and an income tax benefit of million in 
table of contents an income tax benefit  in the amount of million 
per diluted share  was recorded in as a result of the partial reduction of the valuation allowance held against the company s us deferred tax assets  as well as to a much lesser extent the complete reduction of the valuation allowance held against the deferred tax assets of the company s german subsidiary 
the foregoing tax benefit was partially offset by income taxes due in the us and certain foreign jurisdictions 
income tax expense recorded in related primarily to higher pre tax earnings 
the income tax benefit recorded in related primarily to the partial reduction of the valuation allowance held against the deferred tax assets of our japanese subsidiary and a million benefit recorded as a result of tax legislation that enabled a corporation to recover certain previously generated us income tax credits  offset somewhat by income taxes due in the us and various foreign jurisdictions 
the partial reduction of the valuation allowance held against the company s us deferred tax assets and the complete reduction of the valuation allowance held against the deferred tax assets of our german subsidiary was based upon an evaluation of all available positive and negative evidence 
we consider our actual historical results over several years to have stronger weight than other more subjective indicators  including forecasts  when considering whether to establish or reduce a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
as of december  we have generated cumulative pre tax income in recent years 
in addition to our cumulative income position  our assessment of our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets included an assessment of all known business risks and industry trends  as well as forecasted domestic and international earnings over a number of years 
our ability to forecast results significantly into the future is severely limited due to the rapid rate of technological change in the industry in which we operate 
included in our forecast was the impact of two unusually large contracts that were finalized during the fourth quarter of  namely a million contract with the university of illinois national center for supercomputing applications and a million contract with the department of energy s oak ridge national laboratory 
our conclusion about the realizability of our deferred tax assets and therefore the appropriateness of the valuation allowance will be reviewed quarterly and could change in future periods depending on our future assessment of all available evidence in support of the likelihood of realization of our deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million that will expire between through  if not utilized 
liquidity and capital resources we generate cash from operations predominantly from the sale of high performance computer systems and related services 
we typically have a small number of significant contracts that make up the majority of total revenue 
the material changes in certain of our balance sheet accounts were due to the timing of product deliveries  customer acceptances  contractually determined billings and cash collections 
working capital requirements  including inventory purchases and normal capital expenditures  are generally funded with cash from operations 
inventory increased from million at december  to million at december  as certain systems and system upgrades had been delivered to customer sites but had not completed the acceptance process as of december  partially offsetting these impacts on our liquidity position has been a decrease in accounts and other receivables from million at december  to million at december  as we received a higher number of customer acceptances in the fourth quarter of than the final payments for these systems are not due until early in the following year 
in early we anticipate that our cash position will improve  at least in part  as we collect payment for the receivables related to significant system acceptances in late fourth quarter and in the first part of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled million at december  compared to million at december  as of december   we had working capital of million compared to million as of december  cash flow information for the years ended december included the following in thousands operating activities investing activities financing activities 
table of contents operating activities 
net cash used in operating activities was million and million in and  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in for the year ended december   cash used in operating activities was principally the result of a significant increase in inventory partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable 
for the year ended december   cash used by operating activities was principally the result of a large increase in accounts receivable due to final billings related to fourth quarter acceptances due in early for the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities was principally the result of significant decreases in accounts receivable and inventory 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million in net cash provided by investing activities was million in net cash used in investing activities was million in for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities was principally the result of purchases of property and equipment 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by investing activities was a result of the sale of million in short term investments and a million decrease in restricted cash  offset by property and equipment purchases of million 
for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities was principally the result of purchases of property and equipment 
financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in net cash provided by financing activities was million in net cash used in financing activities was million in for the years ended december  and  net cash provided by financing activities was due primarily to proceeds from stock option exercises and stock purchases from our employee stock purchase plan 
for the year ended december   net cash used in financing activities was due primarily to million of cash paid to repurchase our notes 
as of december   there was no outstanding balance on our notes 
over the next twelve months  we expect our significant cash requirements will relate to operational expenses  consisting primarily of personnel costs  costs of inventory associated with certain large scale product deliveries  spare parts  outside engineering expenses  and the acquisition of property and equipment 
in addition  we lease certain equipment and facilities used in our operations under operating leases in the normal course of business 
the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december  in thousands amounts committed by year contractual obligations total year years years thereafter development agreements operating leases total contractual cash obligations we have a line of credit with wells fargo bank  national association of million which has a maturity date of june  in september  we entered into a secured line of credit with silicon valley bank in the amount of million 
the first million is available at any time and the additional million is available if certain minimum financial ratios are exceeded 
our line of credit with silicon valley bank has a maturity date of september  we made no draws in nor are there any outstanding borrowings on these lines of credit as of december  in our normal course of operations  we have development arrangements under which we engage outside engineering resources to work on our research and development projects 
for the year ended december   we incurred million for such arrangements 
at any particular time  our cash position is affected by the timing of cash receipts for product sales  maintenance contracts  government co funding for research and development activities and our payments for inventory  resulting in significant fluctuations in our cash balance from quarter to quarter and within a quarter 
our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and cash from operations 
we expect our cash resources to be adequate for at least the next twelve months 
the adequacy of our cash resources is dependent on the amount and timing of government funding as well as our ability to sell our products with adequate gross profit 
beyond the next twelve months  the adequacy of our cash resources will largely depend on our success in achieving profitable operations and positive operating cash flows on a sustained basis 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this annual report on form k are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingencies 
in preparing our financial statements in accordance with gaap  there are certain accounting policies that are particularly important 
these include revenue recognition  inventory valuation  income taxes  research and development expenses and share based compensation 
we believe these accounting policies and others set forth in note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item exhibits and financial statement schedules in part iv of this annual report should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition 
in some cases  these policies represent required accounting 
in other cases  they may represent a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation 
additionally  we consider certain judgments and estimates to be significant  including those relating to the estimated selling price determination used in revenue recognition  percentage of completion accounting  estimates of proportional performance on co funded engineering contracts and prepaid engineering services  determination of inventory at the lower of cost or market  useful lives for depreciation and amortization  determination of future cash flows associated with impairment testing of long lived assets  determination of the fair value of stock options and other assessments of fair value  calculation of deferred income tax assets  including our ability to utilize such assets  potential income tax assessments and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current conditions and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates and assumptions 
our management has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of judgments and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when we have persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
delivery does not occur until the products have been shipped or services provided to the customer  risk of loss has transferred to the customer  and  where applicable  a customer acceptance has been obtained 
the sales price is not considered to be fixed or determinable until all material contingencies related to the sales have been resolved 
we record revenue in the consolidated statements of operations net of any sales  use  value added or certain excise taxes imposed by governmental authorities on specific sales transactions 
in addition to the aforementioned general policy  the following are our statements of policy with regard to multiple element arrangements and specific revenue recognition policies for each major category of revenue 
multiple element arrangements 
we commonly enter into revenue arrangements that include multiple deliverables of our product and service offerings due to the needs of our customers 
product may be delivered in phases over time periods which can be as long as five years 
maintenance services generally begin upon acceptance of the first equipment delivery and future deliveries of equipment generally have an associated maintenance period 
we consider the maintenance period to commence upon acceptance of the product or installation in situations where a formal acceptance is not required  which may include a warranty period and accordingly allocate a portion of the arrangement consideration as a separate deliverable which is recognized as service revenue over the entire service period 
other services such as training and engineering services can be delivered as a discrete delivery or over the term of the contract 
a multiple element arrangement is separated into more than one unit of accounting if the following criteria are met the delivered item s has value to the customer on a standalone basis  and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item s  delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in our control 

table of contents if these criteria are not met  the arrangement is accounted for as one unit of accounting which would result in revenue being recognized ratably over the contract term or being deferred until the earlier of when such criteria are met or when the last undelivered element is delivered 
if these criteria are met for each element  the arrangement consideration is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on each unit s relative estimated selling price 
we follow a selling price hierarchy in determining the best estimate of the selling price of each deliverable 
certain products and services are sold separately in standalone arrangements for which we are sometimes able to determine vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe 
we determine vsoe based on normal pricing and discounting practices for the product or service when sold separately 
when we are not able to establish vsoe for all deliverables in an arrangement with multiple elements  we attempt to establish the selling price of each remaining element based on third party evidence  or tpe 
our inability to establish vsoe is often due to a relatively small sample of customer contracts that differ in system size and contract terms which can be due to infrequently selling each element separately  not pricing products within a narrow range  or only having a limited sales history  such as in the case of certain advanced and emerging technologies 
tpe is determined based on our prices or competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately 
however  we are often unable to determine tpe  as our offerings contain a significant level of customization and differentiation from those of competitors and we are often unable to reliably determine what similar competitor products selling prices are on a standalone basis 
when we are unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe  we use estimated selling price  or esp  in our allocation of arrangement consideration 
the objective of esp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis 
in determining esp  we use either the list price of the deliverable less a discount or the cost to provide the product or service plus a margin 
when using list price less a discount  we use discounts from list price for previous transactions 
this approach incorporates several factors  including the size of the transaction and any changes to list prices 
the data is collected from prior sales  and although the data may not have the sample size or consistency to establish vsoe  it is sufficiently objective to estimate the selling price 
when using cost plus a margin  we consider the total cost of the product or service  including customer specific and geographic factors 
we also consider the historical margins of the product or service on previous contracts and several factors including any changes to pricing methodologies  competitiveness of products and services and cost drivers that would cause future margins to differ from historical margins 
products 
we most often recognize revenue from sales of products upon customer acceptance of the system 
where formal acceptance is not required  we recognize revenue upon delivery or installation 
when the product is part of a multiple element arrangement  we allocate a portion of the arrangement consideration to product revenue based on estimates of selling price 
services 
maintenance services are provided under separate maintenance contracts with customers 
these contracts generally provide for maintenance services for one year  although some are for multi year periods  often with prepayments for the term of the contract 
we consider the maintenance period to commence upon acceptance of the product or installation in situations where a formal acceptance is not required  which may include a warranty period 
when service is part of a multiple element arrangement  we allocate a portion of the arrangement consideration to maintenance service revenue based on estimates of selling price 
maintenance contracts that are billed in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue 
maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract 
revenue from engineering services is recognized as services are performed 

table of contents project revenue 
revenue from design and build contracts is recognized under the percentage of completion  or poc method 
under the poc method  revenue is recognized based on the costs incurred to date as a percentage of the total estimated costs to fulfill the contract 
if circumstances arise that change the original estimates of revenues  costs  or extent of progress toward completion  revisions to the estimates are made 
these revisions may result in increases or decreases in estimated revenues or costs  and such revisions are recorded in income in the period in which the circumstances that gave rise to the revision become known by management 
we perform ongoing profitability analyses of our contracts accounted for under the poc method in order to determine whether the latest estimates of revenue  costs and extent of progress require updating 
if at any time these estimates indicate that the contract will be unprofitable  the entire estimated loss for the remainder of the contract is recorded immediately 
we record revenue from certain research and development contracts which include milestones using the milestone method if the milestones are determined to be substantive 
a milestone is considered to be substantive if management believes there is substantive uncertainty that it will be achieved and the milestone consideration meets all of the following criteria it is commensurate with either of the following our performance to achieve the milestone  or the enhancement of value of the delivered item or items as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone 
it relates solely to past performance 
it is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms including other potential milestone consideration within the arrangement 
the individual milestones are determined to be substantive or nonsubstantive in their entirety and milestone consideration is not bifurcated 
revenue from projects is classified as product revenue or service revenue  based on the nature of the work performed 
nonmonetary transactions 
we value and record nonmonetary transactions at the fair value of the asset surrendered unless the fair value of the asset received is more clearly evident  in which case the fair value of the asset received is used 
inventory valuation we record our inventory at the lower of cost or market 
we regularly evaluate the technological usefulness and anticipated future demand for our inventory components 
due to rapid changes in technology and the increasing demands of our customers  we are continually developing new products 
additionally  during periods of product or inventory component upgrades or transitions  we may acquire significant quantities of inventory to support estimated current and future production and service requirements 
as a result  it is possible that older inventory items we have purchased may become obsolete  be sold below cost or be deemed in excess of quantities required for production or service requirements 
when we determine it is not likely we will recover the cost of inventory items through future sales  we write down the related inventory to our estimate of its market value 
because the products we sell have high average sales prices and because a high number of our prospective customers receive funding from us or foreign governments  it is difficult to estimate future sales of our products and the timing of such sales 
it also is difficult to determine whether the cost of our inventories will ultimately be recovered through future sales 
while we believe our inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market and that our estimates and assumptions to determine any adjustments to the cost of our inventories are reasonable  our estimates may prove to be inaccurate 
we have sold inventory previously reduced in part or in whole to zero  and we may have future sales of previously written down inventory 
we also may have additional expense to write down inventory to its estimated market value 
adjustments to these estimates in the future may materially impact our operating results 

table of contents accounting for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is provided when we estimate that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized through future operations 
this assessment is based upon consideration of available positive and negative evidence  which includes  among other things  our recent results of operations and expected future profitability 
we consider our actual historical results over several years to have stronger weight than other more subjective indicators  including forecasts  when considering whether to establish or reduce a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
cray has significant difficulty projecting future results due to the nature of the business and the industry in which the company operates 
we recognize the income tax benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the applicable taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of our position 
the tax benefit recognized in the financial statements from such a position is measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
estimated interest and penalties are recorded as a component of interest expense and other expense  respectively 
as of december   we had approximately million of net deferred tax assets  against which we provided a million valuation allowance  resulting in a net deferred tax asset of million 
in  the company reduced the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets established in prior years 
the aggregate reduction of million 
per diluted share in deferred tax valuation allowances was attributable to a million reduction related to a portion of the company s us deferred tax assets and million reduction related to all of the deferred tax assets of our german subsidiary 
the reductions in previously established allowances were based upon an evaluation of all available positive and negative evidence including an assessment of known business risks and industry trends  as well as forecasted domestic and international earnings 
we continue to provide a partial valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets and a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets arising in a limited number of foreign jurisdictions as the realization of such assets is not considered to be more likely than not at this time 
in a future period the company s assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets and therefore the appropriateness of the valuation allowance could change based on an assessment of all available evidence  both positive and negative in that future period 
if our conclusion about the realizability of our deferred tax assets and therefore the appropriateness of the valuation allowance changes in a future period we could record a substantial tax provision or benefit in our consolidated statement of operations when that occurs 
research and development expenses research and development expenses include costs incurred in the development and production of our hardware and software  costs incurred to enhance and support existing product features  costs incurred to support and improve our development processes  and costs related to future product development 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred  and may be offset by co funding from third parties 
we may also enter into arrangements whereby we make advance  non refundable payments to a vendor to perform certain research and development services 
these payments are deferred and recognized over the vendor s estimated performance period 
amounts to be received under co funding arrangements with the us government or other customers are based on either contractual milestones or costs incurred 
these co funding milestone payments are recognized in operations as performance is estimated to be completed and are measured as milestone achievements occur or as costs are incurred 
these estimates are reviewed on a periodic basis and are subject to change  including in the near term 
if an estimate is changed  net research and development expense could be impacted significantly 

table of contents we do not record a receivable from the us government prior to completing the requirements necessary to bill for a milestone or cost reimbursement 
funding from the us government is subject to certain budget restrictions and milestones may be subject to completion risk  and as a result  there may be periods in which research and development costs are expensed as incurred for which no reimbursement is recorded  as milestones have not been completed or the us government has not funded an agreement 
accordingly  there can be substantial variability in the amount of net research and development expenses from quarter to quarter and year to year 
we classify amounts to be received from funded research and development projects as either revenue or a reduction to research and development expense based on the specific facts and circumstances of the contractual arrangement  considering total costs expected to be incurred compared to total expected funding and the nature of the research and development contractual arrangement 
in the event that a particular arrangement is determined to represent revenue  the corresponding research and development costs are classified as cost of revenue 
share based compensation we measure compensation cost for share based payment awards at fair value and recognize it as compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest 
we recognize share based compensation expense for all share based payment awards  net of an estimated forfeiture rate 
we recognize compensation cost for only those shares expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards requires subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
we utilize the black scholes options pricing model to value the stock options granted under our options plans 
in this model  we utilize assumptions related to stock price volatility  stock option term and forfeiture rates that are based upon both historical factors as well as management s judgment 
the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares or units granted and the quoted price of our common stock at the date of grant 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update asu no 
 comprehensive income  or asu the guidance in asu revises the manner in which entities present comprehensive income in their financial statements 
an entity is required to report the components of comprehensive income in either one or two consecutive financial statements a single  continuous statement must present the components of net income and total net income  the components of other comprehensive income and total other comprehensive income  and a total for comprehensive income 
in a two statement approach  an entity must present the components of net income and total net income in the first statement 
that statement must be immediately followed by a financial statement that presents the components of other comprehensive income  a total for other comprehensive income  and a total for comprehensive income 
asu does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income 
the amendments in asu are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not believe the adoption of asu will have a material impact on the presentation of information in its financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and equity price fluctuations 

table of contents interest rate risk we invest our available cash in money market mutual funds whose underlying investments include investment grade debt instruments of corporate issuers and in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies 
we do not have any derivative instruments or auction rate securities in our investment portfolio 
we protect and preserve invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
although we have the above noted risks  a change in interest rates would not be material 
foreign currency risk we sell our products primarily in north america  asia and europe 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
our products are generally priced based on us dollars  and a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
while we often sell products with payments in us dollars  our product sales contracts may call for payment in foreign currencies and to the extent we do so  or engage with our foreign subsidiaries in transactions deemed to be short term in nature  we are subject to foreign currency exchange risks 
as of december   we had entered into forward exchange contracts that hedge approximately million of anticipated cash receipts on specific foreign currency denominated sales contracts 
these forward contracts hedge the risk of foreign exchange rate changes between the time that the related contracts were signed and when the cash receipts are expected to be received 
our foreign maintenance contracts are typically paid in local currencies and provide a partial natural hedge against foreign exchange exposure 
to the extent that we wish to repatriate any of these funds to the united states  however  we are subject to foreign exchange risks 
as of december   a change in foreign exchange rates could impact our annual earnings and cash flows by approximately million 
we do not hold or purchase any currency forward exchange contracts for trading purposes
