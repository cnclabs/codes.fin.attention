and subsidiary management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides an assessment of the company s financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  and capital resources and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes 
overview the company manufactures and distributes a full line of snack items  such as potato chips  tortilla chips  corn chips  fried pork skins  baked and fried cheese curls  onion rings  and puff corn 
the products are all packaged in flexible bags or other suitable wrapping material 
the company also sells canned dips  pretzels  peanut butter crackers  cheese crackers  dried meat products  and nuts packaged by other manufacturers using the golden flake label 
no single product or product line accounts for more than of the company s sales  which affords some protection against loss of volume due to a crop failure of major agricultural raw materials or failure to procure an adequate supply of pork skin pellets 
raw materials used in manufacturing and processing the company s snack food products are purchased on the open market  under contract through brokers and directly from growers 
a large part of the raw materials used by the company consists of farm commodities which are subject to precipitous changes in supply and price 
weather varies from season to season and directly affects both the quality and supply of farm commodities available 
the company has no control of the agricultural aspects and its profits are affected accordingly 
the company sells its products through its own sales organization to commercial establishments that sell food products primarily in the southeastern united states and independent distributors 
the products are distributed through the independent distributors and route representatives who are supplied with selling inventory by the company s trucking fleet 
all of the route representatives are employees of the company and use the company s direct store delivery system 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  the preparation of which in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due considerations to materiality 
the company does not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions related to the accounting policies described below 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
other accounting policies and estimates are detailed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this k

accounts receivable the company records accounts receivable at the time revenue is recognized 
amounts for bad debt expense are recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations 
the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management s estimate of the accounts receivable amount that is uncollectible 
the company records a general reserve based on analysis of historical data 
in addition  the company records specific reserves for receivable balances that are considered high risk due to known facts regarding the customer 
the allowance for bad debts is reviewed quarterly  and determined whether the amount should be changed

the company is self insured for certain casualty losses relating to automobile liability  general liability  workers compensation  property losses  and medical claims 
the company also has stop loss insurance coverage to limit the exposure arising from these claims 
automobile liability  general liability  workers compensation  and property losses costs are covered by letters of credit with the company s claim administrators 
the company uses a third party actuary to estimate the casualty insurance obligations on an annual basis 
in determining the ultimate loss and reserve requirements  the third party actuary uses various actuarial assumptions including compensation trends  health care cost trends  and discount rates 
the third party actuary also uses historical information for claims frequency and severity in order to establish loss development factors 
the actuarial calculation includes a factor to account for changes in inflation  health care costs  compensation and litigation cost trends  as well as estimated future incurred claims 
this year  the company utilized a confidence level for estimating the ultimate outstanding casualty liability based on the actuarial report 
this assumes that approximately of each claim should be equal to or less than the ultimate liability recorded based on the historical trends experienced by the company 
if the company chose a factor  the liability would have been increased by approximately million 
if the company chose a factor  the liability would have increased by approximately million 
this year the company used a investment rate to discount the estimated claims based on the historical payout pattern during and a one percentage point change in the discount rate would have impacted the liability by approximately  actual ultimate losses could vary from those estimated by the third party actuary 
the company believes the reserves established are reasonable estimates of the ultimate liability based on historical trends 
as of june   the company s casualty reserve was  and at june  the casualty reserve was  employee medical insurance accruals are recorded based on medical claims processed as well as historical medical claims experienced for claims incurred but not yet reported 
differences in estimates and assumptions could result in an accrual requirement materially different from the calculated accrual

the company is subject to market risk with respect to commodities because its ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which it operates 
the company purchases its raw materials on the open market  under contract through brokers and directly from growers 
futures contracts have been used occasionally to hedge immaterial amounts of commodity purchases  but none are presently being used 
inflation certain costs and expenses of the company are affected by inflation

environmental matters golden flake s waste water treatment plant is an environmentally friendly way to dispose of process water at the birmingham plant 
the treatment plant has allowed golden flake to release the processing water into a neighboring creek which has improved the flow of water in the creek and has positively impacted the environment in the area surrounding the plant 
the treatment plant has also helped to reduce expenses associated with sewer charges since this has replaced the previous system which disposed of the process water through the public sewer system
