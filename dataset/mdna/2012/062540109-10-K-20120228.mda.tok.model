critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and follow general practices within the industries in which we operate 
the most significant accounting policies we follow are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
application of these principles requires us to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
most accounting policies are not considered by management to be critical accounting policies 
several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy is critical in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
these factors include among other things  whether the policy requires management to make difficult  subjective  and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the accounting policies which we believe to be most critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements are those that are related to the determination of the reserve for credit losses  fair value estimates  leased asset residual values  mortgage servicing rights  pension and postretirement benefit obligations  and income taxes 
reserve for credit losses a consequence of lending activities is that we may incur credit losses 
the amount of such losses will vary depending upon the risk characteristics of the loan and lease portfolio as affected by economic conditions such as rising interest rates and the financial performance of borrowers 
the reserve for credit losses consists of the allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance and a reserve for unfunded commitments the unfunded reserve 
the reserve for credit losses provides for credit losses inherent in lending or commitments to lend and is based on loss estimates derived from a comprehensive quarterly evaluation  reflecting analyses of individual borrowers and historical loss experience  supplemented as necessary by credit judgment to 
table of contents address observed changes in trends  conditions  and other relevant environmental and economic factors 
the allowance provides for probable and estimable losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio 
the allowance is increased or decreased through the provisioning process 
there is no exact method of predicting specific losses or amounts that ultimately may be charged off on particular segments of the loan and lease portfolio 
management s evaluation of the adequacy of the reserve for credit losses is often the most critical of accounting estimates for a banking institution 
our determination of the amount of the reserve for credit losses is a critical accounting estimate as it requires the use of estimates and significant judgment as to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated loss rates on homogenous portfolios  and consideration of economic factors and trends 
on a quarterly basis  an evaluation of specific individual commercial borrowers is performed to identify impaired loans 
see note to the consolidated financial statements and the corporate risk profile credit risk section in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a for more information on the allowance and the reserve for credit losses  respectively 
fair value measurements fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for an asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
the degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market inputs 
for financial instruments that are traded actively and have quoted market prices or observable market inputs  there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value 
however  when quoted market prices or observable market inputs are not fully available  significant management judgment may be necessary to estimate fair value 
in developing our fair value measurements  we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
the fair value hierarchy defines level and valuations as those that are based on quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets and quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  and model based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market 
level valuations are based on model based techniques that use at least one significant assumption not observable in the market 
these unobservable assumptions reflect estimates of assumptions that we believe market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
financial assets that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis include available for sale investment securities  mortgage servicing rights  investments related to deferred compensation arrangements  and derivative assets and liabilities 
as of december  and  billion or and billion or  respectively  of our total assets consisted of financial assets recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and most of these financial assets consisted of available for sale investment securities measured using information from a third party pricing service 
these investments in debt securities and mortgage backed securities were all classified in either levels or of the fair value hierarchy 
as of december  and  level financial assets recorded at fair value on a recurring basis were million and million  respectively  or less than of our total assets  and was comprised of mortgage servicing rights and derivative assets and liabilities 
our third party pricing service makes no representations or warranties that the pricing data provided to us is complete or free from errors  omissions  or defects 
as a result  we have processes in place to monitor and periodically review the information provided to us by our third party pricing service such as our third party pricing service provides us with documentation by asset class of inputs and methodologies used to value securities 
we review this documentation to evaluate the inputs and valuation methodologies used to place securities into the appropriate level of the fair value hierarchy 
this documentation is periodically updated by our third party pricing service 
accordingly  transfers of securities within the fair value hierarchy are made if deemed necessary 
on a quarterly basis  management reviews the pricing information received from our third party pricing service 
this review process includes a comparison to non binding third party broker quotes  as well as a review of market related conditions impacting the information provided by our third party pricing service 
we also identify investment securities which may have traded in illiquid or inactive markets by identifying instances of a significant decrease in the volume or frequency of 
table of contents trades relative to historic levels  as well as instances of a significant widening of the bid ask spread in the brokered markets 
as of december  and  management did not make adjustments to prices provided by our third party pricing service as a result of illiquid or inactive markets 
on a quarterly basis  management also reviews a sample of securities priced by the company s third party pricing service to review significant assumptions and valuation methodologies used 
based on this review  management determines whether the current placement of the security in the fair value hierarchy is appropriate or whether transfers may be warranted 
on an annual basis  to the extent available  we obtain and review independent auditor s reports from our third party pricing service related to controls placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness 
we did not note any significant control deficiencies in our review of the independent auditor s reports related to services rendered by our third party pricing service 
our third party pricing service has also established processes for us to submit inquiries regarding quoted prices 
periodically  we will challenge the quoted prices provided by our third party pricing service 
our third party pricing service will review the inputs to the evaluation in light of the new market data presented by us 
our third party pricing service may then affirm the original quoted price or may update the evaluation on a going forward basis 
based on the composition of our investment securities portfolio  we believe that we have developed appropriate internal controls and performed appropriate due diligence procedures to prevent or detect material misstatements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our fair value measurements 
leased asset residual values lease financing receivables include a residual value component  which represents the estimated value of leased assets upon lease expiration 
our determination of residual value is derived from a variety of sources  including equipment valuation services  appraisals  and publicly available market data on recent sales transactions on similar equipment 
the length of time until lease termination  the cyclical nature of equipment values  and the limited marketplace for re sale of certain leased assets  are important variables considered in making this determination 
we update our valuation analysis on an annual basis  or more frequently as warranted by events or circumstances 
when we determine that the fair value is lower than the expected residual value at lease expiration  the difference is recognized as an asset impairment in the period in which the analysis is completed 
mortgage servicing rights when mortgage loans are sold with servicing rights retained  a servicing asset is established and accounted for based on estimated fair values 
an estimated fair value is used because there is no quoted or established market for mortgage servicing rights 
the estimated fair value is determined using discounted cash flow modeling techniques  which requires us to make estimates and assumptions regarding the amount and timing of expected future cash flows  loan repayment rates  costs to service  and interest rates that reflect the risks involved 
our estimates of the fair value of mortgage servicing rights are sensitive to changes in the underlying estimates and assumptions 
had we assumed lower interest rates and higher loan repayment rates  the estimated fair value of our mortgage servicing rights may have been lower than recorded in our consolidated statements of condition 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for key assumptions used by management as well as a sensitivity analysis of changes in certain key assumptions 
pension and postretirement benefit obligations our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost are actuarially determined based on a number of key assumptions  including the discount rate  estimated future return on plan assets  and the health care cost trend rate 
our determination of the pension and postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost is a critical accounting estimate as it requires the use of estimates and judgment related to the amount and timing of expected future cash out flows for benefit payments and cash in flows for maturities and return on plan assets 
changes in estimates and assumptions related to mortality rates and future health care costs could also have a material impact to our financial condition or results of operations 
a discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit cost 
the discount rate used to value the present value of future benefit obligations as of each year end is the rate used to determine the net periodic benefit cost for the following year

income taxes we determine our liabilities for income taxes based on current tax regulation and interpretations in tax jurisdictions where our income is subject to taxation 
currently  we file tax returns in nine federal  state and local domestic jurisdictions  and four foreign jurisdictions 
in estimating income taxes payable or receivable  we assess the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment considering statutory  judicial  and regulatory guidance in the context of each tax position 
accordingly  previously estimated liabilities are regularly reevaluated and adjusted  through the provision for income taxes 
changes in the estimate of income taxes payable or receivable occur periodically due to changes in tax rates  interpretations of tax law  the status of examinations being conducted by various taxing authorities  and newly enacted statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance that impact the relative merits and risks of each tax position 
these changes  when they occur  may affect the provision for income taxes as well as current and deferred income taxes  and may be significant to our statements of income and condition 
management s determination of the realization of net deferred tax assets is based upon management s judgment of various future events and uncertainties  including the timing and amount of future income  as well as the implementation of various tax planning strategies to maximize realization of the deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
as of december  and  we carried a valuation allowance of million and million  respectively  related to our deferred tax assets established in connection with our low income housing investments 
we are required to record a liability  referred to as an unrecognized tax benefit utb  for the entire amount of benefit taken in a prior or future income tax return when we determine that a tax position has a less than likelihood of being accepted by the taxing authority 
as of december  and  our liabilities for utbs were million and million  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on income taxes

we have evaluated these loans for impairment and have recorded partial charge offs totaling million on two of these loans 
commercial mortgage non accrual loans decreased by million from december  to million as of december  as of december   the balance consists of three borrowers 
we have evaluated these loans for impairment and have recorded a partial charge off of million on one of the loans 
construction non accrual loans increased by million from december  to million as of december  this increase was primarily due to the addition of the one million construction loan to non accrual status noted above 
residential mortgage non accrual loans decreased by million from december  to million as of december   primarily due to residential mortgage loan modifications that were restored to accrual status after the borrower demonstrated performance under the modified terms by making six consecutive payments 
as of december   our residential mortgage non accrual loans were comprised of loans with a weighted average current ltv ratio of 
foreclosed real estate represents property acquired as the result of borrower defaults on loans 
foreclosed real estate is recorded at fair value  less estimated selling costs  at the time of foreclosure 
on an ongoing basis  properties are appraised as required by market indications and applicable regulations 
foreclosed real estate increased by million from december  to million as of december  this increase was primarily due to the addition of one foreclosed commercial property on the neighbor islands 
included in npas are loans that we consider impaired 
impaired loans are defined as those which we believe it is probable we will not collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement  as well as those loans whose terms have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring tdr 
impaired loans were million as of december   compared to million as of december  impaired loans had a related allowance of million as of december  and million as of december  as of december   we have recorded charge offs of million related to our impaired loans 
loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring table presents information on loans whose terms have been modified in a tdr 
loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring table dollars in thousands restructured loans on accrual status and not past due days or more restructured loans included in non accrual loans or accruing loans past due days or more total restructured loans we had loans whose terms had been modified in a tdr of million as of december   compared to million as of december  
table of contents this increase was primarily due to a million increase in modified residential mortgage loans 
residential mortgage loans modified in a tdr were primarily comprised of loans where we lowered monthly payments to accommodate the borrowers financial needs for a period of time 
loans and leases past due days or more and still accruing interest loans and leases that are days or more past due  as to principal or interest  and still accruing interest are in this category because they are well secured and in the process of collection 
loans and leases past due days or more and still accruing interest were million as of december   an increase of million from december  this increase was primarily in our residential mortgage and home equity portfolios 
if interest due on the balances of all non accrual loans as of december  had been accrued under the original terms  approximately million in total interest income would have been recorded in  compared to the million recorded as interest income on those loans

table of contents based on our ongoing assessment of credit quality of the loan and lease portfolio and the economic environment  our allowance was million as of december  and million as of december  the ratio of the allowance to total loans and leases outstanding was as of december  compared to as of december  the decrease in the ratio of the allowance to total loans and leases in was primarily due to an million reduction in the allowance in due to improvements in credit quality and a generally improving economy in hawaii 
with continued stability in the hawaii economy and continued improvements in credit quality  including reductions in our higher risk loan segments  we may require a lower level of the allowance in future periods 
net loan and lease charge offs were million or of total average loans and leases in  a decrease from million or of total average loans and leases in net loans and leases charged off decreased in all of our commercial and consumer lending portfolios during commercial net charge offs were million in  a decrease of million from this decrease was primarily in our commercial and industrial portfolio  which experienced a million decrease in net charge offs in compared to consumer net charge offs were million in  a decrease of million from this decrease was primarily in our residential mortgage and home equity portfolios 
the components of the allowance  including the allocation between commercial and consumer categories is based on an evaluation of individual credits  historical loan and lease loss experience  management s evaluation of the current loan portfolio  and current economic conditions 
the allocation of the allowance to our commercial portfolio decreased by million from december  primarily due to lower levels of charge offs across all classes of our commercial loan portfolio 
we have decreased the allocation of the allowance to all classes of our commercial portfolio  except leasing 
relative to our total loan and lease portfolio  our domestic air transportation leases continue to demonstrate a higher risk profile as evidenced by recent airlines bankruptcies and continued high fuel prices 
the allocation of the allowance to our consumer portfolio decreased by million from december  primarily due to lower levels of charge offs across all classes of our consumer loan portfolio 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the allowance and credit quality indicators 
reserve for unfunded commitments the unfunded reserve was million as of december   unchanged from december  the process used to determine the unfunded reserve is consistent with the process for determining the allowance  as adjusted for estimated funding probabilities or loan and lease equivalency factors 
risks related to representation and warranty provisions we sell residential mortgage loans in the secondary market primarily to fannie mae 
we also pool federal housing administration fha insured and us department of veterans affairs va guaranteed residential mortgage loans for sale to ginnie mae 
these pools of fha insured and va guaranteed residential mortgage loans are securitized by ginnie mae 
the agreements under which we sell residential mortgage loans to fannie mae or ginnie mae and the insurance or guaranty agreements with fha and va contain provisions that include various representations and warranties regarding the origination and characteristics of the residential mortgage loans 
although the specific representations and warranties vary among investors  insurance or guarantee agreements  they typically cover ownership of the loan  validity of the lien securing the loan  the absence of delinquent taxes or liens against the property securing the loan  compliance with loan criteria set forth in the applicable agreement  compliance with applicable federal  state  and local laws  and other matters 
as of december   the unpaid principal balance of our portfolio of residential mortgage loans sold was billion 
these loans are generally sold on a non recourse basis 
the agreements under which we sell residential mortgage loans require us to deliver various documents to the investor or its document custodian 
although these loans are primarily sold on a non recourse basis  we may be obligated to repurchase residential mortgage loans where required documents are not delivered or are defective 
investors may require the immediate repurchase of a mortgage loan when an early payment default underwriting review reveals significant underwriting deficiencies  even if the mortgage loan has subsequently been brought current 
upon receipt of a repurchase request  we work with investors or insurers to arrive at a mutually agreeable 
table of contents resolution 
repurchase demands are typically reviewed on an individual loan by loan basis to validate the claims made by the investor or insurer and to determine if a contractually required repurchase event has occurred 
we manage the risk associated with potential repurchases or other forms of settlement through our underwriting and quality assurance practices and by servicing mortgage loans to meet investor and secondary market standards 
for the year ended december   we repurchased residential mortgage loans with an unpaid principal balance of million as a result of the representation and warranty provisions contained in these contracts 
of these repurchased loans  were current as to principal and interest at the time of repurchase 
for the year ended december   no losses were incurred related to these repurchases 
as of december   there was one pending repurchase request related to representation and warranty provisions with an unpaid principal balance of less than million 
risks relating to residential mortgage loan servicing activities in addition to servicing loans in our portfolio  substantially all of the loans we sell to investors are sold with servicing rights retained 
the loans we service were originated by us or by other mortgage loan originators 
as servicer  our primary duties are to collect payments due from borrowers  advance certain delinquent payments of principal and interest  maintain and administer any hazard  title  or primary mortgage insurance policies relating to the mortgage loans  maintain any required escrow accounts for payment of taxes and insurance and administer escrow payments  and foreclose on defaulted mortgage loans or  to the extent consistent with the documents governing a securitization  consider alternatives to foreclosure  such as loan modifications or short sales 
each agreement under which we act as servicer generally specifies a standard of responsibility for actions taken by us in such capacity and provides protection against expenses and liabilities incurred by us when acting in compliance with the respective servicing agreements 
however  if we commit a material breach of our obligations as servicer  we may be subject to termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period following notice 
the standards governing servicing and the possible remedies for violations of such standards vary by investor 
these standards and remedies are determined by servicing guides issued by the investors as well as the contract provisions established between the investors and the bank 
remedies could include repurchase of an affected loan 
as of december   there was one pending repurchase request related to servicing activities with an unpaid principal balance of million 
although to date repurchase requests related to representation and warranty provisions  and servicing activities have been limited  it is possible that requests to repurchase mortgage loans may increase in frequency as investors more aggressively pursue all means of recovering losses on their purchased loans 
however  as of december   we believe that this exposure is not material due to the historical level of repurchase requests and loss trends and thus have not established a liability for losses related to mortgage loan repurchases 
as of december   of our residential mortgage loans serviced for investors were current 
we maintain ongoing communications with our investors and will continue to evaluate this exposure by monitoring the level and number of repurchase requests as well as the delinquency rates in our investor portfolios 
market risk market risk is the potential of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and prices 
we are exposed to market risk as a consequence of the normal course of conducting our business activities 
our market risk management process involves measuring  monitoring  controlling  and mitigating risks that can significantly impact our statements of income and condition 
in this management process  market risks are balanced with expected returns in an effort to enhance earnings performance  while limiting volatility 
our primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk the objective of our interest rate risk management process is to maximize net interest income while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity 
the potential cash flows  sales  or replacement value of many of our assets and liabilities  especially those that earn or pay interest  are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
this interest rate risk arises primarily from our normal business activities of gathering deposits and extending loans 

table of contents many factors affect our exposure to changes in interest rates  such as general economic and financial conditions  customer preferences  historical pricing relationships  and repricing characteristics of financial instruments 
our earnings are affected not only by general economic conditions  but also by the monetary and fiscal policies of the us and its agencies  particularly the frb 
the monetary policies of the frb can influence the overall growth of loans  investment securities  and deposits and the level of interest rates earned on assets and paid for liabilities 
the nature and impact of future changes in monetary policies are generally not predictable 
in managing interest rate risk  we  through the asset liability management committee alco  measure short and long term sensitivities to changes in interest rates 
the alco  which is comprised of members of executive management  utilizes several techniques to manage interest rate risk  which include adjusting balance sheet mix or altering the interest rate characteristics of assets and liabilities  changing product pricing strategies  modifying characteristics of the investment securities portfolio  or using derivative financial instruments 
the use of derivative financial instruments  as detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements  has generally been limited 
this is due to natural on balance sheet hedges arising out of offsetting interest rate exposures from loans and investment securities with deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
in particular  the investment securities portfolio is utilized to manage the interest rate exposure and sensitivity to within the guidelines and limits established by the alco 
we utilize natural and offsetting economic hedges in an effort to reduce the need to employ off balance sheet derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk exposures 
expected movements in interest rates are also considered in managing interest rate risk 
thus  as interest rates change  we may use different techniques to manage interest rate risk 
a key element in our ongoing process to measure and monitor interest rate risk is the utilization of an asset liability simulation model 
the model is used to estimate and measure the balance sheet sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
these estimates are based on assumptions on the behavior of loan and deposit pricing  repayment rates on mortgage based assets  and principal amortization and maturities on other financial instruments 
the model s analytics include the effects of standard prepayment options on mortgages and customer withdrawal options for deposits 
while such assumptions are inherently uncertain  we believe that these assumptions are reasonable 
as a result  the simulation model attempts to capture the dynamic nature of the balance sheet 
we utilize net interest income simulations to analyze short term income sensitivities to changes in interest rates 
table presents  for the next twelve months subsequent to december  and  an estimate of the change in net interest income that would result from a gradual and immediate change in interest rates  moving in a parallel fashion over the entire yield curve  relative to the measured base case scenario 
the base case scenario assumes the balance sheet and interest rates are generally unchanged 
based on the net interest income simulation as of december   net interest income sensitivity to changes in interest rates as of december  was generally slightly less sensitive to changes in interest rates compared to the sensitivity profile as of december  as a result of our strategy to maintain a relatively short investment portfolio duration  net interest income is expected to increase as interest rates rise 
economic conditions and government intervention continue to result in interest rates remaining relatively low 

table of contents net interest income sensitivity profile table impact on future annual net interest income dollars in thousands december  december  gradual change in interest rates basis points immediate change in interest rates basis points to analyze the impact of changes in interest rates in a more realistic manner  non parallel interest rate scenarios are also simulated 
these non parallel interest rate scenarios indicate that net interest income may decrease from the base case scenario should the yield curve flatten or become inverted for a period of time 
conversely  if the yield curve should steepen  net interest income may increase 
other market risks in addition to interest rate risk  we are exposed to other forms of market risk in our normal business transactions 
foreign currency and foreign exchange contracts expose us to a small degree of foreign currency risk 
these transactions are primarily executed on behalf of customers 
our trust and asset management income are at risk to fluctuations in the market values of underlying assets  particularly debt and equity securities 
also  our share based compensation expense is dependent on the fair value of the stock options and restricted stock at the date of grant 
the fair value of both stock options and restricted stock is impacted by the market price of the parent s common stock on the date of grant and is at risk to changes in equity markets  general economic conditions  and other factors 
liquidity risk management the objective of our liquidity risk management process is to manage cash flow and liquidity in an effort to provide continuous access to sufficient  reasonably priced funds 
funding requirements are impacted by loan originations and refinancings  deposit growth  liability issuances and settlements  and off balance sheet funding commitments 
we consider and comply with various regulatory guidelines regarding required liquidity levels and periodically monitor our liquidity position in light of the changing economic environment and customer activity 
based on periodic liquidity assessments  we may alter our asset  liability  and off balance sheet positions 
the alco monitors sources and uses of funds and modifies asset and liability positions as liquidity requirements change 
this process  combined with our ability to raise funds in money and capital markets and through private placements  provides flexibility in managing the exposure to liquidity risk 
in an effort to satisfy our liquidity needs  we actively manage our assets and liabilities 
we have immediate liquid resources in cash and noninterest bearing deposits and funds sold 
the potential sources of short term liquidity include interest bearing deposits as well as the ability to sell certain assets including available for sale investment securities 
short term liquidity is further enhanced by our ability to sell loans in the secondary market and to secure borrowings from the frb and fhlb 
short term liquidity is also generated from securities sold under agreements to repurchase  funds purchased  and short term borrowings 
deposits have historically provided us with a long term source of stable and relatively lower cost source of funding 
additional funding is available through the issuance of long term debt 
in recent years  we have retired some long term debt due to our strong liquidity position 
we continued to maintain a strong liquidity position throughout as of december   cash and cash equivalents were million  available for sale investment securities were billion  and total deposits were billion 
as of december   we continued to maintain our excess liquidity primarily in mortgage backed securities issued by ginnie mae and in us treasury notes 
as of december   our available for sale investment securities portfolio was comprised of securities with an average base duration of less than three years 

table of contents capital management in our ongoing efforts to maximize shareholder value over time  we regularly review our capital management activities including the amount of earnings we retain in excess of cash dividends paid and the amount and pace of common stock repurchases 
we also seek to maintain capital levels for the company and the bank at amounts in excess of the regulatory well capitalized thresholds by an amount commensurate with our risk profile 
periodically  we may respond to market conditions by implementing changes to our overall balance sheet positioning to manage our capital position 
the company and the bank are each subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can cause certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a material effect on our financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the company and the bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative and qualitative measures 
these measures were established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy 
as of december   the company and the bank were well capitalized under this regulatory framework 
the company s regulatory capital ratios are presented in table below 
there have been no conditions or events since december  that management believes have changed either the company s or the bank s capital classifications 
as of december   shareholders equity was billion  unchanged from december  earnings for of million  the net change in unrealized gains related to available for sale investment securities of million  and common stock issuances of million were offset by cash dividends paid of million 
in  we also repurchased million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program at an average cost per share of and a total cost of million 
from the beginning of our share repurchase program in july through december   we repurchased a total of million shares of common stock and returned a total of billion to our shareholders at an average cost of per share 
as of december   remaining buyback authority under our share repurchase program was million of the total billion repurchase amount authorized by our board of directors 
see the regulatory initiatives related to liquidity and capital section in md a for more information 
from january  through february   the parent repurchased an additional  shares of common stock at an average cost of per share for a total of million 
remaining buyback authority was million as of february  the actual amount and timing of future share repurchases  if any  will depend on market and economic conditions  regulatory rules  applicable sec rules  and various other factors 
in january  the parent s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share on the parent s outstanding shares 
the dividend will be payable on march  to shareholders of record at the close of business on february  we continue to evaluate the potential impact that regulatory proposals may have on our liquidity and capital management strategies  including basel iii and those required under the dodd frank act  as they continue to progress through the final rule making process 
see further discussion below on the potential impact that these regulatory proposals may have on our liquidity and capital requirements

regulatory initiatives related to liquidity and capital on december   the basel committee on banking supervision released the final text of the basel iii package on capital  leverage  and liquidity reforms 
under basel iii  financial institutions are required to have more capital and a higher quality of capital 
it does so by increasing the minimum regulatory capital ratios  narrowing the definition of capital  and requiring capital buffers 
basel iii also imposes a leverage ratio requirement and liquidity standards 
the new minimum capital requirements will be phased in between january and january as follows the minimum requirement for tier common equity ratio will be increased from the current to  the minimum requirement for the tier capital ratio to be considered adequately capitalized will be increased from the current to  an additional of tier common equity to total risk weighted assets to be phased in between january  and january   and a minimum tier leverage ratio of to be tested starting january  
the liquidity proposals under basel iii include a liquidity coverage ratio to become effective january   a net stable funding ratio to become effective january   and a set of monitoring tools to establish minimum reporting requirements of financial institutions to their regulatory supervisors 
the liquidity coverage ratio is intended to ensure that banks have sufficient high quality liquid assets to sustain a significant liquidity stress scenario lasting days 
the net stable funding ratio  which has a one year time horizon  is intended to promote the use of more stable sources of funding on an ongoing basis 

table of contents implementation of these new capital and liquidity requirements has created significant uncertainty with respect to the future requirements for financial institutions 
operational risk operational risk represents the risk of loss resulting from our operations  including  but not limited to  the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside the company  errors relating to transaction processing and technology  failure to adhere to compliance requirements  and the risk of cyber security attacks 
the risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards  adverse business decisions or their implementation  and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity 
the operational risk committee the orc provides oversight and assesses the most significant operational risks facing the company 
we have developed a framework that provides for a centralized operating risk management function through the orc  supplemented by business unit responsibility for managing operational risks specific to their business units 
while we believe that internal controls have been designed to minimize operational risks  there is no assurance that business disruption or operational losses will not occur 
on an ongoing basis  management reassesses operational risks  implements appropriate process changes  and invests in enhancements to its systems of internal controls 
off balance sheet arrangements  credit commitments  and contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements we hold interests in several unconsolidated variable interest entities vies 
these unconsolidated vies are primarily low income housing partnerships 
variable interests are defined as contractual ownership or other interests in an entity that change with fluctuations in an entity s net asset value 
the primary beneficiary consolidates the vie 
we have determined that the company is not the primary beneficiary of these entities 
as a result  we do not consolidate these vies 
see discussion of our accounting policy related to vies in note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents credit commitments and contractual obligations our credit commitments and contractual obligations as of december  were as follows credit commitments and contractual obligations table dollars in thousands less than one year years years after years total credit commitments unfunded commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit commercial letters of credit total credit commitments contractual obligations deposits funds purchased securities sold under agreements to repurchase long term debt  including interest banker s acceptances outstanding capital lease obligations non cancelable operating leases purchase obligations pension and postretirement benefit contributions total contractual obligations total credit commitments and contractual obligations our liability for unrecognized tax benefits utbs as of december  was million 
we are unable to reasonably estimate the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority 
as a result  our liability for utbs is not included in this disclosure 
commitments to extend credit  standby letters of credit  and commercial letters of credit do not necessarily represent future cash requirements in that these commitments often expire without being drawn upon 
our non cancelable operating leases and capital lease obligations are primarily related to branch premises  equipment  and a portion of the company s headquarters building with lease terms extending through purchase obligations arise from agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding 
our largest purchase obligation is an outsourcing agreement for technology services related to our core systems and applications 
total payments over the remaining term of this contract  through  are estimated to be million 
other contracts included in purchase obligations primarily consist of service agreements for various systems and applications supporting bank operations 
pension and postretirement benefit contributions represent the minimum expected contribution to these plans 
actual contributions may differ from these estimates
