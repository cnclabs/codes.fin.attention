general overview we are one of the largest and most diversified manufacturers and suppliers of commercial vehicle components in north america 
our products include commercial vehicle wheels  wheel end components and assemblies  truck body and chassis parts  and ductile and gray iron castings 
we market our products under some of the most recognized brand names in the industry  including accuride  gunite  imperial  and brillion 
we believe that we have number one or number two market positions in steel wheels  forged aluminum wheels  brake drums  disc wheel hubs  and metal bumpers for commercial vehicles 
we serve the leading oems and their related aftermarket channels in most major segments of the commercial vehicle market  including heavy and medium duty trucks  commercial trailers  light trucks  buses  as well as specialty and military vehicles 
our primary product lines are standard equipment used by a majority of north american heavy and medium duty truck oems  which creates a significant barrier to entry 
we believe that substantially all heavy duty truck models manufactured in north america contain one or more accuride components 
our diversified customer base includes substantially all of the leading commercial vehicle oems  such as daimler truck north america  llc  with its freightliner and western star brand trucks  paccar  with its peterbilt and kenworth brand trucks  navistar  with its international brand trucks  and volvo mack  with its volvo and mack brand trucks 
our primary commercial trailer customers include leading commercial trailer oems  such as great dane limited partnership and wabash national  inc our major light truck customer is general motors corporation 
our product portfolio is supported by strong sales  marketing and design engineering capabilities and is manufactured in strategically located  technologically advanced facilities across the united states  mexico and canada 
key economic factors on our cost structure are raw material costs and production levels 
higher production levels enable us to spread costs that are more fixed in nature over a greater number of products 
we use the commercial vehicle production levels forecasted by industry experts to help us predict our production levels along with other assumptions for aftermarket demand 
raw material costs represent the most significant component of our product cost and are driven by a combination of purchase contracts and spot market purchases as discussed in item raw materials and suppliers and elsewhere in this report 
we expect that our wheels business will incur million higher raw material costs during as compared to  which will impact profitability  while our other businesses should reflect costs per the spot market 
reverse stock split effective november   accuride corporation implemented a one for ten reverse stock split of its common stock 
unless otherwise indicated  all share amounts and per share data in this annual report on form k for the successor company have been adjusted to reflect this reverse stock split 
business outlook global market and economic conditions have been challenging with slow economic growth in most major economies expected to continue into as a result of these market conditions  the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads 
concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce  and in some cases  cease to provide credit to businesses and consumers 
these factors have lead to a decrease in 
table of contents spending by businesses and consumers alike 
continued turbulence in the us and international markets and economies and prolonged declines in business and consumer spending may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition  and the liquidity and financial condition of our customers  including our ability to refinance maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs 
the heavy and medium duty truck and commercial trailer markets and the related aftermarket are the primary drivers of our sales 
these markets are  in turn  directly influenced by conditions in the north american truck industry and generally by conditions in other industries which indirectly impact the truck industry  such as the home building industry  and by overall economic growth and consumer spending 
accordingly  the economic conditions described above led to a severe downturn in the north american truck and vehicle supply industries  which resulted in a significant decline in our sales volume and necessitated our bankruptcy filings in october  as described above in item business chapter proceedings 
although current industry forecasts predict continued improvement in commercial vehicle production in  we cannot accurately predict the commercial vehicle cycle 
accordingly  any deterioration of the economic recovery may lead to further reduced spending and deterioration in the north american truck and vehicle supply industries for the foreseeable future 
in february  we emerged from bankruptcy with reduced financial leverage and an improved capital structure  which we believe has better enabled us to operate in this economic environment 
however  we continue to be a highly leveraged company  and a delayed or failed economic recovery would likely have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
based upon the commercial vehicle industry production forecasts  we expect results from operations to improve in compared to due to increased demand for our product and improved operational efficiencies 
on march   we  along with one other united states domestic commercial vehicle steel wheel supplier  filed antidumping and countervailing duty petitions with the united states international trade commission and the united states department of commerce alleging that manufacturers of certain steel wheels in china are dumping their products in the united states and that these manufacturers have been subsidized by their government in violation of united states trade laws 
in may  the international trade commission issued a preliminary determination that there was a reasonable indication that the us steel wheel industry is materially injured or threatened with material injury by reason of imports from china of certain steel wheels  and began the final phase of its investigation  which continues 
in august  the us department of commerce issued a preliminary determination of countervailing duties on steel wheels imported from china ranging from to ad valorem  and in october  the us department of commerce issued a preliminary determination of antidumping duty margins ranging from to ad valorem 
as a result of these determinations  the us department of commerce has instructed us customs to collect a cash deposit or bond of the applicable aggregate rate 
if the department of commerce makes a final determination that dumping or subsidies are present and the international trade commission determines that the domestic industry has been injured or is threatened with injury  the department of commerce will impose duties on the covered products imported from china in order to offset the effects of the dumping and subsidies 
no assurance can be given that these determinations will be made  that duties will be imposed or as to the amount of any duties that may be imposed 
liabilities subject to compromise in accordance with applicable accounting standards  we were required to segregate and disclose all prepetition liabilities that were subject to compromise as of december  liabilities subject to compromise represented the amounts expected to be allowed  even if they were settled for lesser amounts 
unsecured liabilities of the debtors  other than those specifically approved for payment by the court  were classified as liabilities subject to compromise 
liabilities subject to compromise were adjusted for changes in estimates and settlements of prepetition obligations 
the key factors which impacted our estimates were court actions  further developments with respect to disputed claims  determinations of the secured status of certain claims  and the values of any collateral securing such claims

the increased production is a result of continued increased maintenance and replacement demand of commercial vehicles see oem production builds in the table below

we believe that cash from operations  existing cash reserves  and our abl facility will provide adequate funds for our working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and cash interest payments through and the foreseeable future 
as of december   we had million of cash plus million in availability under our abl credit facility for total liquidity of million 
in june  we had a million advance on our abl credit facility to partially finance the acquisition of the camden operations 
in september  we received million in proceeds related to the sale of fabco automotive  which excludes million of fees paid at closing 
no provision has been made for us income taxes related to undistributed earnings of our canadian foreign subsidiary that we intend to permanently reinvest in order to finance capital improvements and or expend operations either through the expansion of the current operations or the purchase of new operations 
at december   accuride canada had million of cumulative retained earnings 
the company distributes earnings for the mexican foreign subsidiary and expects to distribute earnings annually 
therefore  deferred tax liabilities in the amounts of million and million for and  respectively  have been established for the undistributed earnings of our mexican foreign subsidiary 
our ability to fund working capital needs  planned capital expenditures  scheduled debt payments  and to comply with any financial covenants under our abl credit facility  depends on our future operating performance and cash flow  which in turn  are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
operating activities net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  amounted to million 
net cash used for the period january  through february  was million while net cash provided by operating activities for the period february  through december  was million 
this net decrease in funds used was primarily a result of increased demand for our products during and stronger initiatives to improve payment terms with our key suppliers 
cash used during included approximately million in fees and other expenses related to bankruptcy  the refinancing  the conversion offer  and the sale of certain assets 

table of contents investing activities net cash used by investing activities totaled million for the year ended december   compared to cash provided of million for the period february  through december  cash used in investing activities for the period january  through february  was million 
our most significant cash outlays for investing activities were the purchases of property  plant  and equipment 
our capital expenditures in were million  which was higher than historical levels due to increased investments in aluminum wheel capacity and other equipment 
cash generated from operations and existing cash reserves funded these expenditures 
during we had cash inflows of million related to the sale of discontinued operations 
during we had cash outflows of million related to the acquisition of the camden operations 
during the period february  through december  we had cash inflows of million related to issuance of letters of credit to replace restricted cash from previously drawn letters of credit and million related to the sale of certain assets 
capital expenditures for are expected to be between million and million  which we expect to fund through our cash from operations and existing cash reserves 
due to the continued challenges facing our industry and the economy as a whole  we are managing our capital expenditures very closely in order to preserve liquidity throughout  while still maintaining our production capacity and making investments necessary to meet competitive threats and to seize upon growth opportunities 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  totaled million related to an increase in our abl credit facility to partially finance the acquisition of the camden  south carolina facility 
net cash provided by financing activities of million during the period january  through february   while net cash used for the period february  through december  was million 
during the two periods in  we received million of proceeds related to issuance of our convertible notes and exchanged our postpetition senior credit facility for the million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes and million abl credit facility  as discussed below 
during the period february  through december   we paid million in fees related to the refinancing 
bank borrowing and senior notes refinancing on july   we completed an offering of million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes and entered into the abl credit agreement the abl facility 
we used the net proceeds from the offering of the senior secured notes  million of borrowings under the abl facility and cash on hand to refinance our postpetition senior credit facility and to pay related fees and expenses the refinancing 
the abl facility in connection with the refinancing  we entered into the abl facility 
initially  the abl facility was a senior secured asset based revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to million  with the right  subject to certain conditions  to increase the availability under the facility by up to million in the aggregate for a total aggregate availability of million 
on february   we exercised this right and increased the maximum capacity under the abl facility to million 
the four year abl facility matures on july  and provides for loans and letters of credit in an aggregate amount up to the amount of the facility  subject to meeting certain borrowing base conditions  with sub limits of up to million for swingline loans and million to be available for the issuance of letters of credit 
loans under the abl facility initially bear interest at an annual rate equal to  at our option  either libor plus or base rate plus  subject to changes based on our leverage ratio as defined in the abl facility 
we must also pay a commitment fee equal to per annum to the lenders under the abl facility if utilization under the facility exceeds of the total commitments under the facility and a commitment fee equal to per annum if utilization under the facility is less than or equal to of the total commitments under the facility 
customary letter of credit fees are also payable as necessary 
the obligations under the abl facility are secured by i first priority liens on substantially all of the company s accounts receivable and inventories  subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens the abl priority collateral and ii second priority liens on substantially all of the company s owned real property and tangible and intangible assets other than the abl priority collateral  including all of the outstanding capital stock of our domestic subsidiaries  subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens the notes priority collateral 

table of contents senior secured notes also in connection the refinancing  we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes 
under the terms of the indenture governing the senior secured notes  the senior secured notes bear interest at a rate of per year  paid semi annually in february and august  and mature on august  prior to maturity we may redeem the senior secured notes on the terms set forth in the indenture governing the senior secured notes 
the senior secured notes are guaranteed by the guarantors  and the senior secured notes and the related guarantees are secured by first priority liens on the notes priority collateral and second priority liens on the abl priority collateral 
on february   we completed an exchange offer pursuant to which all our outstanding senior secured notes were exchanged for registered securities with identical terms other than terms related to registration rights to the senior secured notes issued july  restrictive debt covenants 
our credit documents the abl facility and the indenture governing the senior secured notes contain operating covenants that limit the discretion of management with respect to certain business matters 
these covenants place significant restrictions on  among other things  the ability to incur additional debt  to pay dividends  to create liens  to make certain payments and investments and to sell or otherwise dispose of assets and merge or consolidate with other entities 
in addition  the abl facility contains a financial covenant which requires us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio during any compliance period  which is anytime when the excess availability is less than or equal to the greater of million or percent of the total commitment under the abl facility 
due to the amount of our excess availability as calculated under the abl facility  the company is not currently in a compliance period and  we do not have to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio  although this is subject to change 
based on the forecasted production volumes below  we expect to be in compliance with all restrictive debt covenants through the next twelve months 
we continue  however  to operate in a challenging economic environment and our ability to maintain liquidity and comply with our debt covenants may be affected by economic or other conditions that are beyond our control and which are difficult to predict 
the production forecasts by act publications for the significant commercial vehicle markets that we serve  as of february   are as follows north american class north american classes us trailers prior convertible notes in connection with a conversion offer completed in november  we accepted all of our previously outstanding million of convertible notes for conversion and issued  shares of common stock to holders participating in the conversion of such notes the conversion offer 
asc requires the recognition of expense equal to the fair value of securities transferred in excess of the fair value of securities issuable pursuant to the original conversion terms 
related to the conversion offer  we recorded inducement expenses of million 
this charge represents the fair value of the incremental shares of common stock that were issued as a result of the conversion offer over the fair value of the shares of the common stock that the convertible note holders would have otherwise received contractually as of the date of the conversion offer 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we do not currently have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
from time to time we may enter into operating leases  letters of credit  or take or pay obligations related to the purchase of raw materials that would not be reflected in our balance sheet

d subsequent to december   future obligations for capital leases increased by million 
on february   the company entered into a capital lease agreement for the lease of equipment to be used in the production of wheel end components by our gunite business unit 
the agreement provides financing in the amount of million to gunite for certain equipment  which is expected to be installed beginning in the second quarter of in connection with the lease agreement  the company was reimbursed for payments previously made to the manufacturer of the equipment of million 
e the unconditional purchase commitments are principally take or pay obligations related to the purchase of certain materials  including natural gas  consistent with customary industry practice 
f consists primarily of estimated post retirement and pension contributions for and estimated future post retirement and pension benefit payments for the years through amounts for and thereafter are unknown at this time 
g since it is not possible to determine in which future period it might be paid  excluded above is the million uncertain tax liability recorded in accordance with asc  income taxes 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with gaap applied on a consistent basis 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses during the reporting periods 
we continually evaluate our accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
in general  management s estimates are based on historical experience  on information from third party professionals and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates made by management 
critical accounting policies and estimates are those where the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material 
we believe our critical accounting policies and estimates  as reviewed and discussed with the audit committee of 
table of contents our board of directors  include accounting for fresh start  convertible notes  impairment of long lived assets  goodwill  pensions  and income taxes 
fresh start accounting we evaluated the applicable accounting guidance regarding fresh start and determined that we qualified to report under those requirements 
in applying fresh start reporting  we applied asc  business combinations  and recorded our assets and liabilities at fair value as of february  these fresh start adjustments were finalized during the fourth quarter of aside from the assets and liabilities that already represented fair value on our consolidated balance sheet  the significant assumptions related to the valuations of our assets and liabilities that were revalued in connection with fresh start reporting are subsequently discussed 
inventory we recorded inventories at their fair value of million  which was an increase of million 
historically  our inventories were stated at the lower of cost or market on a first in  first out fifo basis 
the fair value valuation was determined based on the estimated selling price less costs to sell for finished goods and work in process  which also considered costs to completion 
raw material values were based on replacement cost 
the increase of fair value over our stated values was amortized during as a component of cost of goods sold 
supplies at emergence the successor company adopted a supplies accounting policy that requires capitalization of critical supplies that are above a threshold limit with subsequent amortization over their useful lives 
supplies purchased that are valued below the threshold limit will be immediately recognized as an expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
approximately million of supplies for our predecessor company were removed from other current assets and million were added to other non current assets  which represented the fair value of the supplies that met the requirements of the accounting policy 
property  plant and equipment we recorded property  plant and equipment which includes land  land improvements  buildings  machinery and equipment  and construction in progress at its fair value of million 
fair value was based on the highest and best use of specific properties 
specific approaches by asset class are as follows land and land improvement values were determined based on the sales comparison approach  which considers the value of the land parcels if vacant 
in the sales comparison approach  comparable land sales and listings in each property s geographic area were obtained and compared to the property being valued  focusing most heavily on recent sales of similar size  location  and zoning 
the buildings and building improvements were valued using a direct cost method whereby the replacement cost was estimated based on building class using square foot costs 
an estimate of physical deterioration as well as functional and external obsolescence was then applied to arrive at a final fair value 
machinery and equipment were valued on a continued use basis 
using the indirect method of the cost approach  the replacement cost was indexed according to the historical cost  with allowances for physical deterioration as well as functional and external obsolescence to arrive at a final fair value 
construction in progress was reported using original cost basis 
other intangible assets we recorded other intangible assets of million at their fair values 
the following is a summary of and approaches used to determine the fair value of our significant intangible assets trade names and technology were valued at million and million  respectively  which was determined using the relief from royalty method  which capitalizes the cost savings associated with owning  rather than licensing the trade names and technology 
other significant considerations include revenues applicable to the trade names and technology with a declining obsolescence factor for technology  useful life  royalty rates  income tax rates  discount rates  and the tax benefits from amortization expense 

table of contents customer relationships were valued at million using the multi period excess earnings approach  which is a form of the income approach 
this method is based on the concept that cash flows attributable to the assets are available after deducting the costs associated with the business as well as the return on assets employed in the generation of the cash flows 
significant considerations include cash flows from existing customer relationships  estimating contributory asset charges and required rates of return on tangible and intangible assets  the tax amortization benefit  and discount rates 
goodwill we recorded goodwill of million upon application of fresh start reporting 
when applying fresh start reporting  the difference between the business enterprise value and the fair value of our assets and liabilities gives rise to goodwill  which is a residual 
deferred income taxes we recorded deferred income tax assets and liabilities of million and million  respectively  for differences resulting from applying fresh start reporting 
debt we recorded our long term debt at their total fair value of million  which had two major components  as follows the senior credit facility of million 
the million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes was recorded at fair value of million and its embedded conversion option at million 
the fair values related to the convertible notes and the embedded conversion option considered several factors  such as the price of our common stock  volatility  the risk free rate  and credit spreads 
also significant are the coupon interest rate  the rate of conversion of the notes into shares of our common stock  and the term of the instrument 
pensions and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities  current and non current we recorded pensions of million and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities of million  which includes the actuarial measurement of all of our benefit plans 
these liabilities increased by million compared to the predecessor s valuations due to changes in the market value of our assets and liabilities  eliminating accumulated other comprehensive income  and revised discount rates  which declined between and basis points from the predecessor s valuations 
stockholder s equity deficiency the changes to our stockholder s equity deficiency reflect our recapitalization using million  which is the midpoint of the range of our enterprise valuations in our plan of reorganization and the application of fresh start reporting 
also included is the elimination of our predecessor common stock  treasury stock  accumulated other comprehensive loss  and accumulated deficiency 
convertible notes we bifurcated the convertible notes in regards to the valuations of the notes and the embedded conversion option 
during  we recognized mark to market valuation gains and losses related to the conversion option 
as a result of the conversion offer that resulted in issuing more shares of common stock than was contractually required  we recognized an inducement charge of million 
this charge represents the fair value of the incremental shares of common stock that were issued as a result of the conversion offer over the fair value of the shares of the common stock that the convertible note holders would have otherwise received contractually as of the date of the conversion offer 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
in performing the review of recoverability  we estimate future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and our eventual disposition 
the estimates of future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require our subjective 
table of contents judgments 
the time periods for estimating future cash flows is often lengthy  which increases the sensitivity to assumptions made 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  such as the determination of the primary asset group  the estimated life of the primary asset  and projected profitability  the estimated future cash flows projected in the evaluation of long lived assets can vary within a wide range of outcomes 
we consider the likelihood of possible outcomes in determining the best estimate of future cash flows 
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets we review goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired 
recoverability of goodwill is measured by a comparison of the carrying value to the implied fair value 
if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an impairment charge is recognized to the extent that the implied fair value exceeds its carrying value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is the residual fair value  if any  after allocating the fair value to all of the assets recognized and unrecognized and all of the liabilities 
we estimate fair value using a combination of market value approach using quoted market prices of comparable companies and an income approach using discounted cash flow projections 
the income approach uses a projection of estimated cash flows that is discounted using a weighted average cost of capital that reflects current market conditions 
the projection uses management s best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period including growth rates in sales  costs  estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and capital expenditures 
other significant estimates and assumptions include terminal value growth rates  future estimates of capital expenditures and changes in future working capital requirements 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred 
such indicators may include  among others a significant decline in our expected future cash flows  a sustained  significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization  a significant adverse change in the business climate  unanticipated competition  and slower growth rates 
any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the annual impairment test as of november   passed  and we were not required to complete step two 
we review other intangibles for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of trademarks may be impaired 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value determined by calculating a fair value based upon a discounted cash flow of an assumed royalty rate relief of royalty method  impairment of the trademark may exist resulting in a charge to earnings to the extent of impairment 
pensions and other post employment benefits we account for our defined benefit pension plans and other post employment benefit plans in accordance with asc  defined benefit plans pensions  asc  defined benefit plans other postretirement  and asc  defined benefit plans general  which require that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
as permitted by asc  we use a smoothed value of plan assets which is further described below 
asc requires that the effects of the performance of the pension plan s assets and changes in pension liability discount rates on our computation of pension income cost be amortized over future periods 
asc requires an employer to fully recognize the obligations associated with single employer defined benefit pension  retiree healthcare  and other postretirement plans in their financial statements 
the most significant element in determining our pension income cost in accordance with asc is the expected return on plan assets and discount rates 
in  we assumed that the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would be for our us plans and for our canadian plans 
the assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over five years 
this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension income cost 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred 
the net deferral of past asset gains losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and  ultimately  future pension income cost 
the expected return on plan assets is reviewed annually  and if conditions should warrant  will be revised 
if we were to lower this rate  future pension cost would increase 
for  we currently anticipate lowering our long term rate of return assumption to for our us plans and for our canadian plans 
at the end of each year  we determine the discount rates to be used to calculate the present value of each of the plan liabilities 
the discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  we look to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
at december   we determined the 
table of contents blended rate to be 
the net effect of changes in the discount rate  as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience  has been deferred  in accordance with asc for the year ended december   we recognized consolidated pretax pension cost of million compared to million in we currently expect to contribute million to our pension plans during  however  we may elect to adjust the level of contributions based on a number of factors  including performance of pension investments  changes in interest rates  and changes in workforce compensation 
for the year ended december   we recognized consolidated pre tax post employment welfare benefit cost of million compared to million in we expect to contribute million during to our post employment welfare benefit plans 
income taxes our income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid 
we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense 
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies  and results of recent operations 
in projecting future taxable income  we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and changes in accounting policies and incorporate assumptions including the amount of future state  federal and foreign pretax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide  we consider three years of cumulative operating income loss 
upon emergence from bankruptcy  the company adjusted its recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities using the valuation adjustments resulting from fresh start accounting 
we concluded at that time that we remained in a net deferred tax asset position and re evaluated the realizability of our us net deferred tax assets by assessing the likelihood of our ability to utilize them against future taxable income and availability of tax planning strategies 
we determined that a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets continued to be appropriate 
the company will continue to evaluate the likelihood of realization on a quarterly basis and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly 
changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future 
management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows  or financial position 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations 
asc provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  on the basis of the technical merits 
asc also provides guidance on measurement  de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with asc and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available 
because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available 
we believe that it is reasonably possible that an increase of up to million in unrecognized tax benefits related to state exposures may be necessary within the coming year 
in addition  we believe that it is reasonably possible that approximately million of our currently remaining unrecognized tax benefits  each of which are individually insignificant  may be recognized by the end of as a result of a lapse of the statute of limitations

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in the normal course of doing business  we are exposed to the risks associated with changes in foreign exchange rates  raw material commodity prices  and interest rates 
we use derivative instruments to manage these exposures 
the objectives for holding derivatives are to minimize the risks using the most effective methods to eliminate or reduce the impacts of these exposures 
foreign currency risk certain forecasted transactions  assets  and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk 
we monitor our foreign currency exposures to maximize the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency derivatives 
the principal currencies of exposure are the canadian dollar and mexican peso 
from time to time  we use foreign currency financial instruments to offset the impact of the variability in exchange rates on our operations  cash flows  assets and liabilities 
at december   the notional amount of open foreign exchange forward contracts was  foreign currency derivative contracts provide only limited protection against currency risks 
factors that could impact the effectiveness of our currency risk management programs include accuracy of sales estimates  volatility of currency markets and the cost and availability of derivative instruments 
the counterparty to the foreign exchange contracts is a financial institution with an investment grade credit rating 
the use of forward contracts protects our cash flows against unfavorable movements in exchange rates  to the extent of the amount under contract 
raw material commodity price risk we rely upon the supply of certain raw materials and commodities in our production processes  and we have entered into firm purchase commitments for certain metals and natural gas 
a adverse change in pricing considering production volume would be approximately million  which would be reduced through the terms of the sales  supply  and procurement contracts 
additionally  from time to time  we use commodity price swaps and futures contracts to manage the variability in certain commodity prices on our operations and cash flows 
at december   we had no open commodity price swaps or futures contracts 
interest rate risk we use long term debt as a primary source of capital
