item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we believe that we are the first company dedicated solely to developing the full spectrum of next generation access network solutions to cost effectively deliver high bandwidth services while simultaneously preserving the investment in today s networks 
our next generation solutions are based upon our slms architecture 
from its inception  this slms architecture was specifically designed for the delivery of multiple classes of subscriber services such as voice  data and video distribution  rather than being based on a particular protocol or media 
in other words  our slms products are built to support the migration from legacy circuit to packet technologies and from copper to fiber technologies 
this flexibility and versatility allows our products to adapt to future technologies while allowing service providers to focus on the delivery of additional high bandwidth services 
because this slms architecture is designed to interoperate with existing legacy equipment  service providers can leverage their existing networks to deliver a combination of voice  data and video services today  while they migrate  either simultaneously or at a future date  from legacy equipment to next generation equipment with minimal interruption 
we believe that our slms solution provides an evolutionary path for service providers from their existing infrastructures  as well as gives newer service providers the capability to deploy cost effective  multi service networks that can support voice  data and video 
our global customer base includes regional  national and international telecommunications carriers 
to date  our products are deployed by over network service providers on six continents worldwide 
we believe that we have assembled the employee base  technological breadth and market presence to provide a simple yet comprehensive set of next generation solutions to the bandwidth bottleneck in the access network and the other problems encountered by network service providers when delivering communications services to subscribers 
since inception  we have incurred significant operating losses and had an accumulated deficit of  million as of december   and we expect that our operating losses and negative cash flows from operations may continue 
if we are unable to access or raise the capital needed to meet liquidity needs and finance capital expenditures and working capital  or if the economic  market and geopolitical conditions in the united states and the rest of the world do not improve or deteriorate  we may experience material adverse impacts on our business  operating results and financial condition 
during  we implemented several activities intended to reduce costs  improve operating efficiencies and change our operations to more closely align them with our key strategic focus  which included headcount reductions 
during the past two years  we have continued our focus on cost control and operating efficiency along with restrictions on discretionary spending 
the most significant cost cutting measure during was the sale in september of our land and buildings located in oakland  california and extinguishment of related debt in a sale and leaseback transaction with lba realty  llc  or lba realty 
the sale and leaseback transaction allowed us to reduce occupancy costs and improved our financial position by eliminating the related debt which was due in april going forward  our key financial objectives include the following increasing revenue while continuing to carefully control costs  continued investments in strategic research and product development activities that will provide the maximum potential return on investment  and minimizing consumption of our cash and short term investments 
sale of legacy inventory and other assets in december  we sold inventory and certain assets related to our access node legacy product line to a third party 
the sale of the access node product line was not treated as a discontinued operation since it did not represent a component of our company that had operations and cash flows that were clearly distinguishable  operationally and for financial reporting purposes  from the rest of the entity 
upon sale of the access node 
table of contents inventory  we recognized a gain of million in that was recorded in cost of revenue 
in   and  we recognized additional gains of million  million  and million  respectively  which were recorded in cost of revenue 
we will continue to record additional gain in the future contingent upon attainment of certain earnout provisions 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical because changes in such estimates can materially affect the amount of our reported net income or loss 
for all of these policies  management cautions that actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete 
we recognize product revenue upon shipment of product under contractual terms which transfer title to customers upon shipment  under normal credit terms  net of estimated sales returns and allowances at the time of shipment 
revenue is deferred if there are significant post delivery obligations or if the fees are not fixed or determinable 
when significant post delivery obligations exist  revenue is deferred until such obligations are fulfilled 
our arrangements generally do not have any significant post delivery obligations 
if our arrangements include customer acceptance provisions  revenue is recognized upon obtaining the signed acceptance certificate from the customer  unless we can objectively demonstrate that the delivered products or services meet all the acceptance criteria specified in the arrangement prior to obtaining the signed acceptance 
in those instances where revenue is recognized prior to obtaining the signed acceptance certificate  we use successful completion of customer testing as the basis to objectively demonstrate that the delivered products or services meet all the acceptance criteria specified in the arrangement 
we also consider historical acceptance experience with the customer  as well as the payment terms specified in the arrangement  when revenue is recognized prior to obtaining the signed acceptance certificate 
when collectability is not reasonably assured  revenue is recognized when cash is collected 
we make certain sales to product distributors 
these customers are given certain privileges to return a portion of inventory 
return privileges generally allow distributors to return inventory based on a percent of purchases made within a specific period of time 
we recognize revenue on sales to distributors that have contractual return rights when the products have been sold by the distributors  unless there is sufficient customer specific sales and sales returns history to support revenue recognition upon shipment 
in those instances when revenue is recognized upon shipment to distributors  we use historical rates of return from the distributors to provide for estimated product returns 
we accrue for warranty costs  sales returns and other allowances at the time of shipment based on historical experience and expected future costs 
in october  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  amended the accounting standards for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements to i provide updated guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the deliverables in an arrangement should be separated  and how the consideration should be allocated  ii require an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using a best estimate of selling prices  or bsp  for deliverables if a vendor does not have vendor specific objective evidence of selling price  or vsoe  or third party evidence of selling price  or tpe  and iii eliminate the use of the residual method and require an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method 

table of contents we adopted the updated accounting standards on january  on a prospective basis for applicable transactions originating or materially modified after december  this guidance does not change the units of accounting for revenue transactions 
our products and services qualify as separate units of accounting and are deemed to be non contingent deliverables as our arrangements typically do not have any significant performance  cancellation  termination and refund type provisions 
products are typically considered delivered upon shipment 
revenue from services is recognized ratably over the period during which the services are to be performed 
prior to the adoption of accounting standards update  or asu   revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  we established the fair value or tpe of services in multiple element arrangements based primarily on sales prices when the products and services were sold separately 
as such  we applied the residual method to allocate the arrangement fee between products and services 
in limited circumstances  if fair value could not be established for undelivered elements  all of the revenue under the arrangement was deferred until those elements were delivered 
upon adoption of asu  on january   we allocated revenue to products and services in such arrangements using the relative selling price method to recognize revenue when the basic revenue recognition criteria for each deliverable are met 
we derive revenue primarily from stand alone sales of our products 
in certain cases  our products are sold along with services  which include education  training  installation  and or extended warranty services 
we have established tpe for our training  education and installation services 
these service arrangements are typically short term in nature and are largely completed shortly after delivery of the product 
tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately 
training and education services are based on a daily rate per person and vary according to the type of class offered 
installation services are based on daily rate per person and vary according to the complexity of the products being installed 
extended warranty services are priced based on the type of product and are sold in one to five year durations 
extended warranty services include the right to warranty coverage beyond the standard warranty period 
in substantially all of the arrangements with multiple deliverables pertaining to arrangements with these services  we have used and intend to continue using vsoe to determine the selling price for the services 
consistent with our methodology under previous accounting guidance  we determine vsoe based on our normal pricing practices for these specific services when sold separately 
in most instances  particularly as it relates to products  we are not able to establish vsoe for all deliverables in an arrangement with multiple elements 
this may be due to infrequently selling each element separately  not pricing products within a narrow range  or only having a limited sales history 
when vsoe cannot be established  we attempt to establish the selling price of each element based on tpe 
generally  our marketing strategy differs from that of our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of customization and differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained 
furthermore  we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor products selling prices are on a stand alone basis 
therefore  we are typically not able to determine tpe for our products 
when we are unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe  we use bsp 
the objective of bsp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand alone basis 
the bsp of each deliverable is determined using average discounts from list price from historical sales transactions or cost plus margin approaches based on the factors  including but not limited to our gross margin objectives and pricing practices plus customer and market specific considerations 
the adoption did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  and is not expected to have a material effect on future periods 
allowances for sales returns and doubtful accounts we record an allowance for sales returns for estimated future product returns related to current period product revenue 
the allowance for sales returns is recorded as a reduction of revenue and an allowance against 
table of contents our accounts receivable 
we base our allowance for sales returns on periodic assessments of historical trends in product return rates and current approved returned products 
if the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established  our future revenue could be adversely affected 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make payments for amounts owed to us 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded as a charge to general and administrative expenses 
we base our allowance on periodic assessments of our customers liquidity and financial condition through analysis of information obtained from credit rating agencies  financial statement reviews and historical collection trends 
additional allowances may be required in the future if the liquidity or financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in impairment in their ability to make payments 
stock based compensation we estimate the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using the black scholes pricing model  which is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
the expected stock price volatility is based on the weighted average of the historical volatility of our common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of our stock options 
we base our expected life assumption on our historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock awards we grant to employees 
risk free interest rates reflect the yield on zero coupon us treasury securities 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero 
if factors change  and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income  net loss and net loss per share 
we are also required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
in addition  stock based compensation expense was recorded for options issued to non employees 
these options are generally immediately exercisable and expire seven to ten years from the date of grant 
we value non employee options using the black scholes model 
non employee options subject to vesting are valued as they become vested 
in  we completed the exchange of certain stock options issued to eligible employees  officers and directors of zhone under our equity incentive compensation plans in the exchange offer 
on march   our board of directors approved the acceleration of vesting of all unvested options to purchase shares of zhone common stock issued in connection with the exchange offer that were held by members of our senior management 
the acceleration was effective as of march  options to purchase an aggregate of approximately million shares of zhone common stock were subject to the acceleration and resulted in a compensation charge of million which was fully expensed in the three month period ended march  the acceleration of these options was undertaken in recognition of the achievement of certain performance objectives by our senior management 
on august   our board of directors approved the acceleration of vesting of all unvested options to purchase shares of zhone common stock that were held by members of our senior management as of that date 
the acceleration was effective as of september  options to purchase an aggregate of approximately million shares of zhone common stock were subject to the acceleration and resulted in a compensation charge of million which was fully expensed in the three month period ended september  the acceleration of these options was undertaken to partially offset previous reductions in cash compensation and other benefits by our senior management 

table of contents inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
in assessing the net realizable value of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare these with the current or committed inventory levels 
once inventory has been written down to its estimated net realizable value  its carrying value cannot be increased due to subsequent changes in demand forecasts 
to the extent that a severe decline in forecasted demand occurs  or we experience a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence due to rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  we may incur significant charges for excess inventory 
accounting for impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be fully recoverable based on expected undiscounted cash flows attributable to that asset 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future net undiscounted cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
any assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and would no longer be depreciated 
the assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 
during the year ended december   we recorded impairment charges of million related to the impairment of long lived assets as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
operating lease liabilities as a result of our acquisition of paradyne in september  we assumed certain lease liabilities for facilities in largo  florida 
we have accrued a liability for the excess portion of these facilities 
the computation of the estimated liability includes a number of assumptions and subjective variables 
these variables include the level and timing of future sublease income  amount of contractual variable costs  future market rental rates  discount rate  and other estimated expenses 
if circumstances change  and we employ different assumptions in future periods  the lease liability may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our net loss and net loss per share 
during  we assumed that we would no longer be able to sublease the remaining excess space due to the continued deterioration in the real estate market 
accordingly  during  we increased our excess lease liability balance by million  with a corresponding charge to general and administrative expenses

we anticipate that our results of operations in any given period may depend to a large extent on sales to a small number of large accounts 
as a result  our revenue for any quarter may be subject to significant volatility based upon changes in orders from one or a small number of key customers 
cost of revenue and gross profit total cost of revenue  including stock based compensation  increased million or to million for  compared to million for the increase was primarily due to an increase in non personnel expenses compared to the prior year

total cost of revenue was of net revenue for  compared to of net revenue for  which resulted in a decrease in gross profit percentage from in to in the gross margin decreased as compared with prior periods primarily due to decreased sales volume and the increase in cost of revenue for the period resulting from greater sales of products with lower gross margin  such as our gpon products 
we expect that in the future  our cost of revenue as a percentage of net revenue will vary depending on the mix and average selling prices of products sold in the future 
in addition  continued competitive and economic pressures could cause us to reduce our prices  adjust the carrying values of our inventory  or record inventory charges relating to discontinued products and excess or obsolete inventory 
research and product development expenses research and product development expenses increased or million to million for compared to million for the increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel related expenses resulting from a slightly higher headcount in as compared with we intend to continue to invest in research and product development to attain our strategic product development objectives  while seeking to manage the associated costs through expense controls

after determining there were indicators of impairment  we proceeded to test for impairment and concluded that an impairment charge was required 
the impairment charges were incurred to write down the value of our fixed assets to fair value  as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements 
there were no similar impairment charges incurred in interest expense interest expense for decreased by million to zero compared to million in  primarily due to a decrease in outstanding debt balances and continued low interest rates during this includes the effect of our september extinguishment of debt associated with the sale of our oakland  california campus as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements

other performance measures in managing our business and assessing our financial performance  we supplement the information provided by our gaap results with adjusted earnings before stock based compensation  interest  taxes  and depreciation  or adjusted ebitda  a non gaap financial measure 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss plus i interest expense  ii provision benefit for taxes  iii depreciation and amortization  iv non cash equity based compensation expense  and v material non recurring non cash transactions  such as a gain loss on sale of assets or impairment of fixed assets 
we believe that the presentation of adjusted ebitda enhances the usefulness of our financial information by presenting a measure that management uses internally to monitor and evaluate our operating performance and to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies 
we believe adjusted ebitda also assists investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis because it excludes the impact of items that we do not believe reflect our core operating performance 
adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool 
some of these limitations are adjusted ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures  or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual requirements  adjusted ebitda does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  adjusted ebitda does not reflect the interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments  on our debts  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future  and adjusted ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  non cash compensation is and will remain a key element of our overall long term incentive compensation package  although we exclude it as an expense when evaluating our ongoing operating performance for a particular period  adjusted ebitda does not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations  and other companies in our industry may calculate adjusted ebitda and similar measures differently than we do  limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure 
because of these limitations  adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income loss or any other performance measures calculated in accordance with gaap or as a measure of liquidity 
management understands these limitations and compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results and using adjusted ebitda only supplementally 

table of contents set forth below is a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income loss  which we consider to be the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to adjusted ebitda year ended december  in thousands net loss add interest expense income tax provision benefit depreciation and amortization non cash equity based compensation expense non cash material non recurring transactions adjusted ebitda the non cash material non recurring transaction represents the impairment of fixed assets recorded in the fourth quarter of the non cash material non recurring transaction represents the gain on the sale of assets recorded in the third quarter of resulting from our campus sale leaseback transaction 
liquidity and capital resources our operations are financed through a combination of our existing cash  cash equivalents  available credit facilities  and sales of equity and debt instruments  based on our operating requirements and market conditions 
at december   cash and cash equivalents were million compared to million at december  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million was attributable to net cash used in operating activities and investing activities of million and million  respectively  offset by net cash provided by financing activities of million 
operating activities for fiscal year  net cash used in operating activities consisted of a net loss of million  adjusted for non cash charges totaling million and an increase in operating assets totaling million 
the most significant components of the changes in net operating assets were an increase in accounts receivable of million and a decrease in accrued and other liabilities of million  partially offset by a decrease in inventories of million 
the increase in accounts receivable related to the timing of cash collections 
the main driver for the decrease in accrued and other liabilities related to a decrease of million related to payments made under the largo lease liability  as well as  a non cash decrease of million due to the continued amortization of our deferred gain and leasehold improvement liabilities in connection with our oakland campus 
lastly  the decrease in inventories was primarily due to better utilization of inventory during for fiscal year  net cash provided by operating activities consisted of a net loss of million  adjusted for non cash charges totaling million and a decrease in operating assets totaling million 
the most significant components of the changes in net operating assets were a decrease in accounts receivable of million partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable of million 
the decrease in accounts receivable related to significant cash collections  primarily related to etisalat  which were in turn used to pay down outstanding payables causing the related decrease in the accounts payable balance 
investing activities for fiscal year  net cash used in investing activities consisted of purchases of property and equipment of million related mainly to the continued build out of our oakland campus lab facilities 

table of contents for fiscal year  net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of purchases of property and equipment of million offset by proceeds from the sale of our oakland  california campus and extinguishment of related debt of million as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements and proceeds from the maturity of short term investments of million 
as part of our september sale and leaseback transaction with lba realty  we moved into another building at the oakland location and performed significant build out of new labs and redesigned office spaces resulting in an increase in property and equipment purchases as compared to financing activities for fiscal year  net cash provided by financing activities consisted of net advances under the svb facility of million  and proceeds related to exercise of stock options and purchases made under our employee stock purchase plan  or espp  of million 
for fiscal year  net cash used in financing activities consisted of repayment of the secured real estate debt of million for the period before the sale of the oakland  california campus and extinguishment of the related debt transaction as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements 
this was partially offset by the proceeds related to exercise of stock options and purchases made under our espp of million 
cash management our primary source of liquidity comes from our cash and cash equivalents  which totaled million at december   and our new million wfb facility 
our cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by third party financial institutions and consist of invested cash and cash in our operating accounts 
at current revenue levels  we anticipate that some portion of our existing cash and cash equivalents will continue to be consumed by operations 
we had million outstanding at december  under our former svb facility 
in addition  million was committed as security for various letters of credit and million was unused and available for borrowing under our former svb facility as of december  the amounts borrowed under the svb facility bore interest  payable monthly  at a floating rate equal to the wall street journal prime rate plus a margin of  depending on our quarterly ebitda as defined in the agreement 
the interest rate on our svb facility was at december  to maintain availability of funds under the svb facility  we paid a commitment fee on the unused portion 
the commitment fee was and was recorded as interest expense 
in january  we repaid the million outstanding under the svb facility  and the svb facility expired on march  our obligations under the svb facility were secured by substantially all of our personal property assets and those of our subsidiaries  including our intellectual property 
the svb facility contained certain financial covenants  and customary affirmative covenants and negative covenants 
as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
on march   we entered into our new wfb facility with wfb to replace our former svb facility and provide us with liquidity and working capital through march  amounts borrowed under the wfb facility bear interest  payable monthly  at a floating rate equal to the three month libor plus a margin of 
the amount that we are able to borrow under the wfb facility varies based on eligible accounts receivable  as defined in the agreement  as long as the aggregate principal amount outstanding does not exceed million less the amount committed as security for various letters of credit  which at december  was million 
in addition  under the wfb facility  we are able to utilize the facility as security for letters of credit 
to maintain availability of funds under the wfb facility  we pay a commitment fee on the unused portion

if we do not comply with the various covenants and other requirements under the wfb facility  wfb is entitled to  among other things  require the immediate repayment of all outstanding amounts and sell our assets to satisfy the obligations under the wfb facility 
we make no assurances that we will be in compliance with these covenants in the future 
future requirements and funding sources our fixed commitments for cash expenditures consist primarily of payments under operating leases  inventory purchase commitments  and payments of principal and interest for debt obligations 
as a result of the paradyne acquisition in  we assumed a lease commitment for facilities in largo  florida 
the term of the lease expires in june and had an estimated remaining obligation of approximately million as of december  we intend to continue to occupy only a portion of these facilities and are evaluating our options to exit the excess portion of the lease 
we have recorded a liability of million as of december   which we believe is adequate to cover costs incurred to exit the excess portion of these facilities  net of estimated sublease income 
our operating lease commitments also include million of future minimum lease payments spread over the five year lease term under the lease agreement we entered into with lba realty in september with respect to our oakland  california campus following the sale of our campus to lba realty in a sale leaseback transaction 
as a result of the financial demands of major network deployments and the difficulty in accessing capital markets  network service providers continue to request financing assistance from their suppliers 
from time to time  we may provide or commit to extend credit or credit support to our customers 
this financing may include extending the terms for product payments to customers 
depending upon market conditions  we may seek to factor these arrangements to financial institutions and investors to reduce the amount of our financial commitments associated with such arrangements 
our ability to provide customer financing is limited and depends upon a number of factors  including our capital structure  the level of our available credit and our ability to factor commitments to third parties 
any extension of financing to our customers will limit the capital that we have available for other uses 
our accounts receivable  while not considered a primary source of liquidity  represent a concentration of credit risk because a significant portion of the accounts receivable balance at any point in time typically consists of a relatively small number of customer account balances 
as of december   etisalat accounted for of net accounts receivable  and receivables from customers in countries other than the united states of america represented of net accounts receivable 
we do not currently have any material commitments for capital expenditures  or any other material commitments aside from operating leases for our facilities  inventory purchase commitments and debt 
we expect that operating losses and negative cash flows from operations may continue 
in order to meet our liquidity needs and finance our capital expenditures and working capital needs for our business  we may be required to sell assets  issue debt or equity securities or borrow on unfavorable terms 
continued uncertainty regarding financial institutions ability and inclination to lend may negatively impact our ability to access debt financing or to refinance existing indebtedness in the future on favorable terms  or at all 
we may be unable to sell assets  issue securities or access additional indebtedness to meet these needs on favorable terms  or at all 
if additional capital is raised through the issuance of debt securities or other debt financing  the terms of such debt may include covenants  restrictions and financial ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business 
likewise  any equity financing could result in additional dilution of our stockholders 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital or are required to obtain additional capital on terms that are not favorable to us  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and sales and marketing efforts beyond the reductions we have previously taken 
based on our current plans and business conditions  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and available credit facilities will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future
