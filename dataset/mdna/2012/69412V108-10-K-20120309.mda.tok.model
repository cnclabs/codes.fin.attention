nm not meaningful results of operations overview the company recorded net income of  for compared to net income of  in the improvement in net income over the prior year was due to increased operating revenues and a lower provision for loan losses 
improvement in these two areas was partially offset by an increase in noninterest expenses 
improvement in operating revenue was primarily the result of a  increase in noninterest income 
an increase in gains on the sale of securities including otti recorded accounted for  of the total improvement in noninterest income 
the provision for loan losses in was  down  from the  recorded in this decline in the provision for loan losses was due to a significant reduction in classified assets combined with reductions in nonperforming assets 
noninterest expense for the year was  a  or percent increase over the increase in noninterest expense was due to higher costs associated with problem assets  specifically legal fees related to problem loans  other real estate expenses  particularly valuation write downs on other real estate owned  and repossession and collection expense 

table of contents for the year  the company recorded net income of  compared to a net loss of  in the increase in income from the prior year was primarily due to a reduction in exposure to construction and land development loans which led to lower provision for loan losses in  as net credit losses decreased significantly 
the company s earnings before provision for loan losses and taxes were  down percent from the prior year 
the decline in earnings before provision for loan losses and taxes when compared to the prior year was due to a  drop in operating revenue defined as net interest income plus noninterest income combined with a  increase in noninterest expense 
the decrease in operating revenue was due to a  drop in net interest income  which was partially offset by a increase in noninterest income 
net interest income fell in when compared to primarily due to changes in the asset mix and subsequent margin compression 
year end assets at december   were  up  or percent from december   asset totals

growth in these asset categories was partially offset by a  contraction in net loans outstanding 
the company s outstanding deposits were relatively unchanged at december   when compared to the prior year end as core deposits remained relatively flat with a year ago 
however  the company s core deposit base has increased by  or percent since december  average assets for the year were  up  over  as growth in average securities and investments was partially offset by a decline in average loans 
average core deposits for the year were  up  or percent over with average demand deposits showing a percent increase over during  the company believes the following factors could impact reported financial results the recent national  regional  and local recession and its continuing effect on loan demand  the credit quality of existing clients with lending relationships  unemployment rates  and vacancy rates of commercial real estate properties since a significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate 
a slowing real estate market  and increases in residential home inventories for sale  and the impact on residential construction lending  delinquency and default rates of existing residential construction loans in the company s portfolio  residential mortgage lending and refinancing activities of existing homeowners 
changes and volatility in interest rates negatively impacting yields on earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities  thus negatively affecting the net interest margin and net interest income 
the availability of wholesale funding sources due to disruption in the financial and capital markets

the ability to attract and retain qualified and experienced bankers in all markets 
reconciliation of non gaap financial information management utilizes certain non gaap financial measures to monitor the company s performance 
while we believe the presentation of non gaap financial measures provides additional insight into our operating performance  readers of this report are urged to review the gaap results as presented in the financial statements and supplementary data in item below 

table of contents the company presents a computation of tangible equity along with tangible book value and return on average tangible equity 
the company defines tangible equity as total shareholders equity before goodwill and core deposit intangible assets 
tangible book value is calculated as tangible equity divided by total shares outstanding 
return on average tangible equity is calculated as net income divided by average tangible equity 
we believe that tangible equity and certain tangible equity ratios are meaningful measures of capital adequacy which may be used when making period to period and company to company comparisons 
tangible equity and tangible equity ratios are considered to be non gaap financial measures and should be viewed in conjunction with total shareholders equity  book value and return on average equity 
the following table presents a reconciliation of total shareholders equity to tangible equity 
total shareholders equity subtract goodwill core deposit intangibles tangible shareholders equity non gaap book value tangible book value non gaap return on average equity return on average tangible equity non gaap non gaap financial measures have inherent limitations  are not required to be uniformly applied  and are not audited 
although we believe these non gaap financial measure are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company  they have limitations as analytical tools  and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under gaap 
summary of critical accounting policies we follow accounting standards set by the financial accounting standards board  commonly referred to as the fasb 
the fasb sets generally accepted accounting principles gaap that we follow to ensure we consistently report our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
references to gaap issued by the fasb in this report are to the fasb accounting standards codification  sometimes referred to as the codification or asc 
the fasb finalized the codification effective for periods ending on or after september  prior fasb statements  interpretations  positions  eitf consensuses  and aicpa statements of position are no longer being issued by the fasb 
the codification does not change how the company accounts for its transactions or the nature of related disclosures made 
however  when referring to guidance issued by the fasb  the company refers to topics in the asc rather than the specific fasb statement 
we have updated references to gaap in this report to reflect the guidance in the codification 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require the application of management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in future periods 
significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   in item of this report 
management believes that the following policies and those disclosed in the notes to consolidated financial statements should be considered critical under the sec definition 
table of contents nonaccrual loans accrual of interest is discontinued on contractually delinquent loans when management believes that  after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts  the borrower s financial condition is such that collection of principal or interest is doubtful 
at a minimum  loans that are past due as to maturity or payment of principal or interest by days or more are placed on nonaccrual status  unless such loans are well secured and in the process of collection 
interest income is subsequently recognized only to the extent cash payments are received satisfying all delinquent principal and interest amounts  and the prospects for future payments in accordance with the loan agreement appear relatively certain 
in accordance with gaap  payments received on nonaccrual loans are applied to the principal balance and no interest income is recognized 
allowance for loan losses and reserve for unfunded commitments the allowance for loan losses on outstanding loans is classified as a contra asset account offsetting outstanding loans  and the allowance for unfunded commitments is classified as an other liability on the balance sheet 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged against earnings 
the balances of the allowance for loan losses for outstanding loans and unfunded commitments are maintained at an amount management believes will be adequate to absorb known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio and commitments to loan funds 
the appropriate balance of the allowance for loan losses is determined by applying loss factors to the credit exposure from outstanding loans and unfunded loan commitments 
estimated loss factors are based on subjective measurements including management s assessment of the internal risk classifications  changes in the nature of the loan portfolios  industry concentrations  and the impact of current local  regional  and national economic factors on the quality of the loan portfolio 
changes in these estimates and assumptions are reasonably possible and may have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements  results of operations or liquidity 
troubled debt restructurings in the normal course of business  the company may modify the terms of certain loans  attempting to protect as much of its investment as possible 
management evaluates the circumstances surrounding each modification to determine whether it is a troubled debt restructuring tdr 
tdrs exist when the restructuring constitutes a concession  and the debtor is experiencing financial difficulties 
additional information regarding the company s troubled debt restructurings can be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item goodwill and intangible assets at december   the company had  in goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with financial accounting standards  assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized  but instead are periodically tested for impairment 
management performs an impairment analysis of its goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually and has determined that there was no impairment as of december   and share based compensation consistent with the provisions of fasb asc  stock compensation  a revision to the previously issued guidance on accounting for stock options and other forms of equity based compensation  we recognize expense for the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based forms of compensation issued to employees over the employees requisite service period generally the vesting period 
the requisite service period may be subject to performance conditions 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated as of the grant date using the black scholes option pricing model 
management assumptions utilized at the time of grant impact the fair value of the option calculated under the black scholes methodology  and ultimately  the expense that will be recognized over the life of the option 
additional information is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item  below 

table of contents fair value measurements generally accepted accounting principles define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
fasb asc  fair value measurements  establishes a three level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value 
the classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used for measurement are observable or unobservable 
observable inputs reflect market derived or market based information obtained from independent sources while unobservable inputs reflect our estimates about market data 
in general  fair values determined by level inputs utilize quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets that the company has the ability to access 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize inputs other than quoted prices included in level that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly 
level inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability  such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals 
level inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability and include situations where there is little  if any  market activity for the asset or liability 
in certain cases  the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy 
in such cases  the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
the company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment  and considers factors specific to the asset or liability 
recent accounting pronouncements recent accounting pronouncements are discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   in item of this report 
none of these pronouncements are expected to have a significant effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
results of operations net interest income the largest component of the company s earnings is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income derived from earning assets  principally loans  and the interest expense associated with interest bearing liabilities  principally deposits 
the volume and mix of earning assets and funding sources  market rates of interest  demand for loans  and the availability of deposits affect net interest income 
th quarter compared to th quarter two tables follow which analyze the changes in net interest income for the fourth quarter and fourth quarter table i  average balance analysis of net interest income  provides information with regard to average balances of assets and liabilities  as well as associated dollar amounts of interest income and interest expense  relevant average yields or rates  and net interest income as a percent of average earning assets 
net interest income and the net interest margin for all periods reported have been adjusted to a tax equivalent basis using a percent tax rate 
table ii  analysis of changes in interest income and interest expense  shows the increase decrease in the dollar amount of interest income and interest expense and the differences attributable to changes in either volume or rates 
net interest margin as a percentage of average earning assets for fourth quarter was percent  down basis points from the percent margin reported for fourth quarter the company s cost of funds declined despite a write off of a broker discount on a brokered time deposit called during the quarter 
earning asset yields in fourth quarter were percent  down basis points from the fourth quarter yields of percent 
this decline was primarily due to a basis point drop in yields on the company s taxable portion of the securities portfolio 

table of contents the first quarter net interest margin is currently projected to be lower than the fourth quarter the margin compression projected in the first quarter relates to the following factors higher prepayments on the mortgage backed portion of the securities portfolio  which will accelerate premium amortization and lower portfolio yields  lower rates on new loan production  rate reductions on existing loans in the portfolio due to competitive pressures  and write downs of discounts associated with calling in long term brokered cds 
at its january meeting  the federal reserve left short term market interest rates unchanged with stated overnight federal funds rate in a range from percent to percent  and the prime lending rate at percent  both historical lows 
the federal reserve stated that this historically low rate environment is expected to persist through at least mid the longer portion of the yield curve is still expected to be volatile as the market responds to the federal reserve actions and global economic events 
table i shows that earning asset yields declined by basis points in fourth quarter from fourth quarter from percent to percent 
this decline in earning asset yields was primarily attributable a significant change in the earning asset mix in fourth quarter when compared to the same quarter last year and a lower yield on the securities portfolio 
in fourth quarter  average securities held for sale with a weighted average yield of percent totaled  and represented percent of total average earning assets and loans yielding percent represented percent of total average earning assets 
this compares to fourth quarter  when the average securities portfolio was  with a weighted average yield of percent and represented percent of total average earning assets  while loans yielding percent represented percent of total average earning assets 
while earning asset yields dropped basis points in fourth quarter compared to fourth quarter  the cost of interest bearing liabilities declined by basis points 
table i shows that the cost of interest bearing core deposits fell by basis points from percent in fourth quarter to percent in fourth quarter  and declines in rates are evident in all core deposit categories 
the cost of wholesale funding also moved down from percent in fourth quarter to percent in fourth quarter all categories of wholesale funding showed a decline in rates 
table ii shows the changes in net interest income due to rate and volume for the quarter ended december   as compared to the quarter ended december  fourth quarter interest income including loan fees declined by from  with higher volumes of earning assets increasing interest income by  which was more than offset by a decline in interest income due to lower rates 
the decline in interest income in fourth quarter when compared to the same quarter one year ago was more than offset by a  drop in interest expense 
the rate volume analysis shows interest expense on core deposits and wholesale funding fell by and  respectively
