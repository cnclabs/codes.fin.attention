item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of mack cali realty corporation and the notes thereto collectively  the financial statements 
certain defined terms used herein have the meaning ascribed to them in the financial statements 
executive overview mack cali realty corporation together with its subsidiaries  the company is one of the largest real estate investment trusts reits in the united states 
the company has been involved in all aspects of commercial real estate development  management and ownership for over years and has been a publicly traded reit since the company owns or has interests in properties collectively  the properties  primarily class a office and office flex buildings  totaling approximately million square feet  leased to over  tenants 
the properties are located primarily in suburban markets of the northeast  some with adjacent  company controlled developable land sites able to accommodate up to million square feet of additional commercial space 
the company s strategy is to be a significant real estate owner and operator in its core  high barriers to entry markets  primarily in the northeast 
as an owner of real estate  almost all of the company s earnings and cash flow is derived from rental revenue received pursuant to leased space at the properties 
key factors that affect the company s business and financial results include the following the general economic climate  the occupancy rates of the properties  rental rates on new or renewed leases  tenant improvement and leasing costs incurred to obtain and retain tenants  the extent of early lease terminations  operating expenses  cost of capital  and the extent of acquisitions  development and sales of real estate 
any negative effects of the above key factors could potentially cause a deterioration in the company s revenue and or earnings 
such negative effects could include failure to renew or execute new leases as current leases expire  failure to renew or execute new leases with rental terms at or above the terms of in place leases  and tenant defaults 
a failure to renew or execute new leases as current leases expire or to execute new leases with rental terms at or above the terms of in place leases may be affected by several factors such as the local economic climate  which may be adversely impacted by business layoffs or downsizing  industry slowdowns  changing demographics and other factors  and local real estate conditions  such as oversupply of office and office flex space or competition within the market 
the company s core markets continue to be weak 
the percentage leased in the company s consolidated portfolio of stabilized operating properties was percent at december  as compared to percent at december  and percent at december  percentage leased includes all leases in effect as of the period end date  some of which have commencement dates in the future and leases that expire at the period end date 
leases that expired as of december   and aggregate   and  square feet  respectively  or  and percentage of the net rentable square footage  respectively 
the company believes that vacancy rates may continue to increase and rental rates may continue to decline in some of its markets through and possibly beyond 
as a result  the company s future earnings and cash flow may continue to be negatively impacted by current market conditions 
the company expects that the impact of the current state of the economy  including high unemployment will continue to have a negative effect on the fundamentals of its business  including lower occupancy  reduced effective rents  and increases in defaults and past due accounts 
these conditions would negatively affect the company s future net income and cash flows and could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition 
the remaining portion of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should help the reader understand our transactions  critical accounting policies and estimates  results of operations for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   results of operations for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   liquidity and capital resources

on may   the company placed in service corporate drive  a  square foot office building located in bridgewater  new jersey 
the company incurred total costs on the project of approximately million through december  in august  the company commenced construction of a  square foot office building which is pre leased for years and months  subject to two extension options of between five and years each  to wyndham worldwide 
wyndham currently leases space in neighboring buildings in the mack cali business campus in parsippany  new jersey 
the new building is expected to be delivered to the tenant in the first quarter of at a total estimated cost of approximately million 
on december   the company entered into a development agreement the development agreement with ironstate development llc ironstate for the development of up to million square feet of residential space with associated parking and ancillary retail space on land owned by the company at its harborside financial center complex in jersey city  new jersey the harborside residential project 
the first phase of the project is expected to consist of a parking pedestal to support two high rise towers of approximately apartment units each  and estimated to cost approximately million 
the parties anticipate a fourth quarter ground breaking and the project will be ready for occupancy within approximately two years thereafter 
pursuant to the development agreement  the company and ironstate shall co develop the harborside residential project with ironstate responsible for obtaining all required development permits and approvals 
major decisions with respect to the harborside residential project will require the consent of the company and ironstate 
the company and ironstate will have and percent interests  respectively  in the harborside residential project 
the company will receive capital credit of per approved developable square foot for its land 
the development agreement is subject to obtaining required approvals and development financing as well as numerous customary undertakings  covenants  obligations and conditions 
the company has the right to reasonably determine that any phase of the harborside residential project is not economically viable and may elect not to proceed  subject to certain conditions  with no further obligations to ironstate other than reimbursement to ironstate of all or a portion of the costs incurred by it to obtain any required approvals 
critical accounting policies and estimates the financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
these estimates and assumptions are based on management s historical experience that are believed to be reasonable at the time 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
the company s critical accounting policies are those which require assumptions to be made about matters that are highly uncertain 
different estimates could have a material effect on the company s financial results 
judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies and estimates may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions and circumstances 
rental property rental properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
costs directly related to the acquisition  development and construction of rental properties are capitalized 
capitalized development and construction costs include pre construction costs essential to the development of the property  development and construction costs  interest  property taxes  insurance  salaries and other project costs incurred during the period of development 
interest capitalized by the company for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred  major replacements and betterments  which improve or extend the life of the asset  are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
fully depreciated assets are removed from the accounts 
the company considers a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements  but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity as distinguished from activities such as routine maintenance and cleanup 
if portions of a rental project are substantially completed and occupied by tenants  or held available for occupancy  and other portions have not yet reached that stage  the substantially completed portions are accounted for as a separate project 
the company allocates costs incurred between the portions under construction and the portions substantially completed and held available for occupancy and capitalizes only those costs associated with the portion under construction 
properties are depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the estimated useful lives are as follows leasehold interests remaining lease term buildings and improvements to years tenant improvements the shorter of the term of the related lease or useful life furniture  fixtures and equipment to years upon acquisition of rental property  the company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets  consisting of land  building and improvements  and identified intangible assets and liabilities generally consisting of the fair value of i above and below market leases  ii in place leases and iii tenant relationships 
the company allocates the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values 
the company records goodwill or a gain on bargain purchase if any if the net assets acquired liabilities assumed exceed the purchase consideration of a transaction 
in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired  the company considers information obtained about each property as a result of its due diligence and marketing and leasing activities  and utilizes various valuation methods  such as estimated cash flow projections utilizing appropriate discount and capitalization rates  estimates of replacement costs net of depreciation  and available market information 
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant 
above market and below market lease values for acquired properties are initially recorded based on the present value using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in place lease and ii management s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in place lease  measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above market leases and the remaining initial term plus the term of any below market fixed rate renewal options for below market leases 
the capitalized above market lease values are amortized as a reduction of base rental revenue over the remaining term of the respective leases  and the capitalized below market lease values are amortized as an increase to base rental revenue over the remaining initial terms plus the terms of any below market fixed rate renewal options of the respective leases 
other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in place lease values and tenant relationship values which are based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease and the company s overall relationship with the respective tenant 
factors to be considered by management in its analysis of in place lease values include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease up periods considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases 
in estimating carrying costs  management includes real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods  depending on local market conditions 
in estimating costs to execute similar leases  management considers leasing commissions  legal and other related expenses 
characteristics considered by management in valuing tenant relationships include the nature and extent of the company s existing business relationships with the tenant  growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant  the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals 
the value of in place leases are amortized to expense over the remaining initial terms of the respective leases 
the value of tenant relationship intangibles will be amortized to expense over the anticipated life of the relationships 
on a periodic basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the company s rental properties may be impaired 
in addition to identifying any specific circumstances which may affect a property or properties  management considers other criteria for determining which properties may require assessment for potential impairment 
the criteria considered by management include reviewing low leased percentages  significant near term lease expirations  recently acquired properties  current and historical operating and or cash flow losses  near term mortgage debt maturities or other factors that might impact the company s intent and ability to hold the property 
a property s value is impaired only if management s estimate of the aggregate future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges to be generated by the property is less than the carrying value of the property 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the property 
the company s estimates of aggregate future cash flows expected to be generated by each property are based on a number of assumptions 
these assumptions are generally based on management s experience in its local real estate markets and the effects of current market conditions 
the assumptions are subject to economic and market uncertainties including  among others  demand for space  competition for tenants  changes in market rental rates  and costs to operate each property 
as these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter management s assumptions  the future cash flows estimated by management in its impairment analyses may not be achieved  and actual losses or impairments may be realized in the future 
rental property held for sale and discontinued operations when assets are identified by management as held for sale  the company discontinues depreciating the assets and estimates the sales price  net of selling costs  of such assets 
if  in management s opinion  the net sales price of the assets which have been identified as held for sale is less than the net book value of the assets  a valuation allowance is established 
properties identified as held for sale and or sold are presented in discontinued operations for all periods presented 
if circumstances arise that previously were considered unlikely and  as a result  the company decides not to sell a property previously classified as held for sale  the property is reclassified as held and used 
a property that is reclassified is measured and recorded individually at the lower of a its carrying amount before the property was classified as held for sale  adjusted for any depreciation amortization expense that would have been recognized had the property been continuously classified as held and used  or b the fair value at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell 
investments in unconsolidated joint ventures the company accounts for its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of accounting 
the company applies the equity method by initially recording these investments at cost  as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures  subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions 
accounting standards codification asc  consolidation  provides guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights variable interest entities or vies and the determination of which business enterprise  if any  should consolidate the vies the primary beneficiary 
generally  the consideration of whether an entity is a vie applies when either the equity investors if any lack one or more of the essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest  the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without additional subordinated financial support or the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportionate to their economic interests and the activities of the entity involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor with a disproportionately small voting interest 
on january   the company adopted the updated provisions of asc  which amends fin r to require ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
additionally  asc amends fin r to eliminate the quantitative approach previously required for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity  which was based on determining which enterprise absorbs the majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both 
asc amends certain guidance in interpretation r for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity 
also  asc amends fin r to require enhanced disclosures that will provide users of financial statements with more transparent information about an enterprise s involvement in a variable interest entity 
the enhanced disclosures are required for any enterprise that holds a variable interest in a variable interest entity 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact to the financial statements 
see note investments in unconsolidated joint ventures to the financial statements for disclosures regarding the company s unconsolidated joint ventures 
on a periodic basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the company s investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired 
an investment is impaired only if management s estimate of the value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment  and such decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the value of the investment 
the company s estimates of value for each investment particularly in commercial real estate joint ventures are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including  among others  demand for space  competition for tenants  changes in market rental rates  and operating costs 
as these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter management s assumptions  the values estimated by management in its impairment analyses may not be realized  and actual losses or impairment may be realized in the future 
revenue recognition base rental revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the respective leases 
unbilled rents receivable represents the amount by which straight line rental revenue exceeds rents currently billed in accordance with the lease agreements 
above market and below market lease values for acquired properties are initially recorded based on the present value using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in place lease and ii management s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in place lease  measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below market fixed rate renewal options for below market leases 
the capitalized above market lease values for acquired properties are amortized as a reduction of base rental revenue over the remaining term of the respective leases  and the capitalized below market lease values are amortized as an increase to base rental revenue over the remaining initial terms plus the terms of any below market fixed rate renewal options of the respective leases 
escalations and recoveries from tenants are received from tenants for certain costs as provided in the lease agreements 
these costs generally include real estate taxes  utilities  insurance  common area maintenance and other recoverable costs 
construction services revenue includes fees earned and reimbursements received by the company for providing construction management and general contractor services to clients 
construction services revenue is recognized on the percentage of completion method 
using this method  profits are recorded on the basis of our estimates of the overall profit and percentage of completion of individual contracts 
a portion of the estimated profits is accrued based upon estimates of the percentage of completion of the construction contract 
this revenue recognition method involves inherent risks relating to profit and cost estimates 
real estate services revenue includes property management  facilities management  leasing commission fees and other services  and payroll and related costs reimbursed from clients 
other income includes income from parking spaces leased to tenants  income from tenants for additional services arranged for the company and income from tenants for early lease terminations 
allowance for doubtful accounts management periodically performs a detailed review of amounts due from tenants to determine if accounts receivable balances are impaired based on factors affecting the collectability of those balances 
management s estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts requires management to exercise significant judgment about the timing  frequency and severity of collection losses  which affects the allowance and net income

to the extent that the company s cash flow from operating activities is insufficient to finance its non recurring capital expenditures such as property acquisitions  development and construction costs and other capital expenditures  the company has and expects to continue to finance such activities through borrowings under its revolving credit facility and other debt and equity financings 
the company believes that with the general downturn in the company s markets in recent years  it is reasonably likely that vacancy rates may continue to increase  effective rental rates on new and renewed leases may continue to decrease and tenant installation costs  including concessions  may continue to increase in most or all of its markets in and possibly beyond 
as a result of the potential negative effects on the company s revenue from the overall reduced demand for office space  the company s cash flow could be insufficient to cover increased tenant installation costs over the short term 
if this situation were to occur  the company expects that it would finance any shortfalls through borrowings under its revolving credit facility and other debt and equity financings 
the company expects to meet its short term liquidity requirements generally through its working capital  net cash provided by operating activities and from its revolving credit facility 
the company frequently examines potential property acquisitions and development projects and  at any given time  one or more of such acquisitions or development projects may be under consideration 
accordingly  the ability to fund property acquisitions and development projects is a major part of the company s financing requirements 
the company expects to meet its financing requirements through funds generated from operating activities  to the extent available  proceeds from property sales  long term and short term borrowings including draws on the company s revolving credit facility and the issuance of additional debt and or equity securities

reit restrictions to maintain its qualification as a reit under the code  the company must make annual distributions to its stockholders of at least percent of its reit taxable income  determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains 
moreover  the company intends to continue to make regular quarterly distributions to its common stockholders
