overview as of september   we operated and franchised  jack in the box restaurants  primarily in the western and southern united states  and qdoba restaurants throughout the united states 
our primary source of revenue is from retail sales at jack in the box and qdoba company operated restaurants 
we also derive revenue from jack in the box and qdoba franchise restaurants  including royalties based upon a percent of sales  rents and franchise fees 
historically  we also generated revenue from distribution sales of food and packaging commodities to franchisees  however this function has been outsourced  and franchisees who previously utilized our distribution services now purchase product directly from our distribution service providers or other approved suppliers 
in addition  we recognize gains from the sale of company operated restaurants to franchisees  which are presented as a reduction of operating costs and expenses  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings 
the following summarizes the most significant events occurring in fiscal and certain trends compared to prior years restaurant sales 
sales at restaurants open more than one year same store sales changed as follows jack in the box company franchise system qdoba company franchise system commodity costs 
commodity costs at jack in the box and qdoba company restaurants increased approximately and  respectively  as compared to last year 
we expect overall commodity costs to increase approximately in fiscal compared to fiscal new unit development 
we continued to grow our brands with the opening of new company and franchise operated restaurants 
in  we opened jack in the box and qdoba locations system wide 
franchising program 
we refranchised jack in the box restaurants  while jack in the box franchisees opened a total of restaurants in our jack in the box system was approximately franchised at the end of fiscal  and we plan to ultimately increase franchise ownership to approximately 
during fiscal  we acquired qdoba franchised restaurants and qdoba franchisees opened a total of restaurants 
restructuring costs 
during fiscal  we engaged in a comprehensive review of our organization structure  including evaluating opportunities for outsourcing  restructuring of certain functions and workforce reductions 
as a result  restructuring charges of million were recorded during fiscal distribution outsourcing 
during the fourth quarter of  we began outsourcing our jack in the box distribution business 
as a result  we recorded after tax charges totaling million  or per diluted share  in the fourth quarter of fiscal share repurchases 
pursuant to share repurchase programs authorized by our board of directors  in  we repurchased million shares of our common stock at an average price of per share  including the cost of brokerage fees

as such  company restaurant sales decreased million in and million in as compared with the respective prior year 
the decrease in restaurant sales in both years is due primarily to decreases in the average number of jack in the box company operated restaurants  partially offset by an increase in the number of qdoba company operated restaurants and increases in average unit volumes auvs at our jack in the box and qdoba restaurants

franchise revenues increased million and million in and  respectively  as compared with the respective prior year 
the increase in franchise revenues in both years primarily reflects an increase in the average number of jack in the box franchise restaurants  which contributed additional royalties and rents of approximately million in and million in in  higher auvs at jack in the box franchised restaurants also contributed to the increase and were more than offset by lower revenues from initial franchise fees of million related to a decrease in the number of restaurants sold to and developed by franchisees 
in  the change in franchise revenues as compared with was also impacted by higher franchise fees from increases in the number of restaurants sold to and developed by franchises  an increase in re image contributions to franchisees  which are recorded as a reduction of franchise revenues  and additional revenues in of million from a rd week

the increase in primarily relates to higher commodity costs and the unfavorable impact of product mix and promotions  partially offset by the benefit of selling price increases 
commodity costs increased as follows compared with the prior year vs 
vs 
jack in the box qdoba in  commodity cost increases were driven by higher costs for most commodities other than produce and pork 
in  higher costs for beef  cheese  pork  dairy  eggs and shortening were partially offset by lower costs for poultry and bakery 
beef represents the largest portion  or approximately  of the company s overall commodity spend  and we typically do not enter into fixed price contracts for our beef needs 
for fiscal  we currently expect beef costs to increase approximately  and overall commodities to be higher compared with fiscal payroll and employee benefit costs were of company restaurant sales in  in and in the decrease in reflects leverage from same store sales increases  the benefits of refranchising and the favorable impact of recent qdoba restaurant acquisitions 
in  the decrease relates to same store sales increases and lower insurance costs  offset by increases in unemployment taxes and higher levels of staffing designed to improve the guest experience at our jack in the box restaurants 
occupancy and other costs were of company restaurant sales in and in and the lower percent in and in are due primarily to leverage from same store sales increases  the benefits of refranchising jack in the box restaurants and the favorable impact of recent acquisitions of qdoba franchised restaurants 
these benefits were partially offset in both years by higher depreciation expense related to the jack in the box re image program 
in  the percentages were impacted by higher debit card fees and costs associated with the new menu board and uniform program at jack in the box restaurants 
franchise costs  principally rents and depreciation on properties leased to jack in the box franchisees  increased million in and million in  due primarily to our refranchising strategy 
franchise costs increased to of the related revenues in from in and in the higher percentage in as compared with is primarily due to a decline in revenue from franchise fees and higher rent and depreciation expenses resulting from an increase in the percentage of locations we lease to franchisees  partially offset by lower re image contributions to franchisees 
the percent of sales increase in versus is primarily due to higher psa depreciation expense for refranchised locations relating to our re image program  an increase in re image contributions to franchisees and higher rent and depreciation expense resulting from an increase in the percentage of locations we lease to franchisees

advertising refranchising strategy incentive compensation cash surrender value of coli policies  net pension and postretirement benefits pre opening costs qdoba general and administrative costs hurricane ike insurance proceeds rd week other our refranchising strategy has resulted in a decrease in the number of jack in the box company operated restaurants and the related overhead expenses to manage and support those restaurants  including advertising costs  which are primarily contributions to our marketing funds determined as a percentage of restaurant sales 
as such  advertising costs decreased at jack in the box and were partially offset by higher advertising expenses at qdoba due to an increase in the number of company operated restaurants  as well as same store sales growth at jack in the box and qdoba restaurants 
the higher levels of incentive compensation reflect improvements in the company s results compared with performance goals in and the cash surrender value of our company owned life insurance coli policies  net of changes in our non qualified deferred compensation obligation supported by these policies  are subject to market fluctuations 
the changes in market values had a positive impact of million in compared with a negative impact of million in and a positive impact of million in in  the increase in pension and postretirement benefits principally relates to a decrease in the discount rate as compared with a year ago 
in  the decrease in pension and postretirement benefits expense principally relates to the curtailment of the company s qualified pension plan  whereby participants will no longer accrue benefits after december  the increase in fiscal pre opening costs primarily relates to higher expenses associated with restaurant openings in two new jack in the box markets  as well as an increase in the number of new jack in the box and qdoba company operated restaurants 
in  the decrease in pre opening costs is primarily due to a decrease in the number of new company restaurants compared with fiscal qdoba general and administrative costs increased primarily due to higher overhead to support our growing number of company operated restaurants 
impairment and other charges  net increased million in and decreased million in as compared to the respective prior year 
the following table presents the components of impairment and other charges  net in each year in thousands impairment charges losses on disposition of property and equipment  net costs of closed restaurants primarily lease obligations and other restructuring costs the increase in primarily relates to restructuring costs incurred in connection with the comprehensive review of our organization structure  including evaluating opportunities for outsourcing  restructuring of certain functions and workforce reductions 
restructuring costs consist primarily of pension benefits and severance expenses related to a voluntary early retirement program verp offered by the company and involuntary employee termination costs 
we expect to see the benefits of our restructuring activities  including our early retirement plan  in our cost structure beginning in fiscal to a lesser extent  adjustments made to certain sublease assumptions associated with our lease obligations for closed locations also contributed to the increase in versus a year ago 
fiscal included a charge of million primarily including future lease obligations of million and property and equipment impairment charges of million related to the closure of underperforming jack in the box restaurants 
after consideration of the fiscal closure charge  impairment and other charges  net decreased an additional million in due primarily to declines in costs related to our restaurant re image and new logo program as this program neared completion and lower impairment charges for underperforming jack in the box restaurants as compared with gains on the sale of company operated restaurants to franchisees  net are detailed in the following table dollars in thousands number of restaurants sold to franchisees gains on the sale of company operated restaurants average gain on restaurants sold in  gains on the sale of company operated restaurants include additional gains of million recognized upon the extension of the underlying franchise and lease agreements related to four restaurants sold in a prior year 
gains were impacted by the number of restaurants sold and changes in average gains recognized  which relate to the specific sales and cash flows of those restaurants 
the lower average gains in relate to the sale of markets with lower than average sales volumes and cash flows 
interest expense  net interest expense  net is comprised of the following in thousands interest expense interest income interest expense  net interest expense  net increased million in and million in in  the increase versus a year ago relates principally to higher average borrowings 
the increase in is primarily attributable to an increase in the amortization of deferred finance fees related to the refinancing of our credit facility in and higher average borrowings  offset in part by lower average interest rates 
income taxes the income tax provisions reflect effective tax rates of  and of pretax earnings from continuing operations in  and  respectively 
the changes in tax rates are primarily due to the market performance of insurance investment products used to fund certain non qualified retirement plans 
changes in the cash value of the insurance products are not included in taxable income 
earnings from continuing operations earnings from continuing operations were million  or per diluted share  in  million  or per diluted share  in  and million  or per diluted share  in we estimate that the extra week in fiscal benefited net earnings by approximately million  or per diluted share 
losses from discontinued operations  net as described in note  discontinued operations  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements  the losses from our distribution business have been reported as discontinued operations 
in  and  losses from discontinued operations  net were million  million and million  respectively 
in fiscal  losses from discontinued operations reflect after tax charges of million related to exit costs associated with outsourcing our distribution business  which reduced diluted earnings per share by approximately liquidity and capital resources general our primary sources of short term and long term liquidity are expected to be cash flows from operations  our revolving bank credit facility and the sale and leaseback of certain restaurant properties 
we generally reinvest available cash flows from operations to develop new restaurants or enhance existing restaurants  to reduce debt and to repurchase shares of our common stock 
our cash requirements consist principally of working capital  capital expenditures for new restaurant construction and restaurant renovations  income tax payments  debt service requirements  and obligations related to our benefit plans 
based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth  we expect that cash flows from operations  combined with other financing alternatives in place or available  will be sufficient to meet our capital expenditure  working capital and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future 
as is common in the restaurant industry  we maintain relatively low levels of accounts receivable and inventories and our vendors grant trade credit for purchases such as food and supplies 
we also continually invest in our business through the addition of new units and refurbishment of existing units  which are reflected as long term assets and not as part of working capital 
as a result  we may at times maintain current liabilities in excess of current assets  which results in a working capital deficit 
cash flows the table below summarizes our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities for each of the past three fiscal years in thousands total cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities 
operating cash flows increased million in compared with due primarily to reductions in payments for income taxes million  an increase in minimum rent receipts from franchisees attributable to the timing of collections for october rents million as well as an increase in net income adjusted for non cash items million 
the impact of these increases in cash flows were partially offset by an increase in payments for property rent related to fluctuations in the timing of payments for the month of october million and pension contributions million 
in  operating cash flows increased million compared with due primarily to reductions in payments for the following advertising due to a decrease in the number of company operated restaurants million  income taxes million  property rent related to fluctuations in the timing of payments for the month of october million  pension contributions million and bonuses million 
the impact of these payment reductions were partially offset by a million decrease in net income adjusted for non cash items  a decrease in beverage incentives received resulting from a decline in the number of company operated restaurants million and a decrease in minimum rent receipts from franchisees attributable to the timing of collections for october rents million 
refer to the results of operations section of our md a for a discussion of factors leading to the changes in cash net income 
investing activities 
cash flows used in investing activities increased million in compared with due primarily to lower proceeds from the sale of jack in the box restaurants to franchisees and collections of notes receivable related to prior years refranchising activities  as well as an increase in cash used to acquire qdoba franchise operated restaurants 
the impact of these decreases in cash flows were partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures 
in  cash flows used in investing activities increased million compared with due primarily to an increase in capital expenditures  lower proceeds from assets held for sale and leaseback and an increase in cash used to acquire qdoba franchise operated restaurants  partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the sale of jack in the box restaurants to franchisees and collections of notes receivables related to prior years refranchising activity 
capital expenditures the composition of capital expenditures in each year follows in thousands jack in the box new restaurants restaurant facility improvements other  including corporate qdoba new restaurants other  including corporate consolidated capital expenditures our capital expenditure program includes  among other things  investments in new locations  restaurant remodeling  new equipment and information technology enhancements 
in  capital expenditures decreased million due primarily to a decline in spending related to our jack in the box re image and new logo program which was substantially completed in as well as lower spending for capital maintenance activities and corporate technology 
in  capital expenditures increased million compared with due primarily to higher spending associated with our jack in the box restaurant re image and new logo program  an increase in the number of new qdoba restaurants developed  an increase in the number of jack in the box restaurants rebuilt and the implementation of a new supply chain system 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in spending related to a decrease in the number of new jack in the box restaurants developed 
in fiscal  capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million 
we plan to open approximately new jack in the box and new qdoba company operated restaurants in sale of company operated restaurants we have continued to expand franchise ownership in the jack in the box system primarily through the sale of company operated restaurants to franchisees 
the following table details proceeds received in connection with our refranchising activities dollars in thousands number of restaurants sold to franchisees cash notes receivable total proceeds average proceeds all fiscal years presented include financing provided to facilitate the closing of certain transactions 
as of september   notes receivable related to refranchisings were million 
we expect total proceeds from the sale of jack in the box restaurants in to be minimal based on the number of remaining markets for sale 
assets held for sale and leaseback we use sale and leaseback financing to lower the initial cash investment in our jack in the box restaurants to the cost of the equipment  whenever possible 
the following table summarizes the cash flow activity related to sale and leaseback transactions in each year dollars in thousands number of restaurants sold and leased back proceeds from sale and leaseback transactions purchases of assets intended for sale and leaseback net cash flows related to assets held for sale and leaseback as of september   we had investments of million in approximately operating and under construction restaurant properties that we expect to sell and lease back during fiscal acquisition of franchise operated restaurants in each year  we acquired qdoba franchise restaurants in select markets where we believe there is continued opportunity for restaurant development

franchise finance  llc ffe loans to franchisees during fiscal and  ffe processed loans to qualifying franchisees of million and million  respectively  for use in re imaging their restaurants 
these loans have terms ranging from five to seven years and bear a fixed or variable rate of interest 
for additional information related to ffe  refer to note  variable interest entities  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
financing activities 
cash used in financing activities decreased million in and million in as compared with the previous year 
the decrease in is primarily attributed to a decrease in cash used to repurchase shares of common stock  partially offset by a decrease in borrowings under our credit facility 
in  the decrease is due primarily to higher debt payments in related to the refinancing of our credit facility  offset in part by cash used in to repurchase shares of our common stock and the change in our book overdraft 
credit facility as of september   our credit facility comprised i a million revolving credit facility and ii a term loan maturing on june   bearing interest at london interbank offered rate libor plus 
as part of the credit agreement  we could request the issuance of up to million in letters of credit  the outstanding amount of which reduces the net borrowing capacity under the agreement 
the credit facility required the payment of an annual commitment fee based on the unused portion of the credit facility 
the credit facility s interest rates and the annual commitment rate were based on a financial leverage ratio  as defined in the credit agreement 
we could make voluntary prepayments of the loans under the revolving credit facility and term loan at any time without premium or penalty 
specific events  such as asset sales  certain issuances of debt and insurance and condemnation recoveries  could trigger a mandatory prepayment 
we are subject to a number of customary covenants under our credit facility  including limitations on additional borrowings  acquisitions  loans to franchisees  capital expenditures  lease commitments  stock repurchases  dividend payments and requirements to maintain certain financial ratios 
we were in compliance with all covenants as of september  at september   we had million outstanding under the term loan  borrowings under the revolving credit facility of million and letters of credit outstanding of million 
for additional information related to our credit facility  refer to note  indebtedness  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
refinancing in november  we replaced our existing credit facility with a new five year million senior credit facility  comprised of a million revolving credit facility and million term loan  intended to provide a more flexible capital structure and take advantage of lower interest rates 
proceeds from the refinancing were used to retire the previous senior credit facility that was due in june as of the closing  approximately million of the revolving credit facility was drawn and million was outstanding on the term loan 
both will mature in november  with the term loan having required principal payments of million in each of the first four years after closing  and the balance due in the fifth year 
the interest rate on the new senior credit facility is based on the company s leverage ratio and can range from libor plus to with no floor 
the initial interest rate is libor plus 
for additional information related to our new credit facility  refer to note  subsequent events  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rate swaps to reduce our exposure to rising interest rates under our credit facility  we consider interest rate swaps 
in august  we entered into two forward looking swaps that effectively convert million of our variable rate term loan to a fixed rate basis beginning september through september based on the term loan s applicable margin of as of september   these agreements have an average pay rate of  yielding a fixed rate of 
for additional information related to our interest rate swaps  refer to note  derivative instruments  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
repurchases of common stock during  and  we repurchased approximately million  million and million shares at an aggregate cost of million  million and million  respectively 
as of september   under a plan approved by the board in november  we had an aggregate amount of million remaining for repurchases through november subsequent to the end of fiscal  we repurchased an additional million shares at an aggregate cost of million leaving million remaining under the november authorization 
in november  the board approved a new program to repurchase up to an additional million in shares of our common stock through november off balance sheet arrangements we are not a party to any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources

we maintain a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan qualified plan covering substantially all full time employees hired before january  our policy is to fund our qualified plan at amounts necessary to satisfy the minimum amount required by law  plus additional amounts as determined by management to improve the plan s funded status 
contributions beyond fiscal will depend on pension asset performance  future interest rates  future tax law changes  and future changes in regulatory funding requirements 
based on the funding status of our qualified plan as of our last measurement date  there was no minimum contribution required 
for additional information related to our pension plans  refer to note  retirement plans  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
discussion of critical accounting estimates we have identified the following as our most critical accounting estimates  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and that require management s most subjective and complex judgments 
information regarding our other significant accounting estimates and policies are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
long lived assets property  equipment and certain other assets  including amortized intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment when indicators of impairment are present 
this review generally includes a restaurant level analysis  except when we are actively selling a group of restaurants  in which case we perform our impairment evaluations at the group level 
impairment evaluations for individual restaurants take into consideration a restaurant s operating cash flows  the period of time since a restaurant has been opened or remodeled  refranchising expectations  and the maturity of the related market 
impairment evaluations for a group of restaurants take into consideration the group s expected future cash flows and sales proceeds from bids received  if any  or fair market value based on  among other considerations  the specific sales and cash flows of those restaurants 
if the assets of a restaurant or group of restaurants subject to our impairment evaluation are not recoverable based upon the forecasted  undiscounted cash flows  we recognize an impairment loss as the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds fair value 
our estimates of cash flows used to assess impairment are subject to a high degree of judgment and may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions or changes in operating performance 
during fiscal year  impairment charges to write down certain assets to their estimated fair value were not material 
retirement benefits our defined benefit and other postretirement plans costs and liabilities are determined using several statistical and other factors  which attempt to anticipate future events  including assumptions about the discount rate and expected return on plan assets 
our discount rate is set annually by us  with assistance from our actuaries  and is determined by considering the average of pension yield curves constructed of a population of high quality bonds with a moody s or standard and poor s rating of aa or better meeting certain other criteria 
as of september   our discount rate was for our defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans 
our expected long term rate of return on assets is determined taking into consideration our projected asset allocation and economic forecasts prepared with the assistance of our actuarial consultants 
as of september   our assumed expected long term rate of return was for our qualified defined benefit plan 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower turnover and retirement rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may affect the amount of pension expense we record 
a hypothetical basis point reduction in the assumed discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets would have resulted in an estimated increase of million and million  respectively  in our fiscal pension and postretirement plan expense 
excluding the additional costs for verp incurred in fiscal  we expect our pension and postretirement expense to increase million in fiscal principally due to a decrease in our discount rate from to 
self insurance we are self insured for a portion of our losses related to workers compensation  general liability  automotive  and health benefits 
in estimating our self insurance accruals  we utilize independent actuarial estimates of expected losses  which are based on statistical analysis of historical data 
these assumptions are closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was expected  accruals might not be sufficient  and additional expense may be recorded 
restaurant closing costs restaurant closing costs consist of future lease commitments  net of anticipated sublease rentals and expected ancillary costs 
we record a liability for the net present value of any remaining lease obligations  net of estimated sublease income  at the date we cease using a property 
subsequent adjustments to the liability as a result of changes in estimates of sublease income or lease cancellations are recorded in the period incurred 
the estimates we make related to sublease income are subject to a high degree of judgment and may differ from actual sublease income due to changes in economic conditions  desirability of the sites and other factors 
share based compensation we offer share based compensation plans to attract  retain and incentivize key officers  non employee directors and employees to work toward the financial success of the company 
share based compensation cost for our stock option grants is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value as calculated by an option pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period 
the option pricing models require various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility  forfeiture rates and expected option life 
if any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly  share based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
goodwill and other intangibles we evaluate goodwill and non amortizing intangible assets annually  or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present 
our impairment analyses first include a qualitative assessment to determine whether events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if this assessment results in a less than likelihood that impairment exists  then further analysis is not required 
if the results of these analyses indicate otherwise  then we compare the fair value of the reporting unit for goodwill and the fair value of the intangible asset to their respective carrying values 
if the determined fair values of the respective assets are less than the related carrying amounts  an impairment loss is recognized 
the methods we use to estimate fair value include future cash flow assumptions  which may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions or changes in operating performance 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reviewed our goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets and determined that no impairment existed as of september  legal accruals the company is subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of its business 
a determination of the amount accrued  if any  for these contingencies is made after analysis of each matter 
we continually evaluate such accruals and may increase or decrease accrued amounts as we deem appropriate 
because lawsuits are inherently unpredictable  and unfavorable resolutions could occur  assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgment about future events 
as a result  the amount of ultimate loss may differ from those estimates 
income taxes we estimate certain components of our provision for income taxes 
these estimates include  among other items  depreciation and amortization expense allowable for tax purposes  allowable tax credits  effective rates for state and local income taxes and the tax deductibility of certain other items 
we adjust our effective income tax rate as additional information on outcomes or events becomes available 
our estimates are based on the best available information at the time that we prepare the income tax provision 
we generally file our annual income tax returns several months after our fiscal year end 
income tax returns are subject to audit by federal  state and local governments  generally years after the returns are filed 
these returns could be subject to material adjustments or differing interpretations of the tax laws 
future application of accounting principles in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 presentation of comprehensive income  which was issued to enhance comparability between entities that report under us gaap and international financial reporting standards  and to provide a more consistent method of presenting non owner transactions that affect an entity s equity 
asu eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in stockholders equity and requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements 
this pronouncement is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  early adoption of the new guidance is permitted  and full retrospective application is required 
this pronouncement is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption 
other accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the fasb or other standards setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposure to risks relating to financial instruments is changes in interest rates 
our previous credit facility was comprised of a revolving credit facility and a term loan  bearing interest at an annual rate equal to the prime rate or libor plus an applicable margin based on a financial leverage ratio 
as of september   the applicable margin for the libor based revolving loans and term loan was set at 
as a result of the refinancing of our credit facility  the applicable margin for our libor based revolving loans and term loan was reduced to 
we use interest rate swap agreements to reduce exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
in august  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert million of our variable rate term loan borrowings to a fixed rate basis beginning september through september based on the term loan s applicable margin of as of september   these agreements would have an average pay rate of  yielding a fixed rate of 
subsequent to the refinancing  our fixed rate of was reduced to reflecting the lower applicable margin under the new credit facility 
a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates  based on the outstanding unhedged balance of our revolving credit facility and term loan at september   would result in an estimated increase of million in annual interest expense 
we are also exposed to the impact of commodity and utility price fluctuations 
many of the ingredients we use are commodities or ingredients that are affected by the price of other commodities  weather  seasonality  production  availability and various other factors outside our control 
in order to minimize the impact of fluctuations in price and availability  we monitor the primary commodities we purchase and may enter into purchasing contracts and pricing arrangements when considered to be advantageous 
however  certain commodities remain subject to price fluctuations 
we are exposed to the impact of utility price fluctuations related to unpredictable factors such as weather and various other market conditions outside our control 
our ability to recover in creased costs for commodities and utilities through higher prices is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate 
from time to time  we enter into futures and option contracts to manage these fluctuations 
at september   we had no such contracts in place
