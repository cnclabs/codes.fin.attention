item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the composition of income attributable to indemnity and income attributable to the noncontrolling interest exchange 
note fair value the fair value information within this note has been conformed to this current presentation 
our available for sale and trading securities are recorded at fair value  which is the price that would be received to sell the asset in an orderly transaction between willing market participants as of the measurement date 
valuation techniques used to derive the fair value of our available for sale and trading securities are based upon observable and unobservable inputs 
observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources 
unobservable inputs reflect our own assumptions regarding fair market value for these securities 
although the majority of our prices are obtained from third party sources  we also perform an internal pricing review for securities with low trading volumes in the current market conditions 
financial instruments are categorized based upon the following characteristics or inputs to the valuation techniques level quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets not subject to adjustments or discounts 
level quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  and model derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable 
level instruments whose significant value drivers are unobservable and reflect management s estimate of fair value based upon assumptions used by market participants in an orderly transaction as of the valuation date

table of contents estimates of fair values for our investment portfolio are obtained primarily from nationally recognized pricing services 
our level category includes those securities valued using an exchange traded price provided by the pricing services 
the methodologies used by the pricing services that support a level classification of a financial instrument include multiple verifiable  observable inputs including benchmark yields  reported trades  broker dealer quotes  issuer spreads  two sided markets  benchmark securities  bids  offers and reference data 
pricing service valuations for level securities are based upon proprietary models and are used when observable inputs are not available in illiquid markets 
in limited circumstances we adjust the price received from the pricing services when  in our judgment  a better reflection of fair value is available based upon corroborating information and our knowledge and monitoring of market conditions 
at december   we adjusted one price received from our pricing services to reflect an alternate fair market value 
this alternative fair value was based upon observable market data 
the price difference between the pricing service and the observable market data was less than million 
we perform continuous reviews of the prices obtained from the pricing services 
this includes evaluating the methodology and inputs used by the pricing service to ensure that we determine the proper level classification of the financial instrument 
price variances  including large periodic changes  are investigated and corroborated by market data 
we have reviewed the pricing methodologies of our pricing service as well as other observable inputs  such as benchmark yields  reported trades  issuer spreads  two sided markets  benchmark securities  bids  offers  reference data  and transaction volumes and believe that their prices adequately consider market activity in determining fair value 
our review process continues to evolve based upon accounting guidance and requirements 
when prices from the pricing services are not available  values are determined by obtaining non binding broker quotes and or market comparables 
when available  we obtain multiple quotes for the same security 
the ultimate value for these securities is determined based upon our best estimate of fair value using corroborating market information 
our evaluation includes the consideration of benchmark yields  reported trades  issuer spreads  two sided markets  benchmark securities  bids  offers and reference data 
for certain structured securities in an illiquid market  there may be no prices available from a pricing service and no comparable market quotes available 
in these situations  we value the security using an internally developed  risk adjusted discounted cash flow model

table of contents securities lending program we previously participated in a program whereby marketable securities from our investment portfolio were lent to independent brokers or dealers based upon  among other things  their creditworthiness  in exchange for collateral initially equal to of the value of the securities on loan and are thereafter maintained at a minimum of of the fair value of the securities loaned 
the program was terminated in note goodwill impairment goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would indicate that a triggering event has occurred 
goodwill impairment testing follows a two step process 
in the first step  the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the impairment test is performed for purposes of measuring the impairment 
prior to december   the exchange had million of goodwill attributable to its purchase of efl stock in in the fourth quarter of  the exchange entered into an agreement to purchase indemnity s ownership interest in efl and a valuation of efl was performed by an external independent third party in preparation for the sale  which occurred on march  the valuation resulted in a purchase price determination of of book value 
in response to the valuation and sale price  management concluded that the possibility for impairment existed and step two of the goodwill impairment test was completed to determine the impairment amount 
step two of the impairment test compared the value of new business for efl to the current goodwill balance 
the analysis determined that the value of efl s new business did not support the million goodwill  and an impairment entry was made to write down the entire balance at december  the charge of million decreased the net income attributable to the exchange in note capitalized software development costs we capitalize computer software costs developed or obtained for internal use 
capitalized costs include internal and external labor and overhead  all of which are attributable to indemnity 
capitalization ceases and amortization begins no later than the point at which a computer software project is complete and ready for its intended use

in addition  the deferred tax liability recorded for indemnity s investment in efl increased by million in as a result of a change in the tax rate used to calculate the liability 
this deferred tax charge was required due to indemnity s decision to sell its ownership interest in efl  rather than receiving its share of efl s earnings in the form of future dividends which would have been eligible for an dividends received deduction

the following tables set forth the assumptions used to determine benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost at the periods ended december erie insurance group assumptions used to determine benefit obligations employee pension plan discount rate expected return on plan assets rate of compensation increase serp discount rate rate of compensation increase assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost employee pension plan discount rate expected return on plan assets rate of compensation increase serp discount rate rate of compensation increase rate of compensation increase is age graded 
an equivalent single compensation increase rate of in  and would produce similar results 
pre retirement post retirement 
the two economic assumptions that have the most impact on the postretirement benefit expense are the discount rate and the long term rate of return on plan assets 
the discount rate assumption used to determine the benefit obligation for was and was based upon a yield curve developed from corporate bond yield information 
the construction of these yield curves is based upon yields of corporate bonds rated aa quality 
target yields are developed from bonds at various maturity points and a curve is fitted to those targets 
spot rates zero coupon bond yields are developed from the yield curve and used to discount benefit payment amounts associated with each future year 
the present value of plan benefits is calculated by applying the spot discount rates to projected benefit cash flows 
a single discount rate is then developed to produce the same present value 
this represents the suggested discount rate 
the same methodology was employed to develop the discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation for for  the discount rate assumption used to determine the benefit obligation was based upon a 
table of contents bond matching study that compared projected pension plan benefit flows to the cash flows from a comparable portfolio of fixed maturity instruments rated aa or better with a duration similar to plan liabilities 
the approach used to determine the long term rate of return assumption is derived from expected future returns for each asset category based upon applicable indices and their historical relationships under various market conditions 
these expected future returns were then weighted based upon our target asset allocation percentages for each asset category to produce a best estimate of range of asset return results within which our long term rate of return assumption falls 
defined benefit pension plan and serp the following tables set forth the change in our projected benefit obligation  the change in plan assets  the funded status of the pension plans  the amounts recognized in the consolidated statements of financial position  the accumulated benefit obligation  the amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income  before tax  that are not yet recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost and the components of net periodic benefit cost for the years ended december in millions erie insurance group change in projected benefit obligation benefit obligation at beginning of period service cost interest cost amendments actuarial loss gain benefits paid impact due to settlement benefit obligation at end of period change in plan assets fair value of plan assets at beginning of period actual return loss on plan assets employer contributions benefits paid fair value of plan assets at end of period funded status at end of period amounts recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position current liabilities noncurrent liabilities amounts recognized accumulated benefit obligation  december  amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income  before tax  not yet recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost net actuarial loss prior service cost net amount not yet recognized components of net periodic benefit cost service cost interest cost expected return on plan assets amortization of prior service cost recognized net actuarial loss settlement gain net periodic benefit expense before allocation to affiliates in december  employment agreements for certain members of executive management were signed which incorporated a payment in full of accrued serp benefits as of december in a lump sum payment  after which time no additional serp benefits would accrue 
this resulted in a settlement gain in the market related value of plan assets is used to determine the expected return component of pension benefit cost 
we use a four year averaging method to determine the market related value  under which asset gains or losses that result from returns that differ from our long term rate of return assumption are recognized in the market related value of assets on a level basis over a four year period 
once factored into the market related asset value  these experience losses will be amortized over a period of years  which is the average remaining service period of the employee group in the plan 

table of contents the net actuarial loss was primarily due to the change in the discount rate assumption used to measure the future benefit obligations to in from in the net actuarial loss was primarily due to the change in the discount rate assumption used to measure the future benefit obligations to in from in the cumulative net actuarial loss was offset in by an actuarial gain resulting from actual investment returns that were greater than expected 
also contributing to this gain were assumption changes made based upon actual experience  such as the decrease in the assumed rate of compensation increase 
recognition of this loss is being deferred over the subsequent four year period

a million contribution was made to the plan in january of the employee pension plan utilizes a return seeking and a liability asset matching allocation strategy 
it is based upon the understanding that equity investments are expected to outperform debt investments over the long term  the potential volatility of short term returns from equities is acceptable in exchange for the larger expected long term returns  and a portfolio structured across investment styles and markets both domestic and foreign reduces volatility 
as a result  the employee pension plan s investment portfolio utilizes a broadly diversified asset allocation across domestic and foreign equity and debt markets 
the investment portfolio is composed of commingled pools that are dedicated exclusively to the management of employee benefit plan assets

these measures  which can include various financial measures  are established by the executive compensation and development committee of our board of directors  and are then approved by the board of directors 
a funding qualifier was introduced into the plan in the executive compensation and development committee of our board of directors determined that the plan should first consider the indemnity s financial results before a payout could be made to participants of the plan 
the funding qualifier is based upon indemnity s operating income 
if the funding qualifier is met  each member of executive and senior management becomes eligible for incentive compensation based upon specific performance measures 
the corporate performance measures considered in the plan primarily included the property and casualty group s direct written premium and statutory combined ratio in and also included the reported policy retention ratio in the cost of the plan is charged to operations as the compensation is earned over the performance period of one year

these performance measures are compared to the same performance measures of a peer group of companies 
because the award is based upon a comparison to results of a peer group over a three year period  the award accrual is based upon estimates of probable results for the remaining performance period 
this estimate is subject to variability if our results or the results of the peer group are substantially different than the results we project

we are involved in litigation arising in the ordinary course of conducting business 
in accordance with current accounting standards for loss contingencies and based upon information currently known to us  we establish reserves for litigation when it is probable that a loss associated with a claim or proceeding has been incurred and the amount of the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
when no amount within the range of loss is a better estimate than any other amount  we accrue the minimum amount of the estimable loss 
to the extent that such litigation against us may have an exposure to a loss in excess of the amount we have accrued  we believe that such excess would not be material to our consolidated financial condition  operations or cash flows 
we believe that our accruals for legal proceedings are appropriate and  individually and in the aggregate  are not expected to be material to our consolidated financial condition  operations or cash flows 
for certain legal proceedings  we cannot reasonably estimate losses or a range of loss  particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where the plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages 
various factors  including  but not limited to  the outcome of potentially lengthy discovery and the resolution of important factual questions  may need to be determined before probability can be established or before a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
if the loss contingency in question is not both probable and reasonably estimable  we do not establish an accrual and the matter will continue to be monitored for any developments that would make the loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable 
the outcome of this pending litigation is uncertain  but in our opinion the outcome of each case  individually and in the aggregate  is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial condition  operations or cash flows 
we review all litigation on an ongoing basis when making accrual and disclosure decisions

because of its inherent limitations  internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements
