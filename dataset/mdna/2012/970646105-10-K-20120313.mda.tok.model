general 
our core business is acquiring and leasing pursuant to operating leases  commercial aircraft engines and related aircraft equipment  and the selective sale of such engines  all of which we sometimes refer to as equipment 
as of december   of our leases were operating leases and one was a finance lease 
as of december   we had lessees in countries 
our portfolio is continually changing due to acquisitions and sales 
as of december   our total lease portfolio consisted of engines and related equipment  aircraft and three spare engine parts packages with an aggregate net book value of million 
as of december   we also managed engines and related equipment on behalf of other parties 
on december   we entered into a joint venture called wolf with oasis international leasing usa  inc  which is now known as waha capital pjsc 
wolf completed the purchase of two airbus a aircraft from boeing aircraft holding company for a purchase price of million 
on may   we entered into an agreement with mitsui co  ltd 
to participate in a joint venture formed as a dublin based irish limited company willis mitsui company engine support limited wmes for the purpose of acquiring and leasing iae v a and general electric cf e jet engines 
each partner holds a fifty percent interest in the joint venture 
we actively manage our portfolio and structure our leases to maximize the residual values of our leased assets 
our leasing business focuses on popular stage iii commercial jet engines manufactured by cfmi  general electric  pratt whitney  rolls royce and international aero engines 
these engines are the most widely used engines in the world  powering airbus  boeing  mcdonnell douglas  bombardier and embraer aircraft 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to residual values  estimated asset lives  impairments and bad debts 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  grouped by our activities  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements leasing related activities 
revenue from leasing of aircraft equipment is recognized as operating lease revenue over the terms of the applicable lease agreements 
where collection cannot be reasonably assured  for example  upon a lessee bankruptcy  we do not recognize revenue until cash is received 
we also estimate and charge to income a provision for bad debts based on our experience in the business and with each specific customer and the level of past due accounts 
the 
table of contents financial condition of our customers may deteriorate and result in actual losses exceeding the estimated allowances 
in addition  any deterioration in the financial condition of our customers may adversely affect future lease revenues 
as of december   all but one of our leases are accounted for as operating leases 
under an operating lease  we retain title to the leased equipment  thereby retaining the potential benefit and assuming the risk of the residual value of the leased equipment 
we generally depreciate engines on a straight line basis over years to a residual value 
spare parts packages are generally depreciated on a straight line basis over years to a residual value 
aircraft are generally depreciated on a straight line basis over years to a residual value 
for equipment which is unlikely to be repaired at the end of its current expected life  and is likely to be disassembled upon lease termination  we depreciate the equipment over its estimated life to a residual value based on an estimate of the wholesale value of the parts after disassembly 
currently  engines having a net book value of million are depreciated using this policy 
it is our policy to review estimates regularly to accurately expense the cost of equipment over the useful life of the engines 
on july  and again on july   we adjusted the depreciation for certain older engine types within the portfolio 
the change in depreciation estimate had no significant impact to the net income and diluted earnings per share over what they would have otherwise been had the change to depreciation not been made 
if useful lives or residual values are lower than those estimated by us  future write downs may be recorded or a loss may be realized upon sale of the equipment 
sales related activities 
for equipment sold out of our lease portfolio  we recognize the gain or loss associated with the sale as revenue 
gains or losses consist of sales proceeds less the net book value of the equipment sold and any costs directly associated with the sale 
asset valuation 
long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable  and long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
impairment is identified by comparison of undiscounted forecasted cash flows  including estimated sales proceeds  over the life of the asset with the asset s book value 
if the forecasted undiscounted cash flows are less than the book value  we write the asset down to its fair value 
we determine fair value by reference to independent appraisals  quoted market prices eg  an offer to purchase and other factors 
if the undiscounted forecasted cash flows and fair value of our long lived assets decrease in the future we may incur impairment charges 
accounting for maintenance expenditures and maintenance reserves 
use fees received are recognized in revenue as maintenance reserve revenue if they are not reimbursable to the lessee 
use fees that are reimbursable are recorded as a maintenance reserve liability until they are reimbursed to the lessee or the lease terminates  at which time they are recognized in revenue as maintenance reserve revenue 
our expenditures for maintenance are expensed as incurred 
expenditures that meet the criteria for capitalization are recorded as an addition to equipment recorded on the balance sheet

cash flow from operating activities generated million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
our primary use of funds is for the purchase of equipment for lease 
purchases of equipment including capitalized costs totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash flows from operations are driven significantly by payments made under our lease agreements  which comprise lease revenue and maintenance reserves  and are offset by interest expense 
cash received as maintenance reserve payments for some of our engines on lease are restricted per our debt arrangements 
the lease revenue stream  in the short term  is at fixed rates while virtually all of our debt is at variable rates 
if interest rates increase  it is unlikely we could increase lease rates in the short term and this would cause a reduction in our earnings and operating cash flows 
revenue and maintenance reserves are also affected by the amount of equipment off lease 
approximately  by book value  of our assets were on lease at december  compared to approximately at december  the average utilization rate for the year ended december  remained at  the same as a year ago 
if there is an increase in off lease rates or deterioration in lease rates that are not offset by reductions in interest rates  there will be a negative impact on earnings and cash flows from operations

the assets of west and west engine funding llc are not available to satisfy our obligations or any of our affiliates 
west is consolidated for financial statement presentation purposes 
west s ability to make distributions and pay dividends to us is subject to the prior payments of its debt and other obligations and west s maintenance of adequate reserves and capital 
under west  cash is collected in a restricted account  which is used to service the debt and any remaining amounts  after debt service and defined expenses  are distributed to us 
additionally  maintenance reserve payments and lease security deposits are accumulated in restricted accounts and are not available for general use 
cash from maintenance reserve payments is held in the restricted cash account and is subject to a minimum balance established annually based on an engine portfolio maintenance reserve study provided by a third party 
any excess maintenance reserve amounts remain within the restricted cash accounts and may be utilized for the purchase of new engines 
at december  and  one month libor was and  respectively 
virtually all of the above debt requires our ongoing compliance with the covenants of each financing  including debt equity ratios  minimum tangible net worth and minimum interest coverage ratios  and other eligibility criteria including customer and geographic concentration restrictions 
in addition  under these facilities  we can typically borrow to of an engine s net book value and approximately of spare part s net book value 
therefore we must have other available funds for the balance of the purchase price of any new equipment to be purchased or we will not be permitted to draw on these facilities 
many of our facilities are also cross defaulted against other facilities 
if we do not comply with the covenants or eligibility requirements  we may not be permitted to borrow additional funds and accelerated payments may become necessary 
additionally  much of the above debt is secured by engines and to the extent that engines are sold  repayment of that portion of the debt could be required 
we were in compliance with all covenants at december  approximately million of our debt is repayable during which includes the million under our senior term loan 
such repayments primarily consist of scheduled installments due under term loans 
repayments are funded by the use of unrestricted cash reserves and from cash flows from ongoing operations 
the table below summarizes our contractual commitments at december  payment due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations interest payments under long term debt obligations interest payments under derivative rate instruments operating lease obligations purchase obligations total we have estimated the interest payments due under long term debt by applying the interest rates applicable at december  to the remaining debt  adjusted for the estimated debt repayments identified in the table above 
actual interest payments made will vary due to changes in the rates for one month libor 
we have made purchase commitments to secure the purchase of three engines and related equipment for a gross purchase price of million  for delivery in to as at december   non refundable deposits paid related to this purchase commitment were million 
in october  we entered into an agreement with cfm international cfm to purchase new spare aircraft engines 
the agreement specifies that  subject to availability  we may purchase up to 
table of contents a total of cfm b and cfm b spare engines over a five year period  with options to acquire up to an additional engines 
our outstanding purchase orders with cfm for three engines represent deferral of engine deliveries originally scheduled for and are included in our commitments to purchase in to we entered into a new lease effective november  for our offices in novato  california that covers approximately  square feet of office space 
this lease was amended on january  to cover an additional  square feet of office space 
the total remaining rent commitment is approximately million and expires september  the sub lease of our premises in san diego  california expires in october our shanghai  china office lease expires in december our office and living space leases in london  united kingdom expire in december our blagnac  france office lease expires in december we believe our equity base  internally generated funds and existing debt facilities are sufficient to maintain our level of operations through a decline in the level of internally generated funds  such as could result if the amount of equipment off lease increases or there is a decrease in availability under our existing debt facilities  would impair our ability to sustain our level of operations 
we are discussing additions to our capital base with our commercial and investment banks 
if we are not able to access additional capital  our ability to continue to grow our asset base consistent with historical trends will be impaired and our future growth limited to that which can be funded from internally generated capital 
management of interest rate exposure at december   all but million of our borrowings were on a variable rate basis at various interest rates tied to one month libor 
our equipment leases are generally structured at fixed rental rates for specified terms 
increases in interest rates could narrow or result in a negative spread  between the rental revenue we realize under our leases and the interest rate that we pay under our borrowings 
we have entered into interest rate derivative instruments to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk and not to speculate or trade in these derivative products 
we currently have interest rate swap agreements which have notional outstanding amounts of million  with remaining terms of between three and forty months and fixed rates of between and 
the fair value of the swaps at december  and was negative million and negative million  respectively  representing a net liability for us 
we record derivative instruments at fair value as either an asset or liability 
we use derivative instruments primarily interest rate swaps to manage the risk of interest rate fluctuation 
while substantially all our derivative transactions are entered into for the purposes described above  hedge accounting is only applied where specific criteria have been met and it is practicable to do so 
in order to apply hedge accounting  the transaction must be designated as a hedge and the hedge relationship must be highly effective 
the hedging instrument s effectiveness is assessed utilizing regression analysis at the inception of the hedge and on at least a quarterly basis throughout its life 
all of the transactions that we have designated as hedges are accounted for as cash flow hedges 
the effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and is reclassified into earnings in the period during which the transaction being hedged affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of these hedges flows through earnings in the current period 
the hedge accounting for these derivative instrument arrangements increased interest expense by million and million in and  respectively 
this incremental cost for the swaps effective for hedge accounting was included in interest expense for the respective periods 
we will be exposed to risk in the event of non performance of the interest rate hedge counter parties 
we anticipate that we may hedge additional amounts of our floating rate debt during the next year

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposure is that of interest rate risk 
a change in libor rates would affect our cost of borrowing 
increases in interest rates  which may cause us to raise the implicit rates charged to our customers  could result in a reduction in demand for our leases 
alternatively  we may price our leases based on market rates so as to keep the fleet on lease and suffer a decrease in our operating margin due to interest costs that we are unable to pass on to our customers 
all but million of our outstanding debt is variable rate debt 
we estimate that for every one percent increase or decrease in our variable rate debt net of derivative instruments  annual interest expense would increase or decrease million in  million 
we hedge a portion of our borrowings  effectively fixing the rate of these borrowings 
this hedging activity helps protect us against reduced margins on longer term fixed rate leases 
based on the implied forward rates for one month libor  we expect interest expense will be increased by approximately million for the year ending december  as a result of our hedges 
such hedging activities may limit our ability to participate in the benefits of any decrease in interest rates  but may also protect us from increases in interest rates 
furthermore  since lease rates tend to vary with interest rate levels  it is possible that we can adjust lease rates for the effect of change in interest rates at the termination of leases 
other financial assets and liabilities are at fixed rates 
we are also exposed to currency devaluation risk 
during   and  respectively   and of our total lease rent revenues came from non united states domiciled lessees 
all of our leases require payment in us dollars 
if these lessees currency devalues against the us dollar  the lessees could potentially encounter difficulty in making their lease payments
