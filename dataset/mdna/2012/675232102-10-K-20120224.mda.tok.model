item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
certain statements in this annual report on form k  including  without limitation  statements regarding the following matters are forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of our business strategy  our plans for future operations  industry conditions  our expectations about earnings per share and segment operating results  and the factors underlying those expectations  including our expectations about demand for our deepwater oilfield services and products as a result of the factors we specify in the overview below  projections relating to floating rigs to be placed in service and subsea tree orders  the adequacy of our liquidity and capital resources to support our operations and internally generated growth initiatives  our projected capital expenditures for  our plans to add rovs to our fleet  our belief that our goodwill will not be impaired during  the adequacy of our accruals for uninsured expected liabilities from workers compensation  maritime employer s liability and general liability claims  our belief that our total unrecognized tax benefits will not significantly increase or decrease in the next months  our expectations about the cash flows from our investment in medusa spar llc  and the factors underlying those expectations  our backlog  and our expectations regarding the effect of inflation in the near future 
these forward looking statements are subject to various risks  uncertainties and assumptions  including those we refer to under the headings risk factors and cautionary statement concerning forward looking statements in part i of this report 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  because of the inherent limitations in the forecasting process  as well as the relatively volatile nature of the industries in which we operate  we can give no assurance that those expectations will prove to have been correct 
accordingly  evaluation of our future prospects must be made with caution when relying on forward looking information 
overview the table that follows sets out our revenue and operating results for  and year ended december  dollars in thousands revenue gross margin gross margin operating income operating income net income during  we generated approximately of our revenue  and of our operating income  from services and products we provided to the oil and gas industry 
in  our revenue increased by  with the largest increase occurring in our subsea products segment 
our subsea products segment revenue increased from higher umbilical plant throughput and specialty product sales 
the million consolidated net income we earned in was the highest in our history 
the million increase from net income was attributable to higher profit contributions from our subsea products segment  which had million more operating income on million more revenue  and our rov segment  which had million more operating income on million more revenue 

table of contents in  we invested in the following major capital projects business acquisitions totaling million  principally in our asset integrity and subsea products segments  additions of and upgrades to our work class rovs  expenditures for added capacity and geographic expansion in our subsea products segment  and conversion of the ocean patriot to a dynamically positioned saturation diving vessel and completion of its saturation diving system in our subsea projects business 
we expect our diluted earnings per share to be in the range of to  as compared to in we anticipate continued international demand growth and a moderate rebound in overall activity in the us gulf of mexico 
compared to  in we are forecasting an increase in rov operating income as a result of a higher average fleet size and increased demand offshore west africa and in the us gulf of mexico 
we use our rovs in the offshore oil and gas industry to perform a variety of underwater tasks  including drill support  installation and construction support  pipeline inspection and surveys and subsea production facility inspection  repair and maintenance 
the largest percentage of our rovs has historically been used to provide drill support services 
therefore  the number of floating drilling rigs on hire is a leading market indicator for this business 
the following table shows average floating rigs under contract and our rov utilization 
average number of floating rigs under contract rov days on hire in thousands rov utilization demand for floating rigs is our primary driver of future growth prospects 
according to industry data published by ods petrodata  at the end of  there were floating drilling rigs in the world  with of the rigs under contract and of the rigs contracted through sixty eight additional floating rigs were on order  with scheduled to be delivered through  and of these have been contracted long term  for an average term of approximately seven years 
we estimate approximately floating rigs will be placed in service during  and we have rov contracts on eight of those 
competitors have the rov contracts on nine rigs  leaving seven contract opportunities 
in addition to floating rig demand  subsea tree completions are another leading indicator of the strength of the deepwater market and the primary demand driver for our subsea products lines 
according to industry data published by quest offshore resources  inc  there were less than subsea completions before  approximately  in the decade of the s  approximately  in the decade of the s  and quest forecasts over  for the decade of the s 
quest also projects the global market for subsea tree orders is expected to increase in the time period compared to the previous five years 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have based the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations on our consolidated financial statements  which we have prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these principles require us to make various estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the periods we present 
we base our estimates on historical experience  available information and other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  however  our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following discussion summarizes the accounting policies we believe require our management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments and are the most critical to our reporting of results of operations and financial position 
revenue recognition 
we recognize our revenue according to the type of contract involved 
on a daily basis  we recognize revenue under contracts that provide for specific time  material and equipment charges  which we bill periodically  ranging from weekly to monthly 

table of contents we account for significant fixed price contracts  which we enter into mainly in our subsea products segment  and occasionally in our subsea projects and advanced technologies segments  using the percentage of completion method 
in  we accounted for of our revenue using the percentage of completion method 
in determining whether a contract should be accounted for using the percentage of completion method  we consider whether the customer provides specifications for the construction of facilities or production of goods or for the provision of related services  we can reasonably estimate our progress towards completion and our costs  the contract includes provisions as to the enforceable rights regarding the goods or services to be provided  consideration to be received and the manner and terms of payment  the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract  and we can be expected to perform our contractual obligations 
under the percentage of completion method  we recognize estimated contract revenue based on costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated costs 
changes in the expected cost of materials and labor  productivity  scheduling and other factors affect the total estimated costs 
additionally  external factors  including weather or other factors outside of our control  may also affect the progress and estimated cost of a project s completion and  therefore  the timing of income and revenue recognition 
we routinely review estimates related to our contracts and reflect revisions to profitability in earnings immediately 
if a current estimate of total contract cost indicates an ultimate loss on a contract  we recognize the projected loss in full when we determine it 
in prior years  we have recorded adjustments to earnings as a result of revisions to contract estimates 
although we are continually striving to accurately estimate our contract costs and profitability  adjustments to overall contract costs could be significant in future periods 
we recognize the remainder of our revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
long lived assets 
we evaluate our property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be appropriate 
we base these evaluations on a comparison of the assets carrying values to forecasts of undiscounted cash flows associated with the assets or quoted market prices 
if an impairment has occurred  we recognize a loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset 
our expectations regarding future sales and undiscounted cash flows are highly subjective  cover extended periods of time and depend on a number of factors outside our control  such as changes in general economic conditions  laws and regulations 
accordingly  these expectations could differ significantly from year to year 
in  we recorded a million impairment charge as additional depreciation to adjust the carrying value of our vessel held for sale  the performer  to its fair value less estimated costs to sell 
we completed the sale in july for approximately the vessel s reduced carrying value 
the performer was included in our subsea projects segment  and the impairment and result of its sale are included in the gross margin and operating income in the subsea projects segment 
we charge the costs of repair and maintenance of property and equipment to operations as incurred  while we capitalize the costs of improvements that extend asset lives or functionality 
goodwill 
we account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting  with the acquisition price being allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair market values at the date of acquisition 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an update regarding goodwill impairment testing 
under the update  an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
however  if an entity concludes otherwise  then it is required to perform the first step of the two step impairment test 
this update is effective for us january   and earlier adoption is permitted 
we have elected to adopt this update early and apply it in the provisions of the update have not had a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
prior to this fasb update  we tested the goodwill attributable to each of our reporting units for impairment annually  or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amounts may not have been appropriate 
we estimated fair value of the reporting units using both an income approach  which considers a discounted cash flow model  and a market approach 
for reporting units with significant goodwill  we do not believe our goodwill will be impaired during loss contingencies 
we self insure for workers compensation  maritime employer s liability and comprehensive general liability claims to levels we consider financially prudent  and beyond the self insurance level of exposure  we carry insurance  which can be by occurrence or in the aggregate 
we determine the level of accruals for claims exposure by reviewing our 
table of contents historical experience and current year claim activity 
we do not record accruals on a present value basis 
we review larger claims with insurance adjusters and establish specific reserves for known liabilities 
we establish an additional reserve for incidents incurred but not reported to us for each year using our estimates and based on prior experience 
we believe we have established adequate accruals for uninsured expected liabilities arising from those obligations 
however  it is possible that future earnings could be affected by changes in our estimates relating to these matters 
we are involved in various claims and actions against us  most of which are covered by insurance 
we believe that our ultimate liability  if any  that may result from these claims and actions will not materially affect our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
income taxes 
our tax provisions are based on our expected taxable income  statutory rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws 
we are at risk that a taxing authority s final determination of our tax liabilities may differ from our interpretation 
our effective tax rate may fluctuate from year to year as our operations are conducted in different taxing jurisdictions  the amount of pre tax income fluctuates and our estimates regarding the realizability of items such as foreign tax credits may change 
in  and  we recorded reductions of income tax expense of million  million and million  respectively  resulting from a combination of expiring statutes of limitations and the resolution of uncertain tax positions related to certain tax liabilities we recorded in prior years 
current income tax expense represents either nonresident withholding taxes or the liabilities expected to be reflected on our income tax returns for the current year  while the net deferred income tax expense or benefit represents the change in the balance of deferred tax assets or liabilities as reported on our balance sheet 
we establish valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future 
we currently have no valuation allowances 
while we have considered estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowances  changes in these estimates and assumptions  as well as changes in tax laws  could require us to provide for valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets 
these provisions for valuation allowances would impact our income tax provision in the period in which such adjustments are identified and recorded 
we account for any applicable interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as a component of our provision for income taxes on our financial statements 
we charged million to income tax expense in for penalties and interest for uncertain tax positions  which brought our total liabilities for penalties and interest on uncertain tax positions to million on our balance sheet at december  including associated foreign tax credits and penalties and interest  we have accrued a net total of million in the caption other long term liabilities on our balance sheet at december  for unrecognized tax benefits 
all additions or reductions to those liabilities affect our effective income tax rate in the periods of change 
we do not believe that the total of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease in the next months 
for a summary of our major accounting policies and a discussion of recently adopted accounting standards  please see note to our consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources we consider our liquidity and capital resources adequate to support our operations and internally generated growth initiatives 
at december   we had working capital of million  including cash and cash equivalents of million 
additionally  we had million available through a revolving credit facility under a credit agreement the credit agreement  which we replaced in january with a new credit agreement the credit agreement that extends to january our maximum borrowings and our total interest costs under the credit agreement during the year ended december  were million and  respectively 
our net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
simultaneously with the execution of the credit agreement and pursuant to its terms  we repaid all amounts outstanding under  and terminated  the credit agreement 
the credit agreement provides for a five year  million revolving credit facility 
subject to certain conditions  the aggregate commitments under the facility may be increased by up to million by obtaining additional commitments from existing and or new lenders 
borrowings under the facility may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes 
the facility expires on january  revolving borrowings under the facility bear interest at an adjusted base rate or the eurodollar rate as defined in the agreement  at our option  plus an applicable margin 
depending on our debt to capitalization ratio  the applicable margin varies in the case of adjusted base rate advances  from to and in the case of eurodollar advances  from to 
table of contents the credit agreement contains various covenants which we believe are customary for agreements of this nature  including  but not limited to  restrictions on the ability of each of our restricted subsidiaries to incur unsecured debt  as well as restrictions on our ability and the ability of each of our restricted subsidiaries to incur secured debt  grant liens  make certain investments  make distributions  merge or consolidate  sell assets  enter into transactions with affiliates and enter into certain restrictive agreements 
we are also subject to an interest coverage ratio and a debt to capitalization ratio 
the credit agreement includes customary events and consequences of default 
our capital expenditures  including business acquisitions  for  and were million  million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures in included expenditures for the acquisition of agr field operations holdings as and subsidiaries agr fo for million  which are in our asset integrity and subsea projects segments  norse cutting and abandonment as nca for million and mechanica as for million  which are in our subsea products segment  additions and upgrades to our rov fleet  and conversion of the ocean patriot to a dynamically positioned saturation diving vessel and completion of its saturation diving system in our subsea projects segment 
capital expenditures in included expenditures for additions and upgrades to our rov fleet  two vessels and a saturation diving system in our subsea project segment  a business acquisition in our subsea products segment  and modifications to our brazil umbilical manufacturing facility 
capital expenditures in included expenditures for additions and upgrades to our rov fleet  the construction of our own facility to produce control umbilicals for our rovs  and expansion of our specialty subsea products business in foreign markets 
our capital expenditures during  and included million  million and million  respectively  in our rov segment  principally for additions and upgrades to our rov fleet to expand the fleet and replace units we retired and for facilities infrastructure to support our growing rov fleet size 
we plan to continue adding rovs at levels we determine appropriate to meet market opportunities as they arise 
we added  and rovs to our fleet and disposed of  and nine units during  and  respectively  and transferred one to our advanced technologies segment in  resulting in a total of work class systems in the fleet at december  in  we chartered a large deepwater vessel  the ocean intervention iii  for three years  with extension options for up to six additional years 
the initial three year term of the charter began in may  and the term has been extended to may  and we expect to contract for continued use of this vessel 
we also chartered an additional larger deepwater vessel  the olympic intervention iv  for an initial term of five years  which began in the third quarter of we outfitted each of these larger deepwater vessels with two of our high specification work class rovs  and we have utilized these vessels to perform subsea hardware installation and inspection  repair and maintenance projects  and to conduct well intervention services in the ultra deep waters of the us gulf of mexico 
in  we are mobilizing the ocean intervention iii to angola and have chartered the bourbon oceanteam to work on a three year field support contract 
the customer for this contract has the option for us to provide a third vessel and has options to extend the contract for two additional one year periods 
our principal source of cash from operating activities is our net income  adjusted for the non cash expenses of depreciation and amortization  deferred income taxes and noncash compensation under our restricted stock plans 
our million  million and million of cash provided from operating activities in  and  respectively  were affected by cash increases decreases of million  million  and million  respectively  of changes in accounts receivable  million  million and million  respectively  of changes in inventory and million  million and million  respectively  in changes in other operating assets 
in  the increase in accounts receivable was largely attributable to increased revenue in the fourth quarter of compared to the corresponding quarter of  and the mix of revenue with a higher percentage of our revenue coming from our international operations 
in  the change in other operating assets related to increases in refundable income taxes and prepaid expenses 
in  we used million in investing activities  with million used to make the capital expenditures and business acquisitions described above  while we received million from the sales of assets  primarily our offshore production system  the ocean legend 
in  we used million in investing activities  including million to upgrade and add additional units to our rov fleet  million to increase our subsea products capabilities  including an acquisition for million  and million in our subsea projects segment  including expenditures for an additional vessel equipped with a saturation diving system and a replacement diving service vessel 
in  we used million in investing activities  including million on growing and upgrading our rov operations 
in and  we received million and million  respectively  in cash flow from financing activities as proceeds from the sale of our common stock pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options 
at december   we no longer had any stock options outstanding  and we have had no further stock option activity since then 
in addition  in  and 
table of contents  we received million  million and million  respectively  of tax benefit realized from tax deductions in excess of financial statement expense related to our stock based compensation plans 
for a description of our incentive plans  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
in february  our board of directors approved a plan to repurchase up to  shares of our common stock 
the timing and amount of any repurchases will be determined by our management 
we expect that any shares repurchased under the new plan will be held as treasury stock for future use 
the plan does not obligate us to repurchase any particular number of shares 
through december   we repurchased  shares at a cost of million under the plan  including the  shares we repurchased for million during as of december   we retained  shares we had repurchased under this and a prior plan 
we expect that shares we reissue will be primarily in connection with our stock based compensation plans 
because of our significant foreign operations  we are exposed to currency fluctuations and exchange rate risks 
we generally minimize these risks primarily through matching  to the extent possible  revenue and expense in the various currencies in which we operate 
cumulative translation adjustments as of december  relate primarily to our net investments in  including long term loans to  our foreign subsidiaries 
a stronger us dollar against the us pound sterling and the norwegian kroner would result in lower operating income 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
results of operations information on our business segments is shown in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report

these new vehicles are designed for use around the world in water depths of  feet or more 
we added  and rovs in  and  respectively  while disposing of units over the three year period and transferring one to our advanced technologies segment in we plan to continue adding rovs at levels we determine appropriate to meet market opportunities 
for  our rov revenue and operating income increased over from increased days on hire  as we had more systems available and had higher utilization due to increased international demand 
our operating income margin decreased as a result of geographic mix  as our aggregate international rov operations have lower margins than our us gulf of mexico operations 

table of contents for  our rov revenue and operating income increased over from increased revenue per day on hire 
good cost controls helped us keep margin percentages flat despite lower utilization 
we grew our rov fleet size to at december  from at december  and at december  we anticipate rov operating income to increase in as a result of an increase in days on hire  with an increase in our fleet utilization to or more  from increased demand offshore west africa and in the us gulf of mexico 
we anticipate adding to vehicles in and retiring four to six  which should add to our days available and days on hire over our subsea products operating income for increased over on better umbilical plant throughput  higher installation and workover control system iwocs services  and growth in demand for our subsea hardware and tooling  partially due to our acquisition of nca in march our operating margin percentage was lower due to product mix  with umbilicals being a higher percentage of subsea products revenue in our subsea products operating income and margin percentage for increased over  due to manufacturing process improvements and cost reductions  improved umbilical plant throughput  and higher demand for subsea field development hardware  rov tooling rentals and iwocs services 
our operating income and margins were also adversely affected by million of unexpected costs we incurred in the third quarter on two blowout preventer control systems 
we anticipate our subsea products segment operating income in to be higher than in  as we expect increased tooling demand and throughput in our umbilical plants 
our subsea products backlog was million at december   about the same level it was at december  our subsea projects revenue and operating income declined from due to lower demand for our shallow water diving and deepwater vessel services in the us gulf of mexico 
in  we recorded a gain of million on the sale of the ocean legend  a mobile offshore production system 
our subsea projects revenue and operating income declined from due to lower demand for our services on hurricane damage related repair projects and our phased exit of the mobile offshore production systems business 
in  we recorded a million impairment charge to adjust the carrying value of our vessel  the performer  to its fair value less estimated costs to sell 
we completed the sale in for approximately the vessel s reduced carrying value 
we anticipate our operating income for subsea projects to be higher than in on an international expansion of our deepwater vessel capabilities to work for bp plc offshore angola  the addition of agr fo s operations in australia  and a gradual demand recovery in the us gulf of mexico 
our asset integrity revenue and operating income were higher in than in on higher service demand in europe and central asia 
our asset integrity segment operating income results in were similar to those in we expect that our asset integrity segment revenue and operating income will be higher in  primarily as a result of our acquisition of agr fo in december advanced technologies 
the table that follows sets out revenue and profitability for this segment 
year ended december  dollars in thousands revenue gross margin gross margin operating income operating income our advanced technologies segment operating income results in were similar to those in our advanced technologies segment s revenue and operating income were higher than due to higher levels of entertainment industry contracts  us navy engineering services and department of defense manufacturing projects 
we anticipate our advanced technologies operating income will be higher than that of due to higher levels of entertainment industry contracts and improved execution on us navy vessel service work 
unallocated expenses 
our unallocated expenses  ie  those not associated with a specific business segment  within gross margin consist of expenses related to our incentive and deferred compensation plans  including restricted stock and bonuses  as well as other general expenses

the table that follows sets forth our significant financial statement items below the operating income line 
year ended december  dollars in thousands interest income interest expense  net of amounts capitalized equity earnings of unconsolidated affiliates other income expense  net provision for income taxes interest expense decreased in and  primarily from lower interest rates on libor based borrowings under our revolving credit agreement and term loan  and lower debt levels 
we did not capitalize any interest in we capitalized million of interest in and less than million of interest in interest expense in included million to terminate an interest rate hedge 
we earn equity income from our investment in medusa spar llc 
medusa spar llc owns of a production spar in the us gulf of mexico and earns its revenue from fees charged on production processed through the facility 
throughput increased in over due to additional wells added to the spar 
throughput decreased in due to normal production declines 
we expect medusa spar llc revenue will decline in due to normal rates of well decline 
medusa spar llc s revenue could be increased if the operator of the producing wells receives regulatory approval to start producing from other zones in the existing wells  which are anticipated to have higher flow rates than the currently producing zones  or is able to connect more wells to the spar 
included in other income expenses  net are foreign currency transaction gains losses of million  million and million for  and  respectively 
in  we also earned a fee of million for serving as the stalking horse bidder in an asset auction proceeding 
our effective tax rate  including foreign  state and local taxes  was   and for  and  respectively  which included a combination of expiring statutes of limitations and the resolution of uncertain tax positions of million  million and million  respectively  related to certain tax liabilities we recorded in prior years 
the primary difference between our effective tax rate of and the federal statutory rate of reflects our intent to indefinitely reinvest in certain of our international operations 
therefore  we are no longer providing for us taxes on a portion of our foreign earnings 
the effective tax rate of in our financial statements for is a result of our effective rate of adjusted by million of additional tax benefits  primarily attributable to amending prior years us federal income tax returns to reflect a broader interpretation of our pre tax income eligible for certain deductions allowable for oil and gas construction activities  and tax effecting the million gain on the sale of the ocean legend at the us federal statutory rate of 
we anticipate our effective tax rate in will be approximately off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined by sec rules 

table of contents contractual obligations at december   we had payments due under contractual obligations as follows dollars in thousands payments due by period total after long term debt operating leases purchase obligations other long term obligations reflected on our balance sheet under gaap total in  we chartered a vessel and crew for three years with two one year options for our field operations contract in angola 
total charter hire will be million for the first three years 
at december   we had outstanding purchase order commitments totaling million  including approximately million for specialized steel tubes to be used in our manufacturing of steel tube umbilicals by our subsea products segment and million for rov winches 
we have ordered the specialized steel tubes in advance to meet expected sales commitments 
the winches have been ordered for new rovs and for anticipated replacements due to normal wear and tear 
should we decide not to accept delivery of the steel tubes  we would incur cancellation charges of at least of the amount canceled 
in  we entered into an agreement with our chairman the chairman who was also then our chief executive officer 
that agreement was amended in and in pursuant to the amended agreement  the chairman relinquished his position as chief executive officer in may and began his post employment service period on december   which continued through august   during which service period the chairman  acting as an independent contractor  agreed to serve as nonexecutive chairman of our board of directors 
the agreement provides the chairman with post employment benefits for ten years following august  the agreement also provides for medical coverage on an after tax basis to the chairman  his spouse and children for their lives 
we recognized the net present value of the post employment benefits over the expected service period 
our total accrued liabilities  current and long term  under this post employment benefit were million and million at december  and  respectively 
effects of inflation and changing prices our financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  using historical us dollar accounting  or historical cost 
statements based on historical cost  however  do not adequately reflect the cumulative effect of increasing costs and changes in the purchasing power of the dollar  especially during times of significant and continued inflation 
in order to minimize the negative impact of inflation on our operations  we attempt to cover the increased cost of anticipated changes in labor  material and service costs  either through an estimate of those changes  which we reflect in the original price  or through price escalation clauses in our contracts 
inflation has not had a material effect on our revenue or income from operations in the past three years  and no such effect is expected in the near future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are currently exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions we have entered into in the normal course of business 
these risks relate to interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
we do not believe these risks are material 
we have not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we currently have no outstanding hedges or similar instruments 
we typically manage our exposure to interest rate changes through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report for a description of our revolving credit facility and interest rates on our borrowings 
we believe significant interest rate changes would not have a material near term impact on our future earnings or cash flows 
because we operate in various oil and gas exploration and production regions in the world  we conduct a portion of our business in currencies other than the us dollar 
the functional currency for several of our international operations is the applicable local currency 
a stronger us dollar against the us pound sterling and the norwegian kroner would result in lower operating income 
we manage our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates principally through arranging compensation in us dollars or freely convertible currency and  to the extent possible  by limiting compensation received in 
table of contents other currencies to amounts necessary to meet obligations denominated in those currencies 
we use the exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date to translate assets and liabilities as to which the functional currency is the local currency  resulting in translation adjustments that we reflect as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in the shareholders equity section of our consolidated balance sheets 
we recorded adjustments of million  million and million to our equity accounts in  and  respectively 
negative adjustments reflect the net impact of the strengthening of the us dollar against various foreign currencies for locations where the functional currency is not the us dollar 
conversely  positive adjustments reflect the effect of a weakening dollar 
we recorded foreign currency transaction gains losses of million  million and million that are included in other income expense  net in our consolidated income statements in  and  respectively
