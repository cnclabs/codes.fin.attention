overview the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is intended to help the reader understand layne christensen company  our operations and our present business environment 
md a is provided as a supplement to and should be read in connection with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in item of this report 
md a includes the following sections our business a general description of our business and key fiscal events 
consolidated review of operations an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the three years presented in our consolidated financial statements 
operating segment review of operations an analysis of our results of operations for the three years presented in our consolidated financial statements for our reporting segments 
during fiscal  we changed our reporting segments in connection with the transition to new leadership  reporting relationships and our new one layne strategy 
we previously reported results of operations under three reporting segments including the water infrastructure division  mineral exploration division and energy division 
our new reporting segments are the water resources division  inliner division  heavy civil division  geoconstruction division  mineral exploration division and energy division 
reporting segment information and comparisons in the operating segment review of operations for prior periods have been recast to match the new reporting segment structure 
liquidity and capital resources an analysis of cash flows  aggregate financial commitments and certain financial condition ratios 
critical accounting policies a discussion of our critical accounting policies that involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity 
this section also includes the impact of new accounting standards 
our business layne is a global water management  construction and drilling company 
we provide responsible solutions for water  mineral and energy challenges 
the company s operational and organizational structure is divided into six divisions based on primary service lines 
each division is comprised of individual district offices  which primarily offer similar services and serve similar markets 
periodically  individual offices within a division may perform services that are normally provided by another division 
when that happens  the results of those services are recorded in the originating offices own division 
for example  if a mineral exploration division office performed water well drilling services  the revenues would be recorded in the mineral exploration division rather than the water resources division 
the company s segments are defined as follows water resources division our water resources division provides our customers with every aspect of water supply system development and technology  including hydrologic design and construction  source of supply exploration  well and intake construction and well and pump rehabilitation 
the division also brings new technologies to the water and wastewater markets and offers water treatment equipment engineering services  which supports the company s historic municipal business  providing systems for the treatment of regulated and nuisance contaminants  specifically  iron  manganese  hydrogen sulfide  arsenic  radium  nitrate  perchlorate  and volatile organic compounds 
the water resources division provides water systems and services in most regions of the us inliner division our inliner division provides a diverse range of wastewater pipeline and structure rehabilitation services to our clients 
we focus on our proprietary inliner cured in place pipe cipp which allows us to rehabilitate aging sanitary sewer  storm water and process water infrastructure to provide structural rebuilding as well as infiltration and inflow reduction 
our trenchless technology minimizes environmental impact and reduces or eliminates surface and social disruption 
we are somewhat unique in that the technology itself  the liner tube manufacturer and the largest installer of the inliner cipp technology are all housed within our family of companies 
while we focus on cipp efforts  we also provide a wide variety of other rehabilitative methods including janssen structural renewal for service lateral connections and mainlines  slip lining  traditional excavation and replacement  u liner high density polyethylene fold and form and a variety of products for structure rebuilding and coating 
heavy civil division our heavy civil division serves the needs of government agencies and industrial customers by overseeing the design and construction of water and wastewater treatment plants  as well as pipeline installation 
in addition  this division designs and builds integrated water supply and wastewater treatment facilities and provides filter media and membranes 
these solutions are also provided in connection with collector wells  surface water intakes  pumping stations and groundwater pump stations 
we also design and construct biogas facilities anaerobic digesters for the purpose of generating and capturing methane gas  an emerging renewable energy resource 
geoconstruction division our geoconstruction division provides specialized foundation construction services to the heavy civil  industrial and commercial construction markets that are focused primarily on soil stabilization and subterranean structural support during the construction of dams levees  tunnels  shafts  water lines  subways  highways and marine facilities 
services offered include jet grouting  structural diaphragm and slurry cutoff walls  cement and chemical grouting  drilled piles  vibratory ground improvement and installation of ground anchors 
mineral exploration division our mineral exploration division conducts primarily aboveground drilling activities  including all phases of core drilling  reverse circulation  dual tube  hammer and rotary air blast methods 
our service offerings include both exploratory and definitional drilling 
global mining companies hire us to extract samples from sites that the mining companies analyze for mineral content before investing heavily in development 
we help them determine if there is a minable mineral deposit on the site  assess whether it will be economical to mine and to assist in mapping the mine layout 
our primary markets are in the western us  mexico  australia  brazil and africa 
we also have ownership interests in foreign affiliates operating in latin america that form our primary presence in this market 
energy division our energy division focuses on the exploration and production of oil and gas properties  primarily concentrating on projects in the mid continent region of the united states 
other other includes small service companies and any other specialty operations not included in one of the other divisions 
key fiscal events during the fourth quarter of fiscal  in connection with our annual assessment of the carrying value of goodwill and other intangibles  we recorded impairment charges totaling  the charges included  associated with the water resources division   associated with the inliner division   associated with the heavy civil division   associated with the energy division and  associated with our other businesses 
the charges in the heavy civil division include  related to trade names  largely due to our corporate strategy decision in the fourth quarter to emphasize the layne name for all the company s services worldwide  which will result in our ceasing to use other trade names 
the remainder of the charges in the heavy civil division  and the charges in the other divisions  reflect the write off of substantially all of the goodwill associated with those divisions 
the write offs are a result of projected continued weakness in demand for construction projects that is greater and more persistent than originally anticipated  continuing projected weakness in the economy adversely affecting spending by government agencies and the resulting pressures on margins from increased competition 
the goodwill charge in water resources was also impacted by a shift in the corporate strategy in the fourth quarter to focus more on traditional water treatment services  resulting in the write off of goodwill associated with acquired companies that had a heavy research and development focus 
the tax effect of the impairment charges was  also during the fourth quarter  the company recorded a  liability related to its investigation into the fcpa 
see part i  items legal proceedings and a risk factors in this form k for additional information regarding our internal investigation of compliance with the fcpa 
on january   the company s chief executive officer ceo  andrew b 
schmitt  retired 
rene j 
robichaud  a board member and president  assumed the position of ceo as of january  in connection with mr 
schmitt s retirement  the company recognized  in retirement benefit costs during fiscal on august   the company appointed gernot penzhorn  who was vice president of operations for the mineral exploration division  to replace eric despain as president of the division 
in connection with mr 
despain s departure  the company recognized  in severance expenses during fiscal the company s heavy civil division experienced increased competition in the municipal bid market throughout the year 
additionally  several of the division s projects encountered delays and cost overruns due to adverse jobsite conditions and weather related project delays 
for fiscal  this division s revenues have decreased and pre tax earnings have decreased compared to fiscal the company experienced continued improvements in the minerals exploration markets served by our wholly owned operations and our latin america affiliates 
for fiscal  revenues in our mineral exploration division have increased and pre tax earnings have improved compared to fiscal the company recognized a gain of  inclusive of  amortization of deferred gain on the sale of a facility in fontana  california 
the facility was sold on march   in anticipation of relocating existing operations to a different property 
on february   the company acquired the kansas and colorado cured in place pipe operations of wildcat civil services  a sewer rehabilitation contractor 
wildcat will further the company s expansion and geographic reach of its inliner group westward

a further discussion of results of operations by division is presented below 
cost of revenues increased  or to  of revenues for fiscal  compared to  of revenues for fiscal the increase as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to cost overruns and project delays in our heavy civil business in the second half of the year and by margin pressures in our heavy civil and water resources businesses due to the continuing weakness in municipal spending 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal in the fourth quarter  we recorded a  liability related to the investigation into the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa 
the remaining increase was primarily due to additional expenses of  from acquired operations   in increased compensation costs  costs of  associated with the transition of the chief executive officer and other executives   in increased legal and professional fees and  in increased travel expenses 
the increases were partially offset by a decrease in consulting services of  due to higher costs in fiscal associated with systems implementation and merger and acquisition projects 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses were  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal the increase was primarily the result of increases in assets from acquisitions and property additions 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  in connection with our annual assessment of the carrying value of goodwill and other intangibles  we recorded impairment charges totaling  the charges included  associated with the water resources division   associated with the inliner division   associated with the heavy civil division   associated with the energy division and  associated with our other businesses 
the charges in the heavy civil division include  related to trade names  largely due our corporate strategy decision in the fourth quarter to emphasize the layne name for the company s services worldwide  which will result in our ceasing to use these trade names 
the remainder of the charges in the heavy civil division  and the charges in the other divisions  are to write off substantially all of the goodwill associated with those divisions 
the write offs are a result of projected continued weakness in demand for construction projects that is greater and more persistent than originally anticipated  continuing projected weakness in the economy adversely affecting spending by government agencies and the resulting pressures on margins from increased competition from smaller competitors 
the goodwill charge in water resources was also impacted by a shift in the corporate strategy in the fourth quarter to focus more on traditional water treatment services  resulting in the write off of goodwill associated with acquired companies that had a heavy research and development focus 
the tax effect of the impairment charges was a benefit of  equity in earnings of affiliates was  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal the increase reflects the impact of an improved minerals exploration market in latin america  primarily for gold and copper in chile and peru as well as a full year of operations from our geoconstruction affiliate in brazil 
interest expense increased to  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal the increase was the result of increased borrowing on our revolving credit facilities to fund operations 
other income  net for fiscal consisted primarily of a gain of  inclusive of  amortization of deferred gain on the sale of a facility in california  a gain of  on the sale of certain investment securities in australia and gains of  on the sale of other equipment 
the company recorded income tax expense of  on a loss before income taxes of  resulting in an effective rate of negative for fiscal  compared to expense of  an effective rate of for fiscal excluding the impact of the impairment charges  for fiscal  the company would have recorded income tax expense of  an adjusted effective rate of 
the adjusted effective rate for the current year was lower than the effective rate for the prior year due to the continued increase in the equity earnings of affiliates as a percentage of income before income taxes 
as a substantial part of the non dividend portion of these earnings is considered indefinitely re invested  it tends to lower our effective tax rate 
operating segment review of operations for purposes of comparison  the discussion below of division operating results excludes the impact of impairment charges which have been discussed above 
water resources division fiscal years ended january  in thousands revenues loss income before income taxes income before impairments and income taxes at our water resources division  revenue levels were up across all product lines  particularly water supply  repair and installation services and our deep wastewater injection well work for power companies in the florida market 
the increases were partially offset by a decline of  from our water supply project in afghanistan which was substantially completed early in the year 
income before impairments and income taxes included a gain of  including  amortization of deferred gain on the sale of a facility in fontana  california 
the decrease was primarily attributable to a decline of  from our afghanistan project which has not been fully replaced  lower margins on municipal bid work and by losses in our water treatment operations 
we expect profit margins for projects in the municipal sector to remain under pressure for at least the next year 
the backlog in the water resources division was  as of january   compared to  as of january  inliner division fiscal years ended january  in thousands revenues loss income before income taxes income before impairments and income taxes inliner division revenues increased primarily due to the impact of acquired operations  which contributed revenues of  the increase in income before impairments and income taxes was largely due to improved margins  particularly in the southeast us the acquired operations are being transitioned into the division and were not large contributors to earnings 
the backlog in the inliner division was  as of january   compared to  as of january  heavy civil division fiscal years ended january  in thousands revenues loss income before income taxes loss income before impairments and income taxes the decreases in heavy civil division revenues were due to slight revenue declines across most of our operations as the division encountered greater competition 
our expansion into the southwestern us continued  contributing revenues of  the decline in income before impairments and income taxes reflect the impact of extensive project delays and cost overruns  as well as margin pressures on municipal bid projects 
we have made operational and overhead changes to curtail the losses  including terminating certain project managers  reducing administrative staff and changing our bidding practices  but we expect low margins and bidding pressures to continue to hold earnings to near breakeven for calendar the backlog in the heavy civil division was  as of january   compared to  as of january  the decline is partially due to our efforts to increase our bid margins and reduce the levels of low margin projects 
geoconstruction division fiscal years ended january  in thousands revenues equity in earnings of affiliates income before income taxes revenues include a full year of operations for bencor  acquired at the end of the third quarter of fiscal revenue in our other operations was down  due in large part to time spent reallocating our resources following the completion of large projects in new orleans and san francisco 
income before income taxes was primarily attributable to an increase of  from acquired operations and to  increased equity earnings from our affiliates 
the backlog in the geoconstruction division was  as of january   compared to  as of january  mineral exploration division fiscal years ended january  in thousands revenues equity in earnings of affiliates income before income taxes mineral exploration revenues increased due to high activity levels across all locations  and were particularly strong in mexico  southern africa and the southwest us the increase in income before income taxes resulted primarily from a combination of high activity levels and continued improvement in pricing in substantially all of our operations  as well as equity earnings from our affiliates in latin america 
although they slowed in the fourth quarter due to project start up expenses and other delays at certain mine site locations  our partners had their strongest year ever  with significant increases at copper mine sites in chile 
the increases were partially offset by increased legal and professional expenses related to the fcpa investigation of  and by the accrual of  for the fcpa investigation in the fourth quarter 
energy division fiscal years ended january  in thousands revenues loss income before income taxes income before impairments and income taxes energy division revenues and earnings continue to be impacted by low natural gas prices  with average net sales price on production for fiscal of compared to per mcf for fiscal the net sales price excludes revenues generated from third party gas 
net gas production by the energy division for fiscal was  mmcf compared to  mmcf for fiscal we have offset the decline in prices to an extent by seeking to increase oil production and by reducing overhead expenses 
we expect natural gas prices to remain low and are currently exploring strategic alternatives for the energy division 
we will exploit opportunities within our current operating leases  like shallow oil  and continue to operate responsibly and efficiently 
other fiscal years ended january  in thousands revenues loss before income taxes loss before impairments and income taxes other revenues increased primarily as a result of increased revenues of  from our energy services operations 
the increase in loss before impairments and income taxes resulted primarily from acquisition integration related costs 
unallocated corporate expenses corporate expenses not allocated to individual divisions  primarily included in selling  general and administrative expenses  were  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal current year expenses include  related to the transition of the chief executive officer and other executives 
the remaining decrease from last year includes reductions of  in consulting costs for systems implementation and merger and acquisition projects  and  in incentive compensation expenses 
comparison of fiscal to fiscal revenues increased  or to  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal a further discussion of results of operations by division is presented below 
cost of revenues increased  or to  of revenues for fiscal  compared to  of revenues for fiscal the increase as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to margin pressures in our heavy civil and energy businesses  partially offset by higher margins in mineral exploration  on our work in afghanistan and on certain soil stabilization projects 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal the increase was primarily the result of increased incentive compensation expenses of   in added expenses from acquired operations  an increase in consulting expenses of  primarily related to systems implementation and merger and acquisition projects  and an increase in other compensation costs of  these increases were partially offset by a decrease as the prior year included  of settlement charges recorded for the elimination of our hourly pension plan liabilities 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses were  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal the decrease was primarily due to  lower depletion in the energy division as a result of updated estimates of economically recoverable gas reserves  partially offset by higher depreciation in the water infrastructure division from acquired assets and ongoing capital expenditures 
in fiscal  the company recorded a non cash impairment of oil and gas properties of  or  after income taxes  primarily as a result of a significant continued decline in natural gas prices and the expiration of higher priced forward sales contracts 
there were no such impairments recorded in fiscal during fiscal  the company received litigation settlements valued at  the settlements included receipt of land and buildings valued at  and cash receipts of  net of contingent attorney fees 
there were no litigation settlement gains in fiscal equity in earnings of affiliates was  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal the increase reflects the impact of an improved minerals exploration market in latin america  primarily for gold and copper in chile and peru 
interest expense decreased to  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal the decrease was a result of scheduled debt reductions 
income tax expense of  an effective rate of was recorded for fiscal  compared to income tax expense of  an effective rate of for fiscal  including an  benefit related to the non cash impairment charge of proved oil and gas properties recorded as a discrete item in the three months ended july  excluding the impairment and related tax benefit  the company would have recorded income tax expense of  an adjusted effective rate of for fiscal the effective rate for fiscal was lower than the adjusted rate for last year due to the reduced impact of non deductible expenses and the tax treatment of certain foreign operations 
as earnings increase  these factors will have a reduced impact on the effective rate since they are relatively fixed 
operating segment review of operations water resources division fiscal years ended january  in thousands revenues income before income taxes water resources division revenues increased primarily due to an increase in revenue of  from our water supply project in afghanistan and increases in revenue from our water supply operations concentrated in the central and northeast us the increases were partially offset by decreased revenues from water supply operations in the southeast us  the result of lower activity levels 
income before income taxes for the water resources division increased primarily due to increased earnings of  from our water supply project in afghanistan and improved results from water supply operations in the central and northeast us the increases were partially offset by decreased earnings from water supply operations in the southeast us  the result of lower activity levels 
the backlog in the water resources division was  as of january   compared to  as of january  inliner division fiscal years ended january  in thousands revenues income before income taxes inliner division revenues increased primarily due to increased revenues from our operations in the northeast  southeast and east coast us regions of   and  respectively 
the increases were the result of higher activity levels 
income before income taxes for the inliner division increased primarily due to improved results from our operations in the northeast  southeast and east coast us regions of   and  respectively 
the backlog in the inliner division was  as of january   compared to  as of january  heavy civil division fiscal years ended january  in thousands revenues income before income taxes heavy civil division revenues increased primarily due to increased revenue of  from our water plant construction operations  partially offset by decreased revenue of  from our utility pipeline construction businesses 
the reduction in the utility pipeline construction revenue was primarily due to a large utility contract in colorado that was substantially completed in fiscal income before income taxes for the heavy civil division decreased due to downward pressure on margins for municipal bid projects and a large utility contract in colorado that was substantially completed in fiscal the backlog in the heavy civil division was  as of january   compared to  as of january  geoconstruction division fiscal years ended january  in thousands revenues equity in earnings of affiliates income before income taxes geoconstruction division revenues increased primarily due to additional revenues of  from acquired operations 
income before income taxes for the geoconstruction division increased to  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal the increase was primarily attributable  from acquired operations  partially offset by a decrease in earnings from our non acquisition related projects  the result of lower activity levels 
the backlog in the geoconstruction division was  as of january   compared to  as of january  mineral exploration division fiscal years ended january  in thousands revenues equity in earnings of affiliates income before income taxes mineral exploration revenues increased driven by increased activity levels across all locations  the largest of which were in africa  the western us and mexico 
income before income taxes for the mineral exploration division increased primarily from improved margins  combined with higher revenues 
equity earnings from our affiliates  reduced earlier in fiscal by a customer driven project delay  improved in the last half of the year as the projects were caught up  increasing  for the year 
during fiscal  the company received a litigation settlement in australia of  earnings were offset by an increase of  in incentive compensation and by costs incurred in connection with our internal fcpa investigation 
energy division fiscal years ended january  in thousands revenues income loss before income taxes income loss before impairments and income taxes energy revenues decreased primarily due to lower natural gas prices and the expiration of favorably priced forward sales contracts in the first quarter of fiscal during fiscal  the company recorded a non cash impairment charge of  or  after income tax  for the carrying value of the assets in excess of future net cash flows 
also  during fiscal  we recorded settlement gains  net of attorney fees  of  related to litigation against former officers of a subsidiary and associated energy production companies 
the remaining decrease in income before income taxes for fiscal of  was due to the impact on revenues from lower natural gas prices and the expiration of forward sales contracts as noted above  partially offset by depletion decreasing  for fiscal  net gas production was  mmcf compared to  mmcf for fiscal the average net sales price per mcf on production for fiscal was compared to for fiscal the net sales price excludes revenues generated from third party gas 
other fiscal years ended january  in thousands revenues loss income before income taxes other revenues increased primarily as a result of revenues of  from energy services operations 
the decrease in income before income tax resulted primarily from acquisition integration related costs 
unallocated corporate expenses corporate expenses not allocated to individual divisions  primarily included in selling  general and administrative expenses  were  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal the increase was primarily due to an increase in incentive compensation of  based on increased earnings and an increase in consulting fees of  related to systems implementation and merger and acquisition projects 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction of  in settlement charges recorded in fiscal for the elimination of our hourly pension plan liabilities 
fluctuation in quarterly results the company historically has experienced fluctuations in its quarterly results arising from the timing of the award and completion of contracts  the recording of related revenues and unanticipated additional costs incurred on projects 
the company s revenues on large  long term contracts are recognized on a percentage of completion basis for individual contracts based upon the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs at completion 
contract price and cost estimates are reviewed periodically as work progresses and adjustments proportionate to the percentage of completion are reflected in contract revenues and gross profit in the reporting period when such estimates are revised 
changes in job performance  job conditions and estimated profitability including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
a significant number of the company s contracts contain fixed prices and assign responsibility to the company for cost overruns for the subject projects  as a result  revenues and gross margin may vary from those originally estimated and  depending upon the size of the project  variations from estimated contract performance could affect the company s operating results for a particular quarter 
many of the company s contracts are also subject to cancellation by the customer upon short notice with limited or no damages payable to the company 
in addition  adverse weather conditions  natural disasters  force majeure and other similar events can curtail company operations in various regions of the world throughout the year  resulting in performance delays and increased costs 
moreover  the company s domestic drilling and construction activities and related revenues and earnings tend to decrease in the winter months when adverse weather conditions interfere with access to project sites  as a result  the company s revenues and earnings in its second and third quarters tend to be higher than revenues and earnings in its first and fourth quarters 
accordingly  as a result of the foregoing as well as other factors  quarterly results should not be considered indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any full fiscal year 
see the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
inflation management does not believe that the company s operations for the periods discussed have been significantly adversely affected by inflation or changing prices from its suppliers 
liquidity and capital resources management exercises discretion regarding the liquidity and capital resource needs of its reportable segments 
this includes the ability to prioritize the use of capital and debt capacity  to determine cash management policies and to make decisions regarding capital expenditures 
the company s primary source of liquidity has historically been cash from operations  supplemented by borrowings under its credit facilities 
the company s working capital as of january  and was  and  respectively 
the company s cash and cash equivalents as of january  were  compared to  as of january  of these amounts  cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries as of january  were  compared to  as of january  the company believes that it will have sufficient cash from operations and access to credit facilities to meet its operating cash requirements  make required debt payments  and fund its capital expenditures 
funding for potential acquisitions will be evaluated based on the particular facts and circumstances of the opportunity 
on july   the company entered into a new private shelf agreement the shelf agreement whereby it can issue  in unsecured notes 
the  private shelf agreement extends to july   and replaced the company s prior master shelf agreement 
at january   the company had no notes outstanding 
the company also maintains an unsecured  revolving credit facility the new credit agreement which extends to march  at january   the company had letters of credit of  and borrowings of  outstanding under the new credit agreement resulting in available capacity of  the company s shelf agreement and new credit agreement each contain certain covenants including restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens  investments  acquisitions  transfer or sale of assets  transactions with affiliates and payment of dividends 
these provisions generally allow such activity to occur  subject to specific limitations and continued compliance with financial maintenance covenants 
significant financial maintenance covenants are a fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum leverage 
covenant levels and definitions are consistent between the shelf agreement and the new credit agreement 
the company was in compliance with its covenants as of january   and expects to remain in compliance through the term of the agreements 
the noncash impairment charges recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal did not have a significant effect on the company s covenants 
the financial covenants are based on defined terms included in the agreements  such as adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitdar 
compliance with the financial covenants is required on a quarterly basis  using the most recent four fiscal quarters 
adjusted ebitda is generally defined as consolidated net income excluding net interest expense  provision for income taxes  gains or losses from extraordinary items  gains or losses from the sale of capital assets  non cash items including depreciation and amortization  and share based compensation 
equity in earnings of affiliates is included only to the extent of dividends or distributions received 
adjusted ebitdar is defined as adjusted editda  plus rent expense 
all of these measures are considered non gaap financial measures and are not intended to be in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the company s minimum fixed charge coverage ratio covenant is the ratio of adjusted ebitdar to the sum of fixed charges 
fixed charges consist of rent expense  interest expense  and principal payments of long term debt 
the company s leverage ratio covenant is the ratio of total funded indebtedness to adjusted ebitda 
total funded indebtedness generally consists of outstanding debt  capital leases  unfunded pension liabilities  asset retirement obligations and escrow liabilities 
the threshold is adjusted over time based on a percentage of net income and the proceeds from the issuance of equity securities 
as of january  and  the company s actual and required covenant levels under the existing agreements were as follows actual required actual required in thousands  except for ratio data minimum fixed charge coverage ratio maximum leverage ratio operating activities cash provided by operating activities was   and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
the decline in operating cash flows in was primarily due to two factors  a decline in cash generated from earnings and increased working capital 
working capital  excluding debt  increased to  at january   from  at january  the decline in earnings was due to margin pressures and increased selling  general and administrative charges as discussed in the comparison of fiscal to fiscal above 
the working capital increase is due partially to increased revenue  but primarily to decreased billing and collection efficiency in our water resources and heavy civil divisions  partially offset by increased levels of accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
our billing and collection efficiency has been impacted by negotiated contract terms on several of our larger contracts which have extended milestones before billings may be submitted 
we have not had  and do not expect  significant unfavorable impacts on our ultimate collectability of our contractual amounts 
investing activities the company s capital expenditures of  for fiscal were split between  to maintain and upgrade its equipment and facilities and  toward the company s unconventional natural gas exploration and production 
this compares to equipment spending of  and natural gas exploration and production spending of  for fiscal the equipment and facilities spending in fiscal included  to purchase and prepare our new facility in california  completion of second rig for the florida injection well market and purchase of rigs to support geoconstruction projects 
spending for the company s unconventional gas operations was increased in fiscal to maintain our natural gas production level 
for fiscal  the company received  in proceeds from disposals of property and equipment of which  was for the sale of our facility in  california and the remainder for the sale of rigs and various other equipment categories 
this compares to proceeds received from disposal of property and equipment of  for fiscal for fiscal  the company invested  net of cash acquired for the acquisition of wildcat 
this compares to acquisition related spending of  for fiscal the company intends to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities to enhance its existing service offerings and to expand our geographic market 
the company s capital expenditures of  for fiscal were split between  to maintain and upgrade its equipment and facilities and  toward the company s unconventional natural gas exploration and production 
this compares to equipment spending of  and natural gas exploration and production spending of  for fiscal the increase in equipment and facilities spending was due to equipment purchased to support the company s expansion into the injection well market in florida and facilities expansion in the southwest us to support our water treatment product capabilities 
spending for the company s unconventional gas operations was reduced in fiscal as we scaled back production in reaction to lower gas prices available in our market 
for fiscal  the company invested  for acquired businesses  net of cash acquired  including  for a interest in diberil   for bencor   for intevras and  for cash purchase price adjustments for prior year acquisitions 
these investments were offset in part by the sale of layne geobrazil  a wholly owned subsidiary  for a cash payment of  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements

interest is payable on the credit agreement at variable interest rates equal to  at the company s option  a libor rate plus to  or a base rate  as defined in the credit agreement plus up to  each depending on the company s leverage ratio 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements interest payments on the credit agreement are uncertain due to variable interest rates and fluctuations in the outstanding balance  and accordingly have not been included in the table above 
the company has income tax uncertainties in the amount of  at january   that are classified as non current on the company s balance sheet as resolution of these matters is expected to take more than a year 
the ultimate timing of resolution of these items is uncertain  and accordingly the amounts have not been included in the table above 
the company incurs additional obligations in the ordinary course of operations 
these obligations  including but not limited to income tax payments  are expected to be met in the normal course of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  which are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  located in item of this form k 
we believe that the following represent our more critical estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  although not all inclusive 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized on large  long term construction contracts meeting the criteria of accounting standards codification asc topic construction type and production type contracts asc topic  using the percentage of completion method based upon the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs at completion 
contract price and cost estimates are reviewed periodically as work progresses and adjustments proportionate to the percentage of completion are reflected in contract revenues in the reporting period when such estimates are revised 
changes in job performance  job conditions and estimated profitability  including those arising from contract penalty provisions  change orders and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
as allowed by asc topic  revenue is recognized on smaller  short term construction contracts using the completed contract method 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted construction contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
revenues for direct sales of equipment and other ancillary products not provided in conjunction with the performance of construction contracts are recognized at the date of delivery to  and acceptance by  the customer 
provisions for estimated warranty obligations are made in the period in which the sales occur 
contracts for the company s mineral exploration drilling services are billable based on the quantity of drilling performed 
thus  revenues for these drilling contracts are recognized on the basis of actual footage or meterage drilled 
revenues for the sale of oil and gas by the company s energy division are recognized on the basis of volumes sold at the time of delivery to an end user or an interstate pipeline  net of amounts attributable to royalty or working interest holders 
the company s revenues are presented net of taxes imposed on revenue producing transactions with its customers  such as  but not limited to  sales  use  value added and some excise taxes 
oil and gas properties and mineral interests the company follows the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties 
under this method  all productive and nonproductive costs incurred in connection with the exploration for and development of oil and gas reserves are capitalized 
such capitalized costs include lease acquisition  geological and geophysical work  delay rentals  drilling  completing and equipping oil and gas wells  salaries  benefits and other internal salary related costs directly attributable to these activities 
costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred 
normal dispositions of oil and gas properties are accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs  with no gain or loss recognized 
capitalized costs are depleted based on units of production 
the company is required to review the carrying value of its oil and gas properties under the full cost accounting rules of the sec the ceiling test 
the ceiling limitation is the estimated after tax future net revenues from proved oil and gas properties discounted at  plus the cost of properties not subject to amortization 
if the net book value of our oil and gas properties  less related deferred income taxes  is in excess of the calculated ceiling  the excess must be written off as an expense 
application of the ceiling test requires pricing future revenues at the unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for each month within the month period prior to the end of reporting period  unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements such as fixed price physical delivery forward sales contracts 
unproved oil and gas properties are not amortized  but are assessed for impairment either individually or on an aggregated basis using a comparison of the carrying values of the unproved properties to net future cash flows 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impairment recorded in fiscal reserve estimates the company s estimates of oil and natural gas reserves  by necessity  are projections based on geologic and engineering data  and there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of such data as well as the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that are difficult to measure 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies and assumptions governing oil and natural gas prices  future operating costs  severance  ad valorem and excise taxes  development costs and workover and remedial costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of oil and gas attributable to any particular group of properties  classifications of such reserves based on risk of recovery  and estimates of the future net cash flows expected therefrom may vary substantially 
any significant variance in the assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of the reserves  which could affect the carrying value of the company s oil and gas properties and the rate of depletion of the oil and gas properties 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to the company s reserves will likely vary from estimates  and such variances may be material 
goodwill the company s impairment evaluation for goodwill is conducted annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired 
the evaluation for impairment is conducted at the reporting unit level 
the company s reporting units are the same as its operating segments 
the evaluation is performed by using a two step process 
in the first step  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit  including goodwill 
the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is generally determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit  then a second step must be completed in order to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment that should be recorded 
in the second step  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill including any unrecognized intangible assets in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill that results from the application of this second step is then compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference 
the assumptions used in the estimates of fair value for the first step are generally consistent with the past performance of each reporting unit and are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in current operating plans 
the more significant assumptions  which are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions  are as follows anticipated future cash flows and long term growth rates for each reporting unit 
the income approach to determining fair value relies on the timing and estimates of future cash flows  including an estimate of long term growth rates 
the projections use management s estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period including growth rates in sales and estimates of expected changes in operating margins 
the company s projections of future cash flows are subject to change as actual results are achieved that differ from those anticipated 
actual results could vary significantly from estimates 
selection of an appropriate discount rate 
the income approach requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate  which is based on a weighted average cost of capital analysis 
the discount rate is subject to changes in short term interest rates and long term yield as well as variances in the typical capital structure of marketplace participants in our industry 
the discount rate is determined based on assumptions that would be used by marketplace participants  and for that reason  the capital structure of selected marketplace participants was used in the weighted average cost of capital analysis 
given the current volatile economic conditions  it is possible that the discount rate could change 
a change in events or circumstances  a change in strategic direction  or a change in the competitive or economic environment could adversely affect the fair value of one or more reporting units 
if additional goodwill or other intangibles on the consolidated balance sheet become impaired during a future period  the resulting impairment charge could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
the company s goodwill totaled  as of january  of this amount   is recorded within the geoconstruction reporting unit and  is recorded within the inliner reporting unit 
the fair value of the geoconstruction reporting unit substantially exceeds its carrying value 
a decrease in the fair value of the inliner reporting unit  holding all other variables constant  could result in incremental goodwill impairment up to  the company s intangible assets book value  net of amortization  was  as of january  other long lived assets long lived assets  including amortizable intangible assets and the company s gas transportation facilities and equipment  are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the following significant underperformance of our assets  significant changes in the use of the assets  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
accrued insurance expense the company maintains insurance programs where it is responsible for a certain amount of each claim up to a retention limit 
estimates are recorded for health and welfare  property and casualty insurance costs that are associated with these programs 
these costs are estimated based on actuarially determined projections of future payments under these programs 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was anticipated  reserves recorded may not be sufficient and additional costs could be required 
costs estimated to be incurred in the future for employee health and welfare benefits  property  workers compensation and casualty insurance programs resulting from claims which have occurred are accrued currently 
under the terms of the company s agreement with the various insurance carriers administering these claims  the company is not required to remit the total premium until the claims are actually paid by the insurance companies 
these costs are not expected to significantly impact liquidity in future periods 
income taxes income taxes are provided using the asset liability method  in which deferred taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of existing assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are reviewed for recoverability and valuation allowances are provided as necessary 
provision for us income taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates is made only on those amounts in excess of funds considered to be invested indefinitely 
the company s estimate of uncertainty in income taxes is based on the framework established in the accounting for income taxes guidance 
this guidance addresses the determination of how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
the company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
for tax positions that meet this recognition threshold  the company applies judgment  taking into account applicable tax laws and experience in managing tax audits and relevant accounting guidance  to determine the amount of tax benefits to recognize in the financial statements 
for each uncertain position  the difference between the benefit realized on our tax return and the benefit reflected in the financial statements is recorded as a liability in the consolidated balance sheet 
this liability is updated at each financial statement date to reflect the impacts of audit settlements and other resolution of audit issues  expiration of statutes of limitation  developments in tax law and ongoing discussions with taxing authorities 
litigation and other contingencies the company is involved in litigation incidental to its business  the disposition of which is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company s assumptions related to these proceedings 
in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  we record a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
these provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations  settlements  rulings  advice of legal counsel  and other information and events pertaining to a particular case 
to the extent additional information arises or the company s strategies change  it is possible that the company s estimate of its probable liability in these matters may change

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks to which the company is exposed are interest rate risk on variable rate debt  foreign exchange rate risk that could give rise to translation and transaction gains and losses and fluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas 
interest rate risk the company centrally manages its debt portfolio considering overall financing strategies and tax consequences 
a description of the company s debt is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
as of january  an instantaneous change in interest rates of one percentage point would impact the company s annual interest expense by approximately  foreign currency risk operating in international markets involves exposure to possible volatile movements in currency exchange rates 
currently  the company s primary international operations are in australia  africa  mexico  canada  brazil and italy 
the operations are described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s affiliates also operate in south america and mexico see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the majority of the company s contracts in africa and mexico are us dollar based  providing a natural reduction in exposure to currency fluctuations 
the company also may utilize various hedge instruments  primarily foreign currency option contracts  to manage the exposures associated with fluctuating currency exchange rates see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of january   the company did not have any outstanding foreign currency option contracts 
as currency exchange rates change  translation of the income statements of the company s international operations into us dollars may affect year to year comparability of operating results 
we estimate that a change in foreign exchange rates would impact income before income taxes by approximately   and  for the years ended january   and  respectively 
this represents approximately of the income before income taxes of international businesses after adjusting for primarily us dollar based operations 
this quantitative measure has inherent limitations  as it does not take into account any governmental actions  changes in customer purchasing patterns or changes in the company s financing and operating strategies 
foreign exchange gains and losses in the company s consolidated results of operations reflect transaction gains and losses and translation gains and losses from the company s mexican and african operations which use the us dollar as their functional currency 
net foreign exchange losses for the years ended january   and  were   and  respectively 
commodity price risk the company is exposed to fluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas  which impact the sale of the energy division s oil and unconventional gas production 
the prices of oil and natural gas are volatile and the company may enter into fixed price physical contracts  if available at attractive prices  to cover a portion of its production to manage price fluctuations and to achieve a more predictable cash flow 
as of january   the company did not have any of these contracts in place due to continued low prices in the forward sales markets 
the company intends to continue monitoring forward sales prices and will reevaluate its forward sales commitments accordingly over the course of fiscal the company estimates that a change in the prices of oil and natural gas would have impacted income before taxes by approximately  for the year ended january   based on the company s production which was sold on a spot market basis during the year 
this measure is exclusive of any potential impact on its impairment computation
