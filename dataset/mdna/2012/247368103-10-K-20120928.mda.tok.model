item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business outlook while we are pleased that delta apparel  inc was able to deliver yet another record sales year and take important steps to position ourselves for continued growth in the future  we were disappointed with the amount of demand destruction that took place in the marketplace as selling prices at retail reflected the higher cotton costs incurred by the company in fiscal this hurt our delta catalog business as customers de stocked in anticipation of lower prices in the future 
our soffe business also felt the impact  as replenishment orders from department stores were lower than anticipated as these retailers saw significant drops in same store sales 
as cotton prices have stabilized to some degree and inventories in the marketplace level out  we anticipate renewed growth and stronger margins in both of these businesses in fiscal year we have initiated strategies and are evaluating other aggressive plans to better leverage our businesses and accelerate growth 
during fiscal year  we completed the initiative of getting all our branded businesses on the same enterprise resource planning erp system 
we are already seeing improved service efficiencies from these conversions in apparel ordering  warehousing and distribution processes and expect to benefit from lower expenses going forward 
we expect to continue further erp initiatives to streamline our processes and add a strong business to business platform for our soffe customers 
in fiscal year  we began moving our funtees private label business onto our existing software platform used in the delta catalog business  and expect to complete the conversion in the first half of fiscal year this consolidation will allow us to better manage our inventory flow and gain further synergies that should improve our operating margins 
we expensed  as a component of cost of goods sales  million dollars in the second half of the fiscal year to balance manufacturing capacity with demand  although our unit sales of undecorated tees were up eight percent from the fourth quarter of the prior year and unit sales at funtees were up over ten percent from the prior year 
these curtailments allowed us to reduce our inventories in an orderly manner  free up excess working capital  reduce our commitment to higher cost cotton and better position ourselves to meet our objectives for fiscal year we also are in the process of moving several functions of our private label business to our el salvador facility to better serve customers through an enhanced and efficient product development process 
concurrently  we are further modernizing our decoration equipment  with the objective of expanding capabilities and lowering production costs 
we believe the costs of these initiatives  much of which was recognized in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year  will be more than offset by the long term benefits and efficiencies that will begin to accrue in fiscal year despite the challenges of fiscal year  we saw good improvement in several of our businesses 
the game  driven by our salt life business and improved shipments of motorsports related products  recorded strong sales growth and improved profitability 
junkfood also turned in excellent performance and achieved record revenue driven primarily from strong branding activities and continued growth in sports license products 
the art gun business also achieved excellent gains  tripling net sales for the year with vastly improved margins both in the fourth quarter and full year 
funtees also made great strides during fiscal  achieving record sales and operating profits for the year 
looking ahead to  we believe cotton prices have stabilized somewhat and there should be an abundant world supply of cotton over the next year 
therefore  we are remaining short on future cotton commitments in order to keep the company in the most flexible position regarding future raw material costs 
while demand was tepid during our fourth quarter of fiscal  we have seen solid demand for most of our products as we begin fiscal year  and expect to achieve record revenue in fiscal year despite comparing against the higher selling prices from the prior year that were driven from the cotton cost 
our inventories are well balanced and we are making continued progress on our commitment to improve service levels across the many markets we serve 
while we are still operating our manufacturing facilities at less than full capacity  we made further efficiency gains over the past year which should improve operating margins as we progress through the next several quarters 
we also anticipate margin improvement as we gain traction with our strategies to leverage our creative talent and retail relationships across our various operating units 
we plan to spend about million for capital improvements in fiscal year  most of which will focus on screen print modernization and expansion in both our international and us facilities  branding and point of sale displays for branded products 
our objective for is to achieve organic growth in all of our business units and we believe we are well positioned to do so 
our product development  merchandising and marketing efforts  combined with our diverse customer base across many channels of distribution  will be the catalyst that should help us achieve this goal and drive us toward our tenth consecutive year of record revenue 
earnings guidance we remain optimistic in our outlook for fiscal year  while recognizing there are many unknowns that are outside of our control that could influence our results 
for the fiscal year ending june   we believe we will again achieve record revenues in the range of to million  an increase of to from fiscal year  all of which is expected to be organic growth 
earnings are expected to be in the range of to per diluted share in fiscal year we are currently seeing continued improvements in our fiscal 
table of contents year first quarter over the comparable period  and anticipate single digit net sales growth accompanied by a modest operating profit increase prior to factoring the cost of the audit committee investigation referenced in part i  item  legal proceedings 
results of operations overview fiscal year marked another year of growth for delta apparel  inc and our ninth consecutive year of record revenue 
we faced significant headwinds as we started the year  including higher energy and transportation costs  a very weak and sluggish economy and  most challenging  extreme volatility in the price of cotton 
although net sales increases and expanded market share in several of our divisions enabled us to maintain our record of revenue growth  they were not enough to entirely offset the negative effect these conditions had on our bottom line 
higher selling prices  coupled with continued marketing initiatives to gain new customers and expand business relationships with existing customers  drove organic sales growth of during fiscal year on top of the organic growth achieved in fiscal year the organic sales growth resulted in record sales of million  an increase of million  or  from the prior year 
during fiscal year  our profitability was diminished by high cost cotton and other unusual costs associated with the transition of our product development functions that we voluntarily incurred to better position ourselves for the future 
operating profit decreased million to million  or of sales  in fiscal year  resulting in net loss of million  or loss per diluted share 
quarterly financial data for information regarding quarterly financial data  refer to note quarterly financial information unaudited to the consolidated financial statements  which information is incorporated herein by reference 
fiscal year versus fiscal year net sales for fiscal year were million  a million  or  increase from the prior year sales of million  all of which was organic sales growth 
both the basics and branded segments contributed to the increase  with an increase in our basics segment and a increase in our branded segment 
sales in the branded segment were million  or approximately of total sales 
junk food apparel and the growth of the salt life collection contributed to the increased sales  which was partially offset by lower sales of soffe merchandise 
sales within the basics segment increased to million  or of our total revenue 
the organic growth in the basics segment was driven by a increase in average selling prices  partially offset by a decline in units sold 
gross margins declined basis points to of net sales in fiscal year from of net sales in the prior year 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales was driven primarily from the impact of higher raw material prices in both the branded and basics segment 
the decrease in margins for the year was accelerated in the second fiscal quarter when we took a million inventory markdown in the basics segment  an action taken to account for the negative effect that cotton prices were having on our industry 
our gross margins may not be comparable to other companies  since some companies include costs related to their distribution network in cost of goods sold and we exclude them from gross profit and include them in selling  general and administrative expenses 
fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales  in the prior year 
the decline in selling  general and administrative expenses is primarily from a decrease in performance based compensation expense resulting from the decline in earnings during fiscal year compared to the prior year 
in addition  fiscal year included costs associated with the acquisition of the cotton exchange  as well as some brand marketing campaigns that were not repeated in fiscal year fiscal year resulted in an operating loss of million  or of sales  in fiscal year  compared to million  or of sales  in fiscal year resulting from the factors described above 
operating income in the branded and basics segments were million and million  respectively 
net interest expense for fiscal year was million  an increase of million  or  from million for fiscal year the increase in net interest expense was primarily due to higher debt levels resulting from the additional working capital requirements from the higher raw material costs 
in addition  average interest rates rose approximately basis points  further increasing interest expense in fiscal year our fiscal year effective income tax rate was compared to an effective tax rate of in fiscal year the tax rate was impacted by the operating losses driven by the inventory markdown during the year  lowering our us taxable income while maintaining profits in the offshore taxable and tax free jurisdictions fiscal year had a net loss of million  a million decrease from net income of million in fiscal year 
table of contents fiscal year versus fiscal year net sales for fiscal year were million  a million increase from the prior year sales of million 
the sales increase resulted from organic sales growth of and the additional revenue from the acquisition of the cotton exchange 
both segments contributed to the increase with an increase in our basics segment and a increase in our branded segment 
sales in the branded segment were million  or approximately of total sales 
revenue from the cotton exchange  which we acquired in july  drove a increase in the branded segment revenue from the prior year 
soffe apparel and the new salt life collection also contributed to the growth  which was partially offset by lower sales of junk food merchandise 
sales within the basics segment increased to million  or of our total revenue 
the organic growth in the basics segment was driven by a increase in average selling prices  partially offset by a decline in units sold 
gross margins improved basis points to of net sales in fiscal year from of net sales in the prior year 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was driven primarily from higher average selling prices within our basics segment combined with efficiencies gained from our vertical manufacturing platform 
during fiscal year  we increased capacity and operated our manufacturing facilities full throughout the entire year 
we gained efficiencies  improved quality and lowered costs in manufacturing through our continuous improvement initiatives and leveraging of fixed costs with the additional production capacity added during the year 
the improved gross margins in our basics segment were partially offset by a decline in our branded segment margins due to lower sales of our vintage licensed products and higher operational expenses associated with salt life and the digital printing business 
our gross margins may not be comparable to other companies  since some companies include costs related to their distribution network in cost of goods sold and we exclude them from gross profit and include them in selling  general and administrative expenses 
fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales  in the prior year 
selling expenses increased as a percentage of sales primarily because we made investments in consumer brand marketing campaigns to promote future growth of our branded products 
general and administrative expenses also increased as a percentage of sales with costs associated with the acquisition of the cotton exchange  expenses related to art gun and higher performance based compensation expense associated with our improved operating results and stock price 
our operating profit was million  or of sales  in fiscal year  compared to million  or of sales  in fiscal year resulting from the factors described above 
operating income in the branded and basics segments were million and million  respectively 
in fiscal year  the branded segment operating income included a non cash net favorable adjustment of million related to the valuation of the art gun contingent consideration and goodwill 
net interest expense for fiscal year was million  a reduction of million  or  from million for fiscal year the decrease in net interest expense was primarily due to lower average interest rates in fiscal year resulting from the expiration of interest rate swap and collar agreements in march our fiscal year effective income tax rate was compared to an effective tax rate of in fiscal year the decrease is due to having a higher percentage of pre tax earnings in foreign tax free locations compared to earnings in the united states and foreign taxable locations 
during fiscal year  we further developed our tax planning strategies  allowing us to keep more profits in honduras  a tax free zone  reducing our overall effective tax rate 
net income for fiscal year was million  a million increase from net income of million in fiscal year liquidity and capital resources credit facility and other financial obligations on may   delta apparel  soffe  junkfood  to the game and art gun entered into a fourth amended and restated loan and security agreement the amended loan agreement with the financial institutions named in the amended loan agreement as lenders  wells fargo bank  national association  as administrative agent  bank of america  na  as syndication agent  wells fargo capital finance  llc  as sole lead arranger  and wells fargo capital finance  llc and merrill lynch  pierce  fenner smith incorporated  as joint bookrunners 
in connection with the amended loan agreement  israel discount bank of new york was removed from the syndicate of lenders under the credit facility  and bank of america  na was added to the syndicate of lenders 
pursuant to the amended loan agreement  the maturity of the loans under the previously existing credit facility was extended to may  and the line of credit was increased to million subject to borrowing base limitations  which represents an increase of million in the amount that was previously available under the credit facility 
under the amended loan agreement  provided that no event of default exists  we have the option to increase the maximum credit available under the facility to million subject to borrowing base limitations  conditioned upon the agent s ability to secure additional commitments and customary closing conditions 
at june   we had million outstanding under our us credit facility at an average interest rate of  and had the ability to borrow an additional million 
for further information regarding our us asset based secured credit facility  refer to note long term debt to the consolidated financial statements  which information is incorporated herein by reference 
in the third quarter of fiscal year  we renegotiated our loan agreement with banco ficohsa  a honduran bank 
proceeds from the 
table of contents new loan agreement were used to extinguish the existing loan indebtedness and resulted in no gain or loss being recorded upon extinguishment 
as of june   we had a total of million outstanding on this loan 
for further information regarding our honduran credit facility  refer to note long term debt to the consolidated financial statements  which information is incorporated herein by reference 
our primary cash needs are for working capital and capital expenditures  as well as to fund share repurchases under our stock repurchase program 
in addition  in the future we may use cash to pay dividends 
derivative instruments we use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rates 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for purposes of trading or speculation 
when we enter into a derivative instrument  we determine whether hedge accounting can be applied 
where hedge accounting can be applied  a hedge relationship is designated as either a fair value hedge or cash flow hedge 
the hedge is documented at inception  detailing the particular risk objective and strategy considered for undertaking the hedge 
the documentation identifies the specific asset or liability being hedged  the risk being hedged  the type of derivative used and how effectiveness of the hedge will be assessed 
on september   we entered into three interest rate swap agreements  as follows effective date notational amount libor rate maturity date interest rate swap million interest rate swap million interest rate swap million we assessed these agreements and concluded that the swap agreements match the exact terms of the underlying debt except for a slight timing difference 
we use a hypothetical derivative method to assess and measure ineffectiveness associated with the hedge each reporting period 
during fiscal year  the interest rate swap agreements had minimal ineffectiveness and were considered highly effective hedges 
changes in the derivatives fair values are deferred and are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci  net of income taxes  until the underlying transaction is recorded 
when the hedged item affects income  gains or losses are reclassified from aoci to the consolidated statements of operations as interest income expense 
any ineffectiveness in our hedging relationships is recognized immediately in the consolidated statement of operations 
the changes in fair value of the interest rate swap agreements resulted in an aoci loss  net of taxes  of million for the year ended june  and an aoci gain  net of taxes  of million the year ended july  operating cash flows in fiscal year  operating activities used million in cash compared to million in cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year the decrease in operating cash flow during fiscal year compared to the prior year resulted primarily from lower net income 
the cash flow used by operating activities in fiscal year resulted from our net loss combined with lower accounts payable  taxes payable and accrued expenses 
the cash flow provided by operating activities in fiscal year resulted from net income combined with higher accounts payable and accrued expenses partially offset by increased inventory levels due to higher raw material costs and increased accounts receivables due to higher sales 
investing cash flows cash used in investing activities in fiscal year was million compared to million for fiscal year in fiscal year  we used million in cash for the purchase of property and equipment primarily to improve our information technology in both our branded and basics segments  and to increase our post production decorating and warehouse capacity and lower costs in our manufacturing facilities  which support both our branded and basics segments 
in fiscal year  we used million for the purchase of property and equipment primarily to improve our manufacturing platform and business operating systems 
we also spent million in fiscal year for the cotton exchange acquisition 
we expect to spend approximately million in capital expenditures in fiscal year  most of which will focus on screen print modernization and expansion in both our international and us facilities  branding and point of sale displays for branded products 
financing activities cash provided from financing activities was million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the cash was primarily provided from our revolving facilities 
during fiscal year the cash was used for working capital  for capital expenditures and for the purchase of our common stock 
during fiscal year the cash was used to fund the acquisition of the cotton exchange  for capital expenditures and for the purchase of our common stock 

table of contents future liquidity and capital resources based on our expectations  we believe that our credit facility should be sufficient to satisfy our foreseeable working capital needs  and that the cash flow generated by our operations and funds available under our credit line should be sufficient to service our debt payment requirements  to satisfy our day to day working capital needs and to fund our planned capital expenditures 
any material deterioration in our results of operations  however  may result in our losing the ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility and to issue letters of credit to suppliers or may cause the borrowing availability under our facility to be insufficient for our needs 
the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations  as of june   by future period 
payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years after years contractual obligations long term debt a operating leases capital leases letters of credit minimum royalty payments purchase obligations total b a we exclude interest payments from these amounts because the cash outlay for the interest is unknown and cannot be reliably estimated because the majority of the debt is under a revolving credit facility 
interest payments will be determined based upon the daily outstanding balance of the revolving credit facility and the prevailing interest rate during that time 
b we excluded deferred income tax liabilities of million from the contractual cash obligations table because we believe inclusion would not be meaningful 
refer to note income taxes to our consolidated financial statements for more information on our deferred income tax liabilities 
deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between tax bases of assets and liabilities and their respective book bases  which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the liabilities are settled at their reported financial statement amounts 
the results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future periods and therefore would not relate to liquidity needs 
as a result  including deferred income tax liabilities as payments due by period in the schedule could be misleading 
off balance sheet arrangements as of june   we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are material to our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows as defined by item a of regulation s k promulgated by the sec other than the letters of credit  operating leases  and purchase obligations described above 
we have entered into derivative interest rate contracts as described and included below in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item a of this report 
dividends and purchases of our own shares under our credit agreement  we are allowed to make cash dividends and stock repurchases if i as of the date of the payment or repurchase and after giving effect to the payment or repurchase  we have availability on that date of not less than million and average availability for the day period immediately preceding that date of not less than million  and ii the aggregate amount of dividends and stock repurchases after may  does not exceed million plus of our cumulative net income as defined in the amended loan agreement from the first day of fiscal year to the date of determination 
at june  and july   there was million and million  respectively  of retained earnings free of restrictions to make cash dividends or stock repurchases 
our board of directors did not declare  nor were any dividends paid  during fiscal years and we would expect that our board of directors would consider the advisability of instituting a dividend program in the future 
any future cash dividend payments will depend upon our earnings  financial condition  capital requirements  compliance with loan covenants and other relevant factors 
as of june   our board of directors had authorized management to use up to million to repurchase delta apparel stock in open market transactions under our stock repurchase program 
during fiscal years and  we purchased  shares and  shares  respectively  of our common stock for a total cost of million and million  respectively 
no purchases of our common stock were made during fiscal year as of june   we have purchased  shares of common stock for an aggregate of million since the inception of the stock repurchase program 
all purchases were made at the discretion of management 
as of june   million remained available for future purchases under our stock repurchase program  which does not have an expiration date 

table of contents critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our most critical accounting estimates  discussed below  pertain to revenue recognition  accounts receivable and related reserves  inventory and related reserves  the carrying value of goodwill  and the accounting for income taxes 
note to our consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues from product sales are recognized when ownership is transfered to the customer  which includes not only the passage of title  but also the transfer of the risk of loss related to the product 
at this point  the sales price is fixed and determinable  and we are reasonably assured of the collectibility of the sale 
the majority of our sales are shipped fob shipping point and revenue is therefore recognized when the goods are shipped to the customer 
for sales that are shipped fob destination point  we do not recognize the revenue until the goods are received by the customer 
shipping and handling charges billed to our customers are included in net revenue and the related costs are included in cost of goods sold 
revenues are reported on net sales basis  which is computed by deducting product returns  discounts and estimated returns and allowances 
we estimate returns and allowances on an ongoing basis by considering historical and current trends 
accounts receivable and related reserves in the normal course of business  we extend credit to our customers based upon defined credit criteria 
accounts receivable  as shown on our consolidated balance sheet  are net of related reserves 
we estimate the net collectibility of our accounts receivable and establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon this assessment 
in situations where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation  such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing  a specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount reasonably expected to be collected 
for all other customers  reserves are determined through analysis of the aging of accounts receivable balances  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms 
in addition  reserves are established for other concessions that have been extended to customers  including advertising  markdowns and other accommodations  net of historical recoveries 
these reserves are determined based upon historical deduction trends and evaluation of current market conditions 
significant changes in customer concentration or payment terms  deterioration of customer credit worthiness or further weakening in economic trends could have a significant impact on the collectibility of receivables and our operating results 
inventories and related reserves we state inventories at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out method 
inventory cost includes materials  labor and manufacturing overhead on manufactured inventory  and all direct and associated costs  including inbound freight  to acquire sourced products 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record reserves for obsolescence  excess quantities  irregulars and slow moving inventory based on historical selling prices  current market conditions  and forecasted product demand to reduce inventory to its net realizable value 
if actual selling prices are less favorable than those projected  or if sell through of the inventory is more difficult than anticipated  additional inventory reserves may be required 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a million lower of cost or market write down on the inventory in the delta catalog business and its firm purchase commitments for yarn resulting from historically high cotton prices in its inventory costs combined with declining selling prices 
the estimation of the total write down involves management judgments and assumptions including assumptions regarding future selling price forecasts  the allocation of raw materials between business units  the estimated costs to complete  disposal costs and a normal profit margin 
the inventory and yarn firm purchase commitments associated with this inventory write down was sold during our fiscal year goodwill and contingent consideration goodwill and definite lived intangibles were recorded in conjunction with our acquisitions of junkfood clothing company and art gun 
we did not record any separately identifiable indefinite lived intangibles associated with either of these acquisitions 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired 
goodwill must be tested for impairment at least annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired  and is required to be written down when impaired 
the goodwill impairment testing process 
table of contents involves the use of significant assumptions  estimates and judgments with respect to a variety of factors  including sales  gross margins  selling  general and administrative expenses  capital expenditures  cash flows and the selection of an appropriate discount rate  all of which are subject to inherent uncertainties and subjectivity 
when we perform goodwill impairment testing  our assumptions are based on annual business plans and other forecasted results  which we believe represent those of a market participant 
we select a discount rate  which is used to reflect market based estimates of the risks associated with the projected cash flows  based on the best information available as of the date of the impairment assessment 
in our second quarter of fiscal year  we identified indicators of impairment on the art gun goodwill 
the test of impairment indicated that the goodwill at art gun was fully impaired  resulting in a million impairment charge recorded in the fiscal quarter ended january  see note m significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our remeasurement of contingent consideration and testing for goodwill impairment  which information is herein incorporated by reference 
given the current macro economic environment and the uncertainties regarding its potential impact on our business  there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions used in our impairment tests will prove to be accurate predictions of the future 
if our assumptions regarding forecasted cash flows are not achieved  it is possible that an impairment review may be triggered and goodwill may be determined to be impaired 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
in fiscal year  we generated federal net operating losses of million 
we have classified this net operating loss in income taxes receivable as we believe this asset is fully realizable as we intend to carry this loss back against the taxable income from fiscal years and  which can sufficiently cover this loss 
we established a valuation allowance related to certain of our state operating loss carryforward amounts in accordance with the provisions of fasb codification no 
 income taxes asc 
we continually review the adequacy of the valuation allowance and recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets if reassessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized based on earnings forecasts in the respective state tax jurisdictions 
we had state net operating loss carryforwards nols in fiscal years and of approximately million and million  respectively 
we had deferred tax assets of million and million in fiscal years and related to these state nols  with related valuation allowances against them of approximately million as of both june  and july  these net loss carryforwards expire at various intervals through as of june   we had million of charitable contribution carryforwards for federal income tax purposes resulting in a deferred tax asset of million 
in fiscal year  million of the charitable carryforward expires  with the remaining million expiring in fiscal year the future charitable deduction in limited to of taxable income for each year 
based on our forecasts  we expect that we will have sufficient taxable income to use all of the charitable contributions before they expire 
therefore  we determined that no valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset associated with the charitable carryforward is required 
recent accounting standards for information regarding recently issued accounting standards  refer to note z and note aa to our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk sensitivity we have a supply agreement with parkdale america  llc parkdale to supply our yarn requirements until march  under the supply agreement  we purchase from parkdale all of our yarn requirements for use in our manufacturing operations  excluding yarns that parkdale does not manufacture or cannot manufacture due to temporary capacity constraints 
the purchase price of yarn is based upon the cost of cotton plus a fixed conversion cost 
thus  we are subject to the commodity risk of cotton prices and cotton price movements  which could result in unfavorable yarn pricing for us 
we fix the cotton prices as a component of the purchase price of yarn  pursuant to the supply agreement  in advance of the shipment of finished yarn from parkdale 
prices are set according to prevailing prices  as reported by the new york cotton exchange  at the time we elect to fix specific cotton prices 
yarn with respect to which we have fixed cotton prices at june  was valued at million  and is scheduled for delivery between july and october at june   a decline in the market price of the cotton covered by our fixed price yarn would have had a negative impact of approximately million on the value of the yarn 
this compares to what would have been a negative impact of million at the fiscal year end based on the yarn with fixed cotton prices at july  the impact of a decline in the market price of the cotton covered by our fixed price yarn would have been less at june  than at july  due to reduced commitments and lower cotton prices at june  compared to july  we may use derivatives  including cotton option contracts  to manage our exposure to movements in commodity prices 
we do not 
table of contents designate our options as hedge instruments upon inception 
accordingly  we mark to market changes in the fair market value of the options in cost of sales in the statements of income 
we did not own any cotton options contracts on june  or july  we are currently in discussions to secure a new agreement to supply our yarn requirements and do not believe a new agreement would change any competitive position we may currently have associated with the supply agreement 
if parkdale s operations are disrupted and it is not able to provide us with our yarn requirements  we may need to obtain yarn from alternative sources 
although alternative sources are presently available  we may not be able to enter into short term arrangements with substitute suppliers on terms as favorable as our current terms with parkdale 
in addition  the cotton futures we have fixed with parkdale may not be transferable to alternative yarn suppliers 
because there can be no assurance that we would be able to pass along the higher cost of yarn to our customers  this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
interest rate sensitivity our us revolving credit facility provides that the outstanding amounts owed shall bear interest at variable rates 
if the amount of outstanding floating rate indebtedness at june  under the us revolving credit facility had been outstanding during the entire year and the interest rate on this outstanding indebtedness was increased by basis points  our expense would have increased by approximately million  or  for the fiscal year 
this compares to an increase of million  or  for the fiscal year based on the outstanding floating rate indebtedness at july  the effect of a basis point increase in interest rates would have had a higher dollar impact for the year ended june  compared to the year ended july  due to the higher debt levels outstanding on july  the percentage increase is more significant for fiscal year than for fiscal year because our total interest expense for fiscal year was lower than our total interest expense for fiscal year the actual increase in interest expense resulting from a change in interest rates would depend on the magnitude of the increase in rates and the average principal balance outstanding 
derivatives from time to time  we may use interest rate swaps or other instruments to manage our interest rate exposure and reduce the impact of future interest rate changes
