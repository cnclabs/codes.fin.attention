table of contents part i item business overview we are a biotechnology company with fully integrated commercial and drug development operations with a primary focus in hematology and oncology 
our strategy is comprised of acquiring  developing and commercializing a broad and diverse pipeline of late stage clinical and commercial products 
in the united states  or the us  we market two oncology drugs  zevalin and fusilev and have two drugs  apaziquone and belinostat  in late stage development along with a diversified pipeline of novel drug candidates 
in january we entered into an agreement to acquire licensing rights to market zevalin outside of the us zevalin is currently approved for sale in more than countries 
we have assembled an integrated in house scientific team  including formulation development  clinical development  medical affairs  regulatory affairs  biostatistics and data management  and have established a commercial infrastructure for the marketing of our drug products 
we also leverage the expertise of our worldwide partners to assist in the execution of our strategy 
apaziquone is presently being studied in two large phase clinical trials for non muscle invasive bladder cancer  or nmibc  under strategic collaborations with allergan  inc  or allergan  nippon kayaku co 
ltd  or nippon kayaku  and handok pharmaceuticals co 
ltd  or handok 
belinostat  is being studied in multiple indications including a phase registrational trial for relapsed or refractory peripheral t cell lymphoma  or ptcl  under a strategic collaboration with topotarget a s  or topotarget 
our business strategy is comprised of the following initiatives maximizing the growth potential of our marketed drugs  zevalin and fusilev 
our near term outlook largely depends on sales and marketing successes for our two marketed drugs 
for zevalin  we stabilized sales in after several years of declining sales and continue to work on growing the zevalin brand  expand usage in non hodgkins lymphoma and expand indications through additional trials 
we intend to increase our sales and marketing activities related to zevalin as evidenced by the january agreement to acquire licensing rights to market zevalin outside of the us for fusilev  we are working to expand usage in colorectal cancer 
we have initiated and continue to build appropriate infrastructure and additional initiatives to facilitate broad customer reach and to address other market requirements  as appropriate 
we have formed a dedicated commercial organization comprised of highly experienced and motivated sales representatives  account managers  and a complement of other support marketing personnel to manage the sales and marketing of these drugs 
in addition our scientific department supports field activities through various mds  mds and other medical science liaison personnel 
for fusilev  which we launched in august  we were able to benefit from broad utilization in community clinics and hospitals and recognized a dramatic increase in sales beginning in the second half of due to a shortage of generic leucovorin 
there has been a history of recurring and unreliable supply of generic leucovorin 
in april  we received two fda approvals for fusilev 
the first fda approval was for the use of fusilev in combination with fluorouracil in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced metastatic colorectal cancer 
the second fda approval was for a ready to use  or rtu  formulation of fusilev 
we are now actively engaged in marketing fusilev for use in advanced metastatic colorectal cancer and have engaged a focused commercial sales organization to work with our commercial group to support efforts to grow fusilev sales 
optimizing our development portfolio and maximizing the asset values of its components 
while over the recent few years  we have evolved from a development stage to a commercial stage pharmaceutical company  we have maintained a highly focused development portfolio 
our strategy with regard to our development portfolio is to focus on late stage drugs and to develop them safely and expeditiously to the point of regulatory approval 
we plan to develop some of these drugs ourselves or with our subsidiaries and affiliates  or secure collaborations with third parties such that we are able to suitably monetize these assets 

table of contents we have assembled a drug development infrastructure that is comprised of highly experienced and motivated mds  mds  clinical research associates and a complement of other support personnel to develop these drugs 
during  we achieved our goal of completing enrollment in the two phase apaziquone trials with more than  patients enrolled and finished the evaluation of the last patient in december we expect to file an nda for apaziquone in we continue to work to maximize the value of apaziquone through further developmental efforts and additional trials 
with regard to our anti cancer drug belinostat  a novel hdac inhibitor  we have to date opened more than clinical sites 
we completed enrollment in september  and expect to file an nda in belinostat has received fast track designation from the u 
s 
food and drug administration  or the fda  which means  if the fda agrees  we can start filing a rolling new drug application even before the clinical package is ready  beginning with the filing of pre clinical data and chemistry manufacturing and control 
we have several other exciting compounds in earlier stages of development in our portfolio 
based upon a criteria based portfolio review  we are in the process of streamlining our pipeline drugs  allowing for greater focus and integration of our development and commercial goals 
expanding our pipeline of development stage and commercial drugs through business development activities 
it is our goal to identify new strategic opportunities that will create strong synergies with our currently marketed drugs and identify and pursue partnerships for out licensing certain of our drugs in development 
to this end  we will continue to explore strategic collaborations as these relate to drugs that are either in clinical trials or are currently on the market 
we believe that such opportunistic collaborations will provide synergies with respect to how we deploy our internal resources 
in this regard  we intend to identify and secure drugs that have significant growth potential either through enhanced marketing and sales efforts or through pursuit of additional clinical development 
in january  we entered into an agreement with viropro  inc for the development of a biosimilar version of the monoclonal antibody drug rituximab 
biosimilars  or follow on biologics  are terms used to describe officially approved subsequent versions of innovator biopharmaceutical products made by a different sponsor following patent and exclusivity expiry 
under the agreement  we paid a nominal upfront payment and are required to make additional payments based on certain development  regulatory and sales milestones should we elect to continue development efforts 
in late january  we entered into a co development and commercialization agreement with hanmi pharmaceutical company for spi formerly known as laps gcsf  a drug for the treatment of chemotherapy induced neutropenia 
we believe our in licensing of belinostat  a novel histone deacetylase  or hdac  inhibitor  is also demonstrative of such business development efforts outlined above 
managing our financial resources effectively 
we remain committed to fiscal discipline  a policy which has allowed us to become well capitalized among our peers  despite a very challenging capital markets environment beginning in and continuing through this policy includes the pursuit of non dilutive funding options  prudent expense management  and the achievement of critical synergies within our operations in order to maintain a reasonable burn rate 
even with the continued build up in operational infrastructure to facilitate the marketing of our two commercial drugs  we intend to be fiscally prudent in any expansion we undertake 
in terms of revenue generation  we rely on sales from currently marketed drugs and intend to pursue out licensing of select pipeline drugs in select territories  as discussed above 
when appropriate  we may pursue other sources of financing  including non dilutive financing alternatives 
while we are currently focused on advancing our key drug development programs  we anticipate that we will make regular determinations as to which other programs  if any  to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program on an ongoing basis  based on clinical success and commercial potential  including termination of our existing development programs  especially if we do not expect value being realized from continued development 

table of contents further enhancing the organizational structure to meet our corporate objectives 
we have highly experienced staff in pharmaceutical operations  clinical development  regulatory and commercial functions who previously held positions at both small to mid size biotech companies  as well as large pharmaceutical companies 
we have strengthened the ranks of our management team  and will continue to pursue talent on an opportunistic basis 
finally  we remain committed to running a lean and efficient organization  while effectively leveraging our critical resources 
recent developments in and early  we have continued to execute on our business strategy described above 
we discuss below the key developments during that period 
in january  we entered into an agreement with viropro  inc for the development of a biosimilar version of the monoclonal antibody drug rituximab 
in april of  we received two fda approvals for fusilev 
the first fda approval was for the use of fusilev in combination with fluorouracil in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced metastatic colorectal cancer 
the second fda approval was for an rtu formulation of fusilev 
we recorded approximately million in product sales for the year as compared to million in of which fusilev sales were million as compared to million in in november  we received approval from the fda to remove the pre treatment biodistribution evaluation requirement  commonly referred to as the bioscan from the zevalin administration procedures 
in december  at the annual meeting of the american society of hematology in san diego  california  a total of scientific papers on zevalin were presented 
of these  papers were selected by the program committee of ash for oral presentation 
encouraging data were seen in diverse patient groups  including those with newly diagnosed follicular lymphoma  relapsed refractory follicular lymphoma  marginal zone lymphoma and patients who have received autologous or allogeneic transplantation 
one oral presentation was recognized with special distinction as having the potential impact of changing the standard of care from current therapeutic approaches 
additionally  there were four abstracts related to using zevalin for consolidation after response to chemotherapy 
all studies presented at this meeting were investigator sponsored studies 
in january  we entered into an agreement to acquire licensing rights to market zevalin  outside of the us  from bayer pharma ag 
zevalin is currently approved for sale in more than countries for the treatment of b cell non hodgkin lymphoma  including countries in europe  latin america and asia 
under the agreement  spectrum will have marketing rights  patents  and access to existing inventory of zevalin from bayer 
spectrum intends to utilize a combination of company resources and partnerships to support the product outside the us in late january  we entered into a co development and commercialization agreement with hanmi pharmaceutical company for spi formerly known as laps gcsf  a drug for the treatment of chemotherapy induced neutropenia based on hanmi s proprietary lapscovery technology 
we expect to initiate phase trials in collaboration with hanmi in if spi is ultimately commercialized  we will have worldwide rights except for korea  china and japan 
we expect to receive top line data in from two phase pivotal clinical trials for apaziquone 
the two trials enrolled more than  patients with non muscle invasive bladder cancer 
through the above referenced agreements and our continued efforts  we strive to continue to build a global pharmaceutical organization in for two of our non us business entities  spectrum pharma canada  inc  a canadian affiliate headquartered in the province of quebec  canada  and oncorx pharma private ltd  a wholly owned indian subsidiary headquartered in mumbai  india  we continue to grow and establish these entities in an effort to facilitate the opening of clinical trials sites in these countries to advance the clinical development of our products at a reduced cost 

table of contents product portfolio we have a product portfolio consisting of both commercial stage and development stage products 
while we are committed to growing the sales of our marketed products  we strive to maintain a robust pipeline of products under development to bring to market 
our drug products  their approved and or target indications  and status of development are summarized in the following table  and discussed below in further detail logo some of our drugs may prove to be beneficial in additional disease indications as we continue their study and development 
in addition  we have intellectual property rights to neurology compounds that we may out license to third parties for further development 

table of contents overview of cancer according to the american cancer society s publication cancer facts figures  cancer is the second leading cause of death in the us  accounting for approximately of all deaths 
in the us  approximately million new cancer cases were expected to be diagnosed in and over  persons were expected to die from the disease in accordingly  there is significant demand for improved and novel cancer treatments 
cancer develops when cells in a part of the body begin to grow out of control 
although there are many kinds of cancer  they all start because of out of control growth of abnormal cells 
normal body cells grow  divide  and die in an orderly fashion 
during the early years of a person s life  normal cells divide more rapidly until the person becomes an adult 
after that  cells in most parts of the body divide only to replace worn out or dying cells and to repair injuries 
because cancer cells continue to grow and divide  they are different from normal cells 
instead of dying  they outlive normal cells and continue to form new abnormal cells 
cancer cells may develop because of damage to dna 
most of the time  when dna becomes damaged  the body is able to repair it 
in cancer cells  the damaged dna is not repaired 
people can inherit damaged dna  which accounts for inherited cancers 
more often  however  a person s dna becomes damaged by exposure to something in the environment  such as smoking or a virus 
cancer usually forms as a tumor 
some cancers  like leukemia  do not form tumors 
instead  these cancer cells involve the blood and blood forming organs and circulate through other tissues where they may grow 
often  cancer cells travel to other parts of the body where they begin to grow and replace normal tissue 
this process is called metastasis 
regardless of where a cancer may spread  however  it is always named for the place it began 
for instance  breast cancer that spreads to the liver is still called breast cancer  not liver cancer 
different types of cancer can behave very differently 
for example  lung cancer and breast cancer are very different diseases 
they grow at different rates and respond to different treatments 
that is why people with cancer need treatment that is aimed at their particular kind of cancer 
cancer is currently treated by surgery  chemotherapy  radiation therapy  hormonal therapy  biological therapy and immunotherapy 
cancer is referred to as refractory when it has not responded  or is no longer responding  to a treatment 
we are seeking novel drugs that address cancer or cancer related indications with significant unmet medical need  that are already approved for sale or have demonstrated initial safety and efficacy in clinical trials and or we believe have a higher probability of regulatory approval than that of a typical compound at a similar stage of development  target cancer indications with significant unmet medical need  where current treatments either do not exist or are not deemed to be effective  and we believe we can acquire at a fair value based on our judgment of clinical success and commercial potential 

table of contents development of our drug products zevalin 
y 
ibritumomab tiuxetan in december  we acquired rights to commercialize and develop zevalin in the us  as the result of a transaction with cell therapeutics  inc  or cti as further described below 
in january  we entered into an agreement with bayer pharma ag to acquire licensing rights to market zevalin outside of the us as part of the zevalin therapeutic regimen  the y radioisotope is combined with a monoclonal antibody cd mab that specifically recognizes a particular part of a b cell the cells of the immune system that make antibodies to invading pathogens called the cd antigen 
the cd antigen is found on malignant and normal b cells 
as the patient is infused with y zevalin and it enters the bloodstream  the antibody portion recognizes and attaches to the cd antigen on tumor cells  allowing the radiation energy emitted from the y radioisotope ie  beta emission to penetrate and damage the malignant b cells as well as nearby neighboring cells  many of which are also lymphoma cells 
zevalin was approved by the fda in february of for the treatment of follicular non hodgkin s lymphoma  or nhl 
zevalin was approved as part of a zevalin therapeutic regimen for treatment of relapsed or refractory  low grade or follicular b cell nhl  including patients with rituximab refractory follicular nhl 
for reference  the term refractory refers to lymphoma that does not respond to a particular therapy 
the term relapsed refers to lymphoma that returns after initially responding to therapy 
the terms low grade and follicular refer to types of lymphoma cells as determined by laboratory and microscopy tests  which have an indolent slow growing clinical course 
rituximab is a monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes a particular part of a b cell also called the cd antigen  and is used as monotherapy or in combination with other agents for the treatment of b cell nhl 
nhl is caused by the abnormal proliferation of white blood cells and normally spreads through the lymphatic system  a system of vessels that drains fluid from the body 
there are many different types of nhl which can be divided into aggressive nhl  a rapidly spreading acute form of the disease  and indolent nhl  which progresses more slowly  and can be classified as either b cell or t cell nhl 
according to the national cancer institute s seer database there were nearly  people in the us with nhl in the american cancer society estimated that in the u 
s 
 people were expected to be newly diagnosed with nhl in additionally  approximately  were expected to die from this disease in in december  the fda accepted for filing and review  and granted priority review status for rit oncology  llc s or rit s  supplemental biologics license application  or sbla for the use of zevalin as first line therapy for patients with a previously untreated follicular nhl who achieve a partial or complete response of first line chemotherapy 
the sbla was based upon data from the multinational  randomized phase first line indolent trial  or fit  which evaluated the efficacy and safety of a single infusion of zevalin in patients with cd positive follicular nhl who had achieved a partial response or a complete response after receiving one of the standard first line chemotherapy regimens 
the fit trial demonstrated that when used as a first line consolidation therapy for patients with follicular nhl  zevalin significantly improved the median progression free survival time from months control arm to months zevalin arm p 
the primary investigators of the study concluded that zevalin consolidation of first remission in advanced stage follicular nhl is highly effective  resulting in a total complete response cr cru rate of percent and prolongation of median progression free survival by almost two years  with a toxicity profile comparable to that seen with zevalin s use in relapsed or refractory indications 
in september  we received fda approval for the sbla 
additionally  in november  the centers for medicaid medicare services or the cms decided that zevalin should be reimbursed under an average sales price  or asp  methodology in the hospital outpatient prospective payment system  or hopps  and issued a corresponding proposed rule  which went into effect on january  the asp methodology is widely used for injectable chemotherapy drugs and creates a consistent reimbursement standard in the hospital setting 

table of contents in december at the annual meeting of the american society of hematology  or the ash  in san diego  california  a total of scientific papers on zevalin were presented 
of these  papers were selected by the program committee of ash for oral presentations 
encouraging data were seen in diverse patient groups  including those with newly diagnosed follicular lymphoma  relapsed refractory follicular lymphoma  marginal zone lymphoma and patients who have received autologous or allogeneic transplantation 
one oral presentation was selected for a special recognition as having the potential to change the standard of care for these patients 
additionally  there were four abstracts related to using zevalin for consolidation after response to chemotherapy 
all studies presented at this meeting were investigator sponsored studies 
the following describes the principal commercial terms relating to zevalin licensing and development on december   we closed a transaction to form a owned joint venture in an entity called rit oncology  llc or rit  with cti 
cti previously acquired the us rights to develop  market and sell zevalin from biogen idec  inc  or biogen on december  upon entering into the joint venture arrangement  cti contributed the zevalin product assets to rit in exchange for a membership interest in rit and the cash payments to cti noted below 
cti received an initial cash payment of million at the closing of the joint venture transaction on december   and received an additional million cash payment in early january cti also had the option to sell its remaining membership interest in rit to us  subject to adjustment for any amounts owed between rit and cti at the time of sale 
cti exercised this put option in february on march   we entered into an agreement with cti to complete such sale for an aggregate amount of million subject to certain adjustments for  among other things  payables determined to be owed between cti and rit 
cti disputed the adjustments  but in a may arbitration proceeding  we were awarded approximately million 
as a result of the sale  we own of rit and are its sole member and therefore  we have  through licenses  all of the us rights to zevalin 
in connection with obtaining the required consent of biogen to the foregoing joint venture arrangement  we entered into certain agreements with biogen 
such agreements included an amendment to the original asset purchase agreement between cti and biogen  referred to as the cti biogen agreement  modifying future milestone payments  to provide that i concurrently with the execution of the amendment cti was required to pay biogen million which was reimbursed to cti by rit from the initial capital contributions made by cti and us  ii upon the december closing of the joint venture transaction  cti was required to pay biogen an additional million which was paid by rit as successor to cti under the amendment  iii upon the achievement of the specified fda approval milestone  rit as successor to cti was required to pay biogen an additional amount of million if the milestone event occurred in provided that rit may elect to defer any such payment until january   but upon such election the required payment will increase to million  million if the milestone event occurs in  million if the milestone event occurs in  or million if the milestone event occurs in or later 
as disclosed above  in we received fda approval for the treatment of patients with previously untreated follicular nhl who achieve a partial or complete response to first line chemotherapy and in accordance with the amendment  we paid biogen million 
no other material terms of the cti biogen agreement were modified 
cti s rights and obligations  including its payment obligations to biogen  including royalties on net sales of zevalin and an additional regulatory milestone payment  under both the cti biogen agreement and the amendment were assigned to and assumed by rit in connection with the closing of the joint venture transaction 
an amendment to the original supply agreement between biogen and cti  referred to as the cti biogen supply agreement  modifying certain of the pricing and manufacturing technology transfer terms contained in the cti biogen supply agreement and also providing that the term of the agreement may be shortened in some instances in the event of a mid term manufacturing technology transfer 
cti s rights and obligations  including its payment obligations to biogen  under both the cti biogen supply agreement and the amendment were assigned to and assumed by rit in connection with the closing of the joint venture transaction 

table of contents a security agreement  by and between rit and biogen whereby rit granted to biogen a first priority security interest in all of rit s assets  including the assets contributed to rit by cti in connection with the closing of the joint venture transaction  to secure certain payment  indemnification and other obligations of rit to biogen 
a guarantee  by us for the benefit of biogen whereby we have  among other things  guaranteed the payment and performance all of rit s obligations to biogen including its obligations as assignee of cti under all contractual arrangements between cti and biogen that were assigned to and assumed by rit in connection with the closing of the joint venture transaction 
pursuant to the transfer of zevalin assets from cti to rit in december  rit assumed certain license and sublicense agreements with various third parties related to zevalin intellectual property under which rit is required to make certain payment obligations including milestone payments and royalties 
in january  we entered into an agreement to acquire licensing rights to market zevalin outside of the us from bayer pharma ag 
zevalin is currently approved for sale in more than countries outside the us for the treatment of b cell non hodgkin lymphoma  including countries in europe  latin america and asia 
under the agreement  spectrum will have marketing rights  patents  and access to existing inventory of zevalin from bayer 
spectrum plans to utilize a combination of company resources and partnerships to support the product outside the us fusilev levoleucovorin for injection on march   our new drug application or nda for our proprietary drug fusilev was approved by the fda 
we commercially launched fusilev in august  with an in house sales force and commercialization team 
subsequent to the launch  in november  we received a unique j code for fusilev from cms  which went into effect on january  the j code is a unique  product specific billing code that assists providers eg  physicians that prescribe fusilev in obtaining reimbursement for fusilev 
fusilev is a novel folate analog formulation and the pharmacologically active isomer the levo isomer of the racemic compound  calcium leucovorin 
isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula  but mirror image atomic structures 
leucovorin is a mixture of equal parts of both isomers the pharmacologically active levo isomer and the inactive dextro isomer 
preclinical studies have demonstrated that the inactive dextro isomer may compete with the active levo isomer for uptake at the cellular level 
by removing the inactive dextro form  the dosage of fusilev is one half that of leucovorin and patients are spared the administration of an inactive substance 
fusilev rescue is indicated after high dose methotrexate therapy in patients with osteosarcoma  and to diminish the toxicity and counteract the effects of impaired methotrexate elimination or inadvertent overdose of folic acid antagonists 
fusilev has been designated as an orphan drug for its approved indications 
methotrexate is a widely used anti cancer drug 
it is a therapeutic option in the treatment of solid tumors and hematological malignancies  such as nhl 
in addition  methotrexate is also used to treat autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis 
the american cancer society estimated that the incidence of colorectal cancer in the u 
s 
would be approximately  and is the third most common cancer in both men and women 
leucovorin is currently a standard combination agent with fu in various colorectal cancer treatment regimens 
leucovorin potentiates the effects of fu and its derivatives by stabilizing the binding of the drug s metabolite to its target enzyme  thus prolonging drug activity 
there are peer reviewed publications wherein fusilev is used in place of the leucovorin in combination with fu containing regimens for adjuvant and advanced colorectal cancer and in combination with oxaliplatin and or irinotecan for advanced disease 
the national comprehensive cancer network clinical practice guidelines in oncology tm in colon cancer and rectal cancer have been updated to reflect that fusilev is available in the us additionally  in the fourth quarter of  fusilev was listed and continues to be listed in the nccn drugs and biologic compendium for use in combination with high dose methotrexate for the treatment of bone cancer osteosarcoma and de differentiated chrondrosarcoma 
the nccn drugs and biologics compendium is an important reference that has been recognized by united healthcare as a formal guidance for coverage policy 
in addition  cms announced in june that it would recognize the nccn drugs biologics compendium as a source of information to determine which drugs may be covered under medicare part b 

table of contents the following describes the principal commercial terms relating to fusilev licensing and development 
in april  we acquired all of the oncology drug product assets of targent  inc pursuant to the agreement  as of the end of  targent has received all payments provided for under the agreement based on the achievement of certain regulatory and sales milestones 
we made such payments in a combination of our common stock and cash 
in may  we amended and restated a license agreement with merck cie ag  a swiss corporation  which we assumed in connection with the acquisition of the assets of targent 
pursuant to the license agreement with merck cie  we obtained the exclusive license to use regulatory filings related to fusilev and a non exclusive license under certain patents and know how related to fusilev to develop  make  and have made  use  sell and have sold fusilev in the field of oncology in north america 
in addition  we have the right of first opportunity to negotiate an exclusive license to manufacture  have manufactured  use and sell fusilev products outside the field of oncology in north america 
also  under the terms of the license agreement  we paid merck cie  for the achievement of fda approval of fusilev 
merck cie is also eligible to receive a payment upon achievement of another regulatory milestone  in addition to royalties on net sales 
the term of the license agreement is determined on a product by product and country by country basis until royalties are no longer owed under the license agreement 
the license agreement expires in its entirety after the date that we no longer owe any royalties to merck cie 
we have the unilateral right to terminate the license agreement  in its entirety or on a product by product or country by country basis  at any time for any reason and either party may terminate the license agreement due to material breach of the terms of the license agreement by or insolvency of the other party 
apaziquone apaziquone is an anti cancer agent that becomes activated by certain enzymes often present in higher amounts in cancer cells than in normal cells 
it is currently being investigated for the treatment of nmibc  which is a cancer that is only in the innermost layer of the bladder and has not spread to deeper layers of the bladder 
the american cancer society estimated that the incidence and prevalence of bladder cancer in the us would be approximately  and over  respectively 
according to botteman et al  pharmacoeconomics  bladder cancer is the most expensive cancer to treat on a lifetime basis 
the initial treatment of this cancer is complete surgical removal of the tumor 
however  bladder cancer is a highly recurrent disease with approximately of patients recurring within years  and a majority of patients recurring within years 
this high recurrence rate is attributed to the highly implantable nature of cancer cells that are dispersed during surgery  incomplete tumor resection  and tumors present in multiple locations in the bladder which may be missed or too small to visualize at the time of resection 
despite evidence in the published literature and guidance from the american and european urology associations  instillation of a chemotherapeutic agent immediately following surgery is not a standard clinical practice 
currently  there are no approved drugs for this indication which may  in part  explain the difference between the literature and urology guidelines and actual clinical management of this disease 
for more than years  no new drugs have been introduced in the market for treatment of nmibc 
an immediate instillation of apaziquone may help by reducing tumor recurrence by destroying dispersed cancer cells that would otherwise re implant onto the inner lining of the bladder  by destroying remaining cancer cells at the site of tumor resection also known as chemo resection  and by destroying tumors not observed during resection also known as chemo ablation 
apaziquone is a bio reductive alkylating indoloquinone that is enzymatically activated by enzymes that are over expressed by bladder tumors 
pharmacokinetic studies have verified that apaziquone is rarely detectable in the bloodstream of patients when it is administered either after surgical resection or as a part of a delayed multi instillation protocol 
the proposed dose therefore carries a minimal risk of systemic toxicity which could arise from absorption of a drug through the bladder wall into the bloodstream 
additionally  the current proposed dose is a fraction of the systemic toxic dose 
these features of apaziquone are distinct from other intravesical agents currently in use for the treatment of recurrent bladder cancer 
a phase dose escalation marker lesion tumor study demonstrated that apaziquone had no systemic toxicity  and was well tolerated at the dose level being used in the phase trials 
apaziquone also demonstrated anti tumor activity against nmibc  as evidenced by eight of twelve patients showing a complete response  defined as the complete disappearance of the marker lesion as confirmed by biopsy  after receiving six treatments with apaziquone over a period of six weeks 

table of contents phase data has confirmed anti tumor activity in patients with multiple  recurrent nmibc  as evidenced by of patients showing a complete response after receiving six weekly treatments with mg of apaziquone instilled into the urinary bladder in this marker lesion study 
apaziquone was well tolerated  with no significant systemic toxicity  and local toxicity limited to temporary chemical cystitis inflammation of the urinary bladder resulting in increased urinary frequency  dysuria painful urination and hematuria blood in the urine in a few patients 
at the two year follow up  eighteen patients were disease free 
in september  we initiated an open label  multi center clinical study in europe in high risk nmibc in patients 
patients with high risk nmibc usually have more aggressive bladder cancer with higher incidence of recurrence and or progression to a more invasive stage  where the cancer invades the muscle wall of the bladder  which may require total surgical removal of the bladder 
apaziquone was well tolerated over multiple instillations in this study of patients with high risk superficial bladder cancer 
at months follow up of the patients were recurrence free 
in  we performed a patient pilot safety study in low grade nmibc 
in this study  apaziquone was found to be well tolerated when a single mg dose is given to patients immediately following surgery 
in addition  there was no adverse effect on wound healing and apaziquone was not detected in the bloodstream 
in march  we received agreement from the fda for the design of a phase study protocol for the treatment of non invasive bladder cancer under a special protocol assessment procedure 
the development plan for apaziquone is two randomized  double blind  placebo controlled phase clinical trials  each with evaluable patients with tag g low grade nmibc 
patients are being randomized in a one to one ratio to apaziquone or placebo 
under the protocol  the patients are given a single mg dose following surgical removal of the tumors 
the primary endpoint is a statistically significant difference p in the rate of tumor recurrence at year two between the apaziquone patient group and the placebo group 
the first study began during the second quarter of  and the second study began during the third quarter of in  we received scientific advice from the european medicines agency  or the emea whereby the emea agreed that the two phase studies as designed should be sufficient for a regulatory decision regarding european registration 
in december  we achieved our goal of completing enrollment for both phase clinical trials and we expect top line data in the following describes the principal commercial terms relating to apaziquone licensing and development 
in october  we terminated our license agreement for apaziquone with inc research  formerly nddo research foundation or inc in the netherlands  as the patents underlying the agreement were all about to expire 
pursuant to the termination  inc assigned to us all rights it had in the know how or intellectual property licensed under the agreement and all rights in may have had in any know how or intellectual property created during the term of the agreement 
in exchange  we paid inc a nominal amount of cash and issued them a nominal number of shares of our common stock 
in addition  inc is entitled to up to  additional shares of our common stock and an additional payment of  upon achievement of certain regulatory milestones 
in october   we entered into a license  development  supply and distribution agreement with allergan pursuant to which we and allergan agreed to collaboration for the development and commercialization of a formulation of apaziquone suitable for use in treating cancer or precancerous conditions via instillation 
the agreement with allergan also provides that allergan has the exclusive right to make  develop and commercialize apaziquone for the treatment of bladder cancer  or pre bladder cancer conditions worldwide except for asia as is defined in the agreement 
we also entered into a co promotion agreement with allergan providing for the joint commercialization of apaziquone in the us  whereby we and allergan will share equally all profits and commercialization expenses 
in consideration for the rights granted under our license  development  supply and distribution agreements with allergan  allergan paid us an up front fee of million 
in addition  allergan will pay us up to million based on the achievement of certain development  regulatory and sales milestones 
for example  for completing enrollment of both aforementioned phase iii trials by year end  allergan paid us a million milestone payment 
also  allergan has agreed to pay us tiered royalties starting in the mid teens based on a percentage of net sales of the apaziquone outside of the us 
table of contents we will continue to conduct the current phase clinical trials as well as certain future planned clinical trials pursuant to a joint development plan  of which allergan will fund of the development costs 
in november  we entered into a collaboration agreement with the nippon kayaku co  ltd 
for the development and commercialization of apaziquone in asia  except north and south korea the nippon kayaku territory 
in exchange  nippon kayaku paid spectrum an up front payment of million and agreed to make additional payments of up to million based on the achievement of certain regulatory and commercialization milestones contained in the agreement 
in addition  nippon kayaku received exclusive rights to apaziquone for the treatment of nmibc in asia other than north and south korea  including japan and china 
nippon kayaku will conduct apaziquone clinical trials in the nippon kayaku territory pursuant to a development plan 
in addition  nippon kayaku will be responsible for all expenses relating to the development and commercialization of apaziquone in the nippon kayaku territory 
in january nippon kayaku initiated a phase study with the first patient being dosed in japan 
the phase study is required by the local regulatory authorities and is designed to enroll up to patients 
also in november  we entered into a collaboration agreement with handok pharmaceuticals for the development and commercialization of apaziquone in north and south korea 
under the terms of the handok collaboration agreement  handok paid us an up front payment of million and potential milestone payments totaling approximately million 
the potential milestone payments will be based on the achievement of certain regulatory and commercialization milestones 
handok received rights to apaziquone for the treatment of nmibc in north and south korea 
additionally  handok will conduct the apaziquone clinical trials in north and south korea pursuant to a development plan and will be responsible for all expenses relating to the development and commercialization of apaziquone in north and south korea 
belinostat belinostat is a histone deacytelase  or hdac  inhibitor that is being studied in multiple clinical trials  both as a single drug and in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs for the treatment of various hematological and solid tumors 
hdacs catalyze the removal of chemical groups known as acetyl groups from certain portions of human dna  and thus regulate gene expression 
by inhibiting this enzyme  belinostat induces cell cycle arrest  and leads to inhibition of cancer cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis  or cell death 
additional mechanisms of action thought to be responsible for belinostat s anti cancer effect include inhibition of angiogenesis  or blood vessel growth  and the resensitization of cells that have overcome drug resistance to anticancer drugs  such as platinums and taxanes 
belinostat is currently the only hdac inhibitor in clinical development with multiple potential routes of administration  including intravenous administration  continuous intravenous infusion and oral administration  which we believe may afford belinostat with a significant competitive advantage 
belinostat is currently in a registrational trial  under a special protocol assessment  as a monotherapy for relapsed refractory peripheral t cell lymphoma or ptcl an indication which has been granted orphan drug and fast track designation by the fda 
the registrational trial is an open label  multicenter  single arm efficacy and safety study  in which we plan to enroll approximately patients with relapsed or refractory peripheral t cell lymphoma  who have failed at least one prior systemic therapy 
we expect to file an nda for belinostat in ptcl in belinostat is also currently in a randomized phase trial for carcinoma of unknown primary or cup  in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel being conducted by our collaborator  topotarget 
target enrollment was reached in december and topotarget expects top line results of progression free survival and response rate in the second half of there are currently no approved therapies or drugs for treatment of cup  which is an indication with a large patient population 
the national cancer institute estimated that for  approximately to of all cancers are cup 
based on the data from past and ongoing studies  we believe there are many potential attributes associated with belinostat that separate it from other currently marketed hdacs  including efficacy when used alone and in combination  less toxicities when compared to other currently marketed hdacs  including less bone marrow 
table of contents toxicity  and a lack of other severe side effects  such as mucositis  that may enable full dose combinations of this drug with several other cytotoxic agents 
hence  belinostat is currently being investigated in multiple indications  both as monotherapy and in combination with other treatment regimens 
numerous studies have been conducted  and are ongoing  through the nci and other well known oncologic academic institutions 
additionally  we plan on a comprehensive development program for belinostat  which includes both hematologic indications  such as ptcl  and solid tumor indications  such as ovarian cancer  colorectal cancer and cup 
based upon the foregoing  we believe belinostat potentially has broad applicability and hence  commercial potential beyond that of currently marketed hdacs 
the following describes the principal commercial terms relating to belinostat licensing and development 
in february  we entered into a licensing and collaboration agreement with topotarget  for the development and commercialization of belinostat  pursuant to which we agreed to collaboration for the development and commercialization of belinostat 
the agreement provides that we have the exclusive right to make  develop and commercialize belinostat in north america and india  with an option for china 
the agreement also grants topotarget a co promote option if and only if we do not maintain a minimum number subject to adjustment for certain events outside of our control of field personnel as defined in the agreement for a certain number of years post approval of the ptcl indication 
in consideration for the rights granted to us under the license and collaboration agreement with topotarget  we paid topotarget an up front fee of million 
in addition  we will pay up to million and one million shares of spectrum common stock based on the achievement of certain development  regulatory and sales milestones 
as well as certain royalties on net sales of belinostat 
under the terms of the agreement  all development  including studies  will be conducted under a joint development plan and in accordance with a mutually agreed upon target product profile provided that we have final decision making authority for all developmental activities in north america and india and china upon exercise of the option for china and topotarget has final decision making authority for all developmental activities in all other jurisdictions  we will assume all responsibility for and future costs of the ongoing registrational ptcl trial while topotarget will assume all responsibility for and future costs of the ongoing phase cup trial 
we and topotarget will conduct future planned clinical trials pursuant to the joint development plan  of which we will fund of the development costs and topotarget will fund of the development costs 
we and topotarget will each pay of the costs for chemical  pharmaceutical and other process development related to the manufacturing of the product that are incurred with a mutually agreed upon budget in the joint development plan 
topotarget is responsible for supplying us with both clinical and commercial product 
ozarelix ozarelix is a luteinizing hormone releasing hormone  or lhrh  antagonist a substance that blocks the effects of a natural hormone found in the body 
mechanistically  lhrh antagonists exert rapid inhibition of luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone with an accompanying rapid decrease in sex hormones and would therefore be expected to be effective in a variety of hormonally dependent disease states including ovarian cancer  prostate cancer  benign prostatic hyperplasia  or bph  infertility  uterine myoma and endometriosis 
in january  based upon the mixed results of our earlier phase study of ozarelix for the treatment of bph and the recently announced failure of aeterna zentaris s large  phase  registrational trial of cetrorelix another lhrh antagonist  we discontinued development of ozarelix in bph 
currently  we are conducting a randomized phase ii clinical trial of ozarelix in prostate cancer patients 
the following describes the principal commercial terms relating to ozarelix licensing and development 
in  we entered into a license agreement with a subsidiary of aeterna zentaris  inc  aeterna zentaris gmbh  whereby we acquired an exclusive license to develop and commercialize ozarelix in north america including canada and mexico and india 
in addition  we have a financial interest in any income aeterna zentaris derives from ozarelix in japan 
we are contingently obligated to pay amounts based upon achievement of milestones and a royalty based on any future net sales 
in november  we amended the terms of the agreement to expand the territory covered by the exclusive license 

table of contents the term of the license agreement expires ten years after the first commercial sale of a product in any country within the territory or as long as any product is covered by a patent in any country in the territory  and where there is no generic competition in such country of the territory  whichever term is longer  although some obligations survive termination 
in addition  the agreement may be terminated earlier by either party in some cases either in whole or on a product by product and or country by country and or indication by indication basis  based upon material breach or the commencement of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings involving the other  or by us upon sixty days notice to aeterna zentaris 
ortataxel in july  we entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement for ortataxel  a third generation taxane with indena spa in clinical studies  ortataxel has been shown to be bioavailable when administered orally to patients with solid tumors 
in addition  it belongs to a new generation of taxanes with the potential to be active against tumors resistant to paclitaxel bristol myers squibb s taxol and docetaxel sanofi aventis taxotere 
phase and studies in more than patients with solid tumors have shown activity in patients that were refractory to treatment with the available taxane drugs 
the safety profile of ortataxel is comparable to that of paclitaxel and docetaxel 
while optimizing the oral formulation for better bioavailability  we will consider future studies with the oral formulation 
the following describes the principal commercial terms relating to ortataxel licensing and development 
under the terms of the license agreement with indena  we are obligated to make payments based on the achievement of certain development  regulatory filing and sales milestones 
we will also pay indena certain royalties on worldwide sales of ortataxel  if and when the product is approved 
on october   we amended the agreement to extend payments of certain development and regulatory milestones 
also  we are obligated to purchase all of our requirements of ortataxel active pharmaceutical ingredient from indena 
lucanthone lucanthone is an orally administered small molecule which inhibits topoisomerase ii and ap endonuclease 
in preclinical tests  lucanthone was shown to enhance the sensitivity of animals to an anticancer agent in a time dependent and reversible manner 
lucanthone was originally used as an antiparasitic agent for the treatment of schistosomiasis in the s and s  and has a demonstrated safety profile 
it was later discontinued because better anti parasitic medications became available 
we are currently working on the development plan for lucanthone 
the following describes the principal commercial terms relating to lucanthone licensing and development 
we entered into a license agreement with dr 
robert e 
bases  the inventor of a method of treating cancer of the central nervous system through the administration of lucanthone and radiation  whereby we acquired worldwide exclusive rights to develop and commercialize a product based upon his invention in may under the terms of the license agreement  we made a small up front payment and are obligated to make additional periodic payments  a payment upon achievement of a certain regulatory milestone and royalties on potential net sales  if any 
spi spi is a highly selective peptide agonist of endothelin b receptors  which can stimulate receptors on endothelial cells  the innermost layer of cells lining the blood vessels 
this technology takes advantage of the fact that the blood supply to tumors is different than the blood supply to healthy organs 
blood vessels in the growing part of tumors are relatively devoid of smooth muscle covering and are rich in endothelial cells 
therefore  by stimulating the endothelial b receptors present on the endothelial cells  spi should selectively increase tumor blood flow while sparing healthy tissue 

table of contents chemotherapy is one of the mainstays of therapy for solid carcinomas  including breast  lung  and prostate 
chemotherapy uses drugs called cytotoxic agents that are poisonous to cells and kill cancer cells 
chemotherapy often fails because adequate and uniform distribution of the cytotoxic agents is not achieved in the tumor  and serious side effects can result from toxicity to normal cells 
consequently  any means to increase the delivery of a cytotoxic agent selectively to tumors  while minimizing its concentration in normal tissues may be beneficial 
spi is being developed as an adjunct to chemotherapy 
in pre clinical studies  when anti cancer drugs  such as paclitaxel  are administered shortly after spi  the anti cancer drug concentration in the tumor is increased several fold 
this results in increased anti tumor efficacy at a given dose of a cytotoxic agent  and might allow physicians to maximize efficacy with reduced cytotoxic agent doses with resultant decreased toxicity to the normal organs 
in the first quarter of  we initiated an open label  dose escalation phase study assessing the safety  tolerability  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of spi in patients with recurrent or progressive carcinoma 
we completed the phase study in and expect to begin phase in the second half of the following describes the principal commercial terms relating to spi licensing and development 
we acquired an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize spi for the prevention and treatment of cancer from chicago labs  inc in february we paid chicago labs a small up front fee and are obligated to make future payments contingent upon the successful achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones 
in addition  we will pay royalties and sales milestones on net sales  after marketing approval is obtained 
renazorb renazorb  or spi  a second generation lanthanum based nanoparticle phosphate binding agent  has the potential to treat hyperphosphatemia  high phosphate levels in blood  in patients with stage chronic kidney disease end stage renal disease 
hyperphosphatemia affects patients with chronic kidney disease  especially end stage kidney disease patients on dialysis 
it can lead to significant bone disease including pain and fractures and cardiovascular disease  and is independently associated with increased mortality 
according to the us renal data system in  there will be an estimated  patients with end stage renal disease in the us treatment of hyperphosphatemia is aimed at lowering blood phosphate levels by restricting dietary phosphorus intake  and using  on a daily basis  and with each meal  oral phosphate binding drugs that facilitate fecal elimination of dietary phosphate before its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract into the bloodstream 
restricting dietary phosphorus intake has historically not been a successful means of serum phosphate control  therefore phosphate binders are the mainstay of hyperphosphatemia management 
currently marketed therapies for treating hyperphosphatemia include polymer based and lanthanum based phosphate binders  aluminum based phosphate binders  and calcium based phosphate binders 
under the national kidney foundation k doqi guidelines  both calcium based phosphate binders and non calcium  non aluminum  non magnesium phosphate binders are recommended as first line or long term therapy for the management of hyperphosphatemia 
however  the current therapies require use of a large number of pills or large pills to be chewed or swallowed along with each meal  leading to problems with patient compliance with the treatment regimen 
we believe that renazorb has the opportunity  because of its potentially higher capacity for binding phosphate on an equal weight basis  to significantly improve patient compliance by offering the lowest in class dosage to achieve the same therapeutic benefit as other phosphate binders 
we filed an ind in and expect to begin a phase study in the first half of the following describes the principal commercial terms relating to renazorb licensing and development 
we entered into a license agreement with altair nanomaterials  inc and its parent altair nanotechnologies  inc  collectively referred to as altair  whereby we acquired an exclusive worldwide right to develop and commercialize renazorb for all human therapeutic and diagnostic uses in january under the terms of the license agreement  we made up front and milestone payments and are obligated to make additional payments upon achievement of certain clinical development and regulatory and sales milestones  in addition to royalties on potential net sales 

table of contents in august  we entered into an asset acquisition agreement with altair  in which we acquired of the rights to renazorb and all of altair s life science technology 
our acquisition of renazorb expands upon our prior license agreement with altair  pursuant to which altair granted us human uses 
our acquisition of renazorb provides us with access to all uses of and intellectual property for renazorb 
in consideration for the acquisition  we paid altair a total of  in the form of restricted shares of our common stock 
spi spi is a drug for the treatment of chemotherapy induced neutropenia 
in january we entered into a co development and commercialization agreement with hanmi pharmaceutical company hanmi for spi based on hanmi s proprietary lapscovery technology 
granulocyte colony stimulating factor gcsf stimulates the production of white blood cells by the bone marrow 
a recombinant form of gcsf is used in appropriate cancer patients to accelerate recovery from neutropenia after chemotherapy  allowing higher intensity treatment regimens to be given at full dose and on schedule 
chemotherapy can cause myelosuppression and unacceptably low levels of white blood cells  making patients prone to infections  hospitalizations  and interruption of additional chemotherapy treatments 
we believe the worldwide market for gcsf related drugs was over billion in manufacturing we currently do not have internal manufacturing capabilities  therefore  all of our products are manufactured on a contract basis 
we expect to continue to contract with third party providers for manufacturing services  including active pharmaceutical ingredient  or api  finished dosage product  as well as packaging operations 
we believe that our current agreements with third party manufacturers provide for sufficient operating capacity to support the anticipated commercial demand for our products 
however  we have only one approved contract manufacturer for each aspect of the manufacturing process for zevalin and have multiple contract manufacturers for fusilev 
if we are unable to obtain a sufficient supply of our required products  or if we should encounter delays or difficulties in our relationships with our manufacturers  we may lose potential sales 
we attempt to prevent disruption of supplies through supply agreements  appropriate forecasting  maintaining stock levels and other strategies 
we believe that the market for such manufacturers and suppliers is such that we could quickly enter into another supply or manufacturing agreement  on substantially similar terms  if we were required to do so 
however  in the event we are unable to manufacture our products  either directly or indirectly through others or on commercially acceptable terms  if at all  we may not be able to commercialize our products as planned 
although we are taking these actions to avoid a disruption in supply  we cannot provide assurance that we may not experience a disruption in the future 
sales  marketing and distribution we have built  and continue to develop  a sales and marketing infrastructure as part of our commercialization efforts for fusilev and zevalin 
while we maintain a relatively small sales force  we believe that the size of our sales force is appropriate to effectively reach our target audience for our two commercial products 
for fusilev  we have contracted with an independent contract sales organization to supplement our sales force 
we utilize a third party logistics company to store and distribute this drug product 
the same third party logistics company also stores and ships zevalin kits containing the cd mab 
for zevalin  we changed the supply and distribution model in previously  we sold zevalin kits containing the cd mab to radiopharmacies  who then in turn ordered the radioactive isotope y or in separately and radiolabeled or attached the radioactive isotope to the cd mab 
the radiopharmacy then sold the end user product to the consumer 
under the current model we do not sell the zevalin kits containing the cd mab to the radiopharmacies  but instead contract with them  as a fee for service  to radiolabel the individual components of the cd mab to the radioactive isotope  and then  also under a fee for service arrangement  have them distribute the end use product to the end user  which are clinics  hospitals or other medical settings 
in this regard  we now sell the cd mab together with the radioactive isotope as the end user product directly to the healthcare service provider 

table of contents customers our product sales are concentrated in a limited number of customers 
sales to customer a for the years ended december   and were  and respectively  of our total consolidated gross product sales 
sales to customer b for the year ended december  were of our total consolidated gross product sales 
no other single customer generated over of our consolidated gross product sales during the prior three fiscal years 
we are exposed to risks associated with extending credit to our customers related to the sale of products 
we do not require collateral or other security to support credit sales  however  we maintain reserves for potential bad debt and to date  credit losses have been within management s expectations 
customer a owed us and of net receivables as of december  and  respectively 
customer b owed us of net receivables as of december  no other single customer owed us more than of net receivables during the prior two fiscal years and all sales were to customers in the us competition the pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly evolving biotechnology and intense competition 
we expect biotechnological developments and improvements in the fields of our business to continue to occur at a rapid rate and  as a result  expect competition to remain intense 
many companies are engaged in research and development of compounds that are similar to our research 
biotechnologies under development by these and other pharmaceutical companies could result in treatments for the diseases and disorders for which we are developing our own treatments 
in the event that one or more of those programs are successful  the market for some of our drug products could be reduced or eliminated 
any product for which we obtain fda approval must also compete for market acceptance and market share 
competing in the branded product business requires us to identify and quickly bring to market new products embodying therapeutic innovations 
successful marketing of branded products depends primarily on the ability to communicate the effectiveness  safety and value of the products to healthcare professionals in private practice  group practices  hospitals and academic institutions  and managed care organizations 
competition for branded drugs is less driven by price and is more focused on innovation in treatment of disease  advanced drug delivery and specific clinical benefits over competitive drug therapies 
unless our products are shown to have a better safety profile  efficacy and cost effectiveness as compared to other alternatives  they may not gain acceptance by medical professionals and may therefore never be successful commercially 
companies that have products on the market or in research and development that target the same indications as our products target include  among others  abraxis bioscience  inc  astra zeneca lp  bayer ag  endo pharmaceuticals  eli lilly and co  novartis pharmaceuticals  corporation  genentech  inc roche  bristol myers squibb company  glaxosmithkline  biogen idec pharmaceuticals  inc  osi pharmaceuticals  inc astellas pharma  cephalon  inc 
teva pharmaceuticals  sanofi aventis  inc  pfizer  inc  genta incorporated  merck  celgene corporation  allos therapeutics  inc  bipar sciences  inc  genzyme corporation  shire pharmaceuticals  abbott laboratories  poniard pharmaceuticals  inc  roche pharmaceuticals and johnson johnson who may be more advanced in development of competing drug products or are more established and are currently marketing products for the treatment of various indications that our drug products target 
many of our competitors are large and well capitalized companies focusing on a wide range of diseases and drug indications  and have substantially greater financial  research and development  marketing  human and other resources than we do 
furthermore  large pharmaceutical companies have significantly more experience than we do in pre clinical testing  human clinical trials and regulatory approval procedures  among other things 
our proprietary product  fusilev  is the levo isomeric form of the racemic compound calcium leucovorin  a product already approved for the same indications our product is approved for 
leucovorin has been sold as a generic product on the market for a number of years 
there are three generic companies currently approved by the fda to sell the leucovorin product and therefore we are competing against a low cost alternative 
also  fusilev is offered as part of a treatment regimen  and that regimen may change to exclude fusilev 
for these reasons  we may not recognize the full potential value of our investment in the product 

table of contents regarding zevalin  there are three competitive products for its currently approved indications 
rituxan rituximab  marketed by genentech and biogen  is indicated for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory  low grade or follicular  cd positive  b cell nhl as a single agent  previously untreated follicular  cd positive  b cell nhl in combination with cvp cyclophosphamide  vincristine and prednisone combination chemotherapy  and non progressing including stable disease  low grade  cd positive b cell nhl  as a single agent  after first line cvp chemotherapy 
rituxan is administered as a part of various chemotherapy regimens and schedules  the vast majority of which  could be used in concert with other therapeutic agents  such as zevalin  as part of a treatment plan 
treanda bendamustine hydrochloride for injection  for intravenous infusion  marketed by cephalon  is indicated for the treatment of patients with indolent b cell nhl that has progressed during or within six months of treatment with rituximab or a rituximab containing regimen 
also  the bexxar therapeutic regimen tositumomab and iodine i tositumomab  a radiopharmaceutical marketed by glaxosmithkline  is indicated for the treatment of patients with cd antigen expressing relapsed or refractory  low grade  follicular  or transformed nhl  including patients with rituximab refractory nhl

research and development new drug development  which is the process whereby drug product candidates are tested for the purpose of filing an nda or a biologistics license application  or bla  or similar filing in other countries and eventually obtaining marketing approval from the fda or a similar marketing authorization from other regulatory authorities outside of the us  is an inherently uncertain  lengthy and expensive process that requires several phases of clinical trials to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the appropriate regulatory authorities that the products are both safe and effective for their respective indications 
our development focus is primarily based on acquiring and developing late stage development drugs as compared to new drug discovery  which is very uncertain and lengthy 
research and development expenses for such drug development are comprised of the following types of costs incurred in performing research and development activities personnel expenses  facility costs  contract services  license fees and milestone payments  costs of clinical trials  laboratory supplies and drug products  and allocations of corporate costs 
research and development expenditures  including related stock based charges but not including amortization of intangibles or expensing of in process research and development costs  are expensed as we incur them and were approximately million  million and million  respectively  in  and broken out by product as follows

in particular  we have licensed patent rights with respect to fusilev  zevalin  ozarelix  ortataxel  lucanthone  belinostat and spi  in each case for the remaining life of the applicable patents 
except for zevalin  fusilev  belinostat and ozarelix  our agreements generally provide us with exclusive worldwide rights to  among other things  develop  sublicense  and commercialize the drug products 
under most of these license arrangements  we are generally responsible for all development  patent filing and maintenance costs  sales  marketing and liability insurance costs related to the drug products 
in addition  these licenses and agreements may require us to make royalty and other payments and to reasonably exploit the underlying technology of applicable patents 
if we fail to comply with these and other terms in these licenses and agreements  we could lose the underlying rights to one or more of our potential products  which would adversely affect our product development and harm our business 
in addition  with regard to zevalin  apaziquone and renazorb  we own patent and other intellectual property rights related to these products 
the protection  preservation and infringement free commercial exploitation of these patents and related intellectual property rights are very important to the successful execution of our strategy 
however  the issuance of a patent is neither conclusive as to its validity nor as to the enforceable scope of the claims of the patent 
accordingly  our patents and the patents we have licensed may not prevent other companies from developing similar or functionally equivalent products or from successfully challenging the validity of our patents 
if our patent applications are not allowed or  even if allowed and issued as patents  if such patents or the patents we have in licensed  are circumvented or not upheld by the courts  our ability to competitively exploit our patented products and technologies may be significantly reduced 
also  such patents may or may not provide competitive advantages for their respective products or they may be challenged or circumvented by competitors  in which case our ability to commercially exploit these products may be diminished 
from time to time  we may need to obtain licenses to patents and other proprietary rights held by third parties to develop  manufacture and market our products 
if we are unable to timely obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms  our ability to commercially exploit such products may be inhibited or prevented 
as mentioned above  we own and in license from third parties certain patent rights related to our products 
we believe that our patents and licenses are important to our business  but that with the exception of the us and european patents discussed in this paragraph  no one patent or license is currently of material importance to our business 
for fusilev  we have one us composition of matter patent that covers fusilev that expires in for zevalin  we have sublicensed us patents that cover the processes and tools for making monoclonal anti bodies or mabs  in general  licensed us patents that cover the cd mab in zevalin as well as the use of zevalin to treat nhl  and acquired patents covering the zevalin compounding process ie  process of linking 
table of contents the cd mab to a radioactive isotope to make the patient ready dosage form of zevalin 
these patents expire over a wide range of dates beginning in  but the licensed patents covering the cd mab itself do not begin to expire until additionally  we have pending us patents covering the compounding process expiring in  and will consider filing more patent applications  if the opportunity arises 
for belinostat  there are composition of matter patents that cover belinostat and related compounds that do not begin to expire until currently  there are multiple us and foreign patent applications pending that cover belinostat formulations  uses and manufacturing and synthesis processes 
we plan to file additional us and foreign patent applications covering new formulations  uses and manufacturing and synthesis processes  where appropriate 
for apaziquone  there is a us formulation patent that does not expire until and method of treatment of bladder cancer using a stabilized formulation that does not expire until we have filed and plan to file additional us and foreign patent applications covering new formulations and or uses for this product 
for ozarelix  there is a us composition patent that will expire in  a formulation patent expiring in  and method of use patent applications on file in the us for ortataxel  there are two us composition patents that will expire in and multiple manufacturing and synthesis patents that do not begin to expire till  and the corresponding european patents will expire in we anticipate filing new method of use and formulation patent applications for the ortataxel product in the future 
there is one us patent covering satraplatin  a method of use patent expired in for lucanthone  there is a us method of use patent that expires in for renazorb  there is one method of use patent that expires in and pending us and foreign patent applications covering compositions of matter and methods directed to treating hyperphosphatemia 
for spi  we have filed method of use patent applications in the us and europe 
we also have multiple us method of use patents that expire in  and there is ongoing prosecution for their european counterparts 
we have also filed another method of use patent application in the us and europe and anticipate filing future patent applications pending the continued development of new methods of use and new formulations 
we are constantly evaluating our patent portfolio and are currently prosecuting patent applications for our drug products and are considering new patent applications in order to maximize the life cycle of each of our products 
while the us and the european union are currently the largest potential markets for most of our products  we also have patents issued and patent applications pending outside of the us and europe 
limitations on patent protection in these countries  and the differences in what constitutes patentable subject matter in countries outside the us  may limit the protection we have on patents issued or licensed to us outside of the us in addition  laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as would laws in the us to minimize our costs and expenses and to maintain effective protection  we usually focus our patent and licensing activities within the us  the european union  canada and japan 
in determining whether or not to seek a patent or to license any patent in a certain foreign country  we weigh the relevant costs and benefits  and consider  among other things  the market potential and profitability  the scope of patent protection afforded by the law of the jurisdiction and its enforceability  and the nature of terms with any potential licensees 
failure to obtain adequate patent protection for our proprietary drugs and technology would impair our ability to be commercially competitive in these markets 
in addition to the specific intellectual property subjects discussed above  we have trademark protection in the us for spectrum pharmaceuticals  inc  fusilev  spectrum therapy access resources  star  zevalin and renazorb 
additionally  for some other of these and other works related to our business  we have pending us and ex us trademark applications 
eoquin is a registered trademark of allergan 
in conducting our business generally  we rely upon trade secrets  know how  and licensing arrangements and use customary practices for the protection of our confidential and proprietary information such as confidentiality agreements and trade secret protection measures  such as periodic internal and external trade secret audits 
it is possible that these agreements will be breached or will not be enforceable in every instance  and that we will not have adequate remedies for any such breach 
it is also possible that our trade secrets or know how will otherwise become known or independently developed by competitors 
the protection of know how is particularly important because the know how is often the necessary or useful information that allows us to practice the claims in the patents related to our proprietary drug products 
we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to enforce our patent rights  to protect our trade secrets or know how or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
litigation concerning patents  trademarks  copyrights and proprietary technologies can often be protracted and expensive and  as with litigation generally  the outcome is inherently uncertain

table of contents the patent process the us constitution provides congress with the authority to provide inventors the exclusive right to their discoveries 
congress codified this right in us code title  which gave the us patent and trademark office  or uspto  the right to grant patents to inventors and defined the process for securing a us patent 
this process involves the filing of a patent application that teaches a person having ordinary skill in the respective art how to make and use the invention in clear and concise terms 
the invention must be novel not previously known and non obvious not an obvious extension of what is already known 
the patent application concludes with a series of claims that specifically describe the subject matter that the patent applicant considers his invention 
the uspto undertakes an examination process that can take from one to seven years  or more  depending on the complexity of the patent and the problems encountered during examination 
in exchange for disclosing the invention to the public  for all us patent applications filed after  the successful patent applicant is currently provided a right to exclude others from making  using or selling the claimed invention for a period of years from the effective filing date of the patent application 
under certain circumstances  a patent term may be extended 
patent extensions are most frequently granted in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries under the drug price competition and pricing term restoration act of  or hatch  or hatch waxman act  to recover some of the time lost during the fda regulatory process  subject to a number of limitations and exceptions 
the patent term may be extended up to a maximum of five years  however  as a general rule  the average extension period granted for a new drug is approximately three years 
only one patent can be extended per fda approved product  and a patent can only be extended once 
product exclusivity under the hatch waxman act  drug products are provided exclusivity whereby the fda will not accept applications to market a generic form of an innovator reference listed drug product until the end of the prescribed period 
a product is granted a five year period of exclusivity if it contains a chemical entity never previously approved by the fda either alone or in combination  although generic applications may be submitted after four years if they contain a certification of patent invalidity or non infringement as further discussed below 
a three year period of exclusivity is granted to a previously approved product based on certain changes  eg  in strength  dosage form  route of administration or conditions of use  where the application is supported by new clinical investigations that are essential to approval 
in addition  in congress amended the law to provide an additional six months of exclusivity as a reward for studying drugs in children 
this pediatric exclusivity  which can be obtained during the approval process or after approval  effectively delays the approval of a generic application until six months after the expiration of any patent or other exclusivity that would otherwise delay approval  thus providing an additional six months free of generic competition 
in order to qualify for pediatric exclusivity  the fda must make a written request for pediatric studies  the application holder must agree to the request and complete the studies with required timeframe  and the studies must be accepted by the fda based on a determination that the studies fairly respond to the request 
the provisions were enacted with a five year sunset date  and have been reauthorized in and the current provisions are set to expire in october  and congress is likely to consider reauthorizing the statute again 
generic approval and patent certification the hatch waxman act also created the abbreviated new drug application  or anda  approval process  which permits the approval of a generic version of a previously approved branded drug without the submission of a full new drug application  or nda  and based in part on the fda s finding of safety and effectiveness for the reference listed drug 
applicants submitting an nda are required to list patents associated with the drug product  which are published in the fda orange book  and the timing of an anda approval depends in part on patent protection for the branded drug 
when an anda is filed  the applicant must file a certification for each of the listed patents for the branded drug  stating one of the following that there is no patent information listed  that such patent has expired  that the patent will expire on a particular date indicating that the anda may be approved on that date  or that the drug for which approval is sought either does not infringe the patent or the patent is invalid  otherwise known as paragraph iv certification 
if an anda applicant files a paragraph certification  it is required to provide the patent holder with notice of that certification 
if the patent holder brings suit against the anda applicant for 
table of contents patent infringement within days of receiving notice  the fda may not approve the anda until the earlier of i months from the patent holder s receipt of the notice the month stay or ii the issuance of a final  non appealed  or non appealable court decision finding the patent invalid  unenforceable or not infringed 
the hatch waxman act also provided an incentive for generic manufacturers to file paragraph certifications challenging patents that may be invalid unenforceable  or not infringed  whereby the first company to successfully challenge a listed patent and receive anda approval is protected from competition from subsequent generic versions of the same drug product for days after the earlier of the date of the first commercial marketing of the first filed anda applicant s generic drug or the date of a decision of a court in an action holding the relevant patent invalid  unenforceable  or not infringed 
these day exclusivity provisions have been the subject of litigation and administrative review  and the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of  or mma  amended the provisions in several ways  including by providing that an anda applicant entitled to day exclusivity may lose such exclusivity if any of the following events occur failure to market  withdrawal of the anda  change in patent certification  failure to obtain tentative approval  illegal settlement agreement  and patent expiration 
with respect to the illegal settlement prong  the mma amendments require that certain types of settlement agreements entered into between branded and generic pharmaceutical companies related to the manufacture  marketing and sale of generic versions of branded drugs are required to be filed with the federal trade commission and the department of justice for review of potential anti competitive practices 
this requirement could affect the manner in which generic drug manufacturers resolve intellectual property litigation and other disputes with branded pharmaceutical companies  and could result generally in an increase in private party litigation against pharmaceutical companies 
the impact of this requirement  and the potential governmental investigations and private party lawsuits associated with arrangements between brand name and generic drug manufacturers  remains uncertain and could adversely affect our business 
in addition  congress has considered enacting legislation that would prohibit such settlements between brand name and generic drug manufacturers 
such a provision was considered as part of the recently enacted healthcare reform  the patient protection and affordable care act or ppaca  signed into law on march  however  congress removed the provision prior to passage 
it is possible that congress will again consider a ban on such settlements between brand name and generic drug manufacturers in the future 
with the passage of the ppaca  there are now exclusivity protections for certain innovator biological products and a framework for fda review and approval of biosimilar and interchangeable versions of innovator biologic products 
the ppaca provides that no application for a biosimilar product may be approved until years after the date on which the innovator product was first licensed  and no application may be submitted until four years after the date of first licensure 
products deemed interchangeable as opposed to biosimilar are also eligible for certain exclusivity

orphan drug designation some jurisdictions  including europe and the us  may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs 
the fda may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than  individuals in the us  and a drug may also be considered an orphan even if the drug treats a disease or condition affecting more than  individuals in the us where the drug has no expected profitability 
orphan drug designation does not necessarily convey any advantage in  or shorten the duration of  the regulatory review and process for marketing approval 
if a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first fda approval for the indication for which it has such designation  the product is entitled to seven years of orphan drug exclusivity  during which time fda will not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication except in limited circumstances  such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity 
also  competitors are not prohibited from receiving approval to market the same drug or biologic for a different indication than that which received orphan approval 

table of contents under european union medicines laws  the criteria for designating an orphan medicinal product are similar in principle to those in the us criteria for orphan designation are set out in article of regulation ec on the basis of two alternative conditions 
a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if it is intended for the diagnosis  prevention or treatment of a life threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in thousand persons in the european union  or eu  when the application is made 
this is commonly known as the disease prevalence criterion alternatively  a product may be so designated if it is intended for the diagnosis  prevention or treatment of a life threatening  seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the eu and if without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the product in the eu would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment 
this is commonly known as the insufficient return criterion 
these two alternative criteria must cumulatively meet the second condition that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis  prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the eu  or if such a method exists  the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition 
significant benefit is defined in regulation ec as a clinically relevant advantage or a major contribution to patient care 
upon grant of a marketing authorization  orphan medicinal products are entitled to ten years of market exclusivity in respect of the approved therapeutic indication 
within the period of market exclusivity  no competent authority in the eu is permitted to accept an application for marketing authorization  a variation or a line extension for the same approved therapeutic indication in respect of a similar medicinal product pursuant to article of regulation unless one of derogations set out in article of the same regulation applies 
in order to determine whether two products are considered similar  regulation requires an assessment of the principal molecular structure and the underlying mode of action 
any minor variation or modification of the principal molecular structure would not ordinarily render the second product dissimilar to the first authorized product 
in order for the second applicant to break the market exclusivity granted to the first authorized similar medicinal product in respect of the same therapeutic indication  the second applicant would principally rely upon data to demonstrate that his product is safer  more efficacious or clinically superior to the first product pursuant to article i of regulation ordinarily  such an assessment will require a head to head comparative clinical trial for the purpose of demonstrating clinical superiority 
the year market exclusivity may be reduced to years if at the end of the fifth year it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation on the basis of available evidence 
fusilev has been granted orphan drug designations for its use in conjunction with high dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma and for its use in combination chemotherapy with the approved agent fluorouracil in the palliative treatment of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon and rectum colorectal cancer 
in addition  belinostat has been granted an orphan drug designation for ptcl 
as discussed above  a drug with orphan designation status may obtain orphan exclusivity upon marketing approval under specified conditions set out in the applicable laws and regulations 
governmental regulation the development  production and marketing of our proprietary and generic drug and biologic products are subject to regulation for safety  efficacy and quality by numerous governmental authorities in the us and other countries 
in the us  drugs and biologics are subject to rigorous regulation 
the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act  as amended from time to time  and the regulations promulgated there under  as well as other federal and state statutes and regulations  govern  among other things  the development  approval  manufacture  safety  labeling  storage  record keeping  distribution  promotion  and advertising of our products 
product development and approval within this regulatory framework  including for drugs already at a clinical stage of development  can take many years and require the expenditure of substantial resources  and to obtain fda approval  a product must satisfy mandatory quality  safety and efficacy requirements 
in addition  each drug manufacturing establishment must be registered with the fda 
domestic manufacturing establishments must comply with the fda s current good manufacturing practice  or gmp  regulations and are subject to inspections by the fda 
to supply drug ingredients or products for use in the us  foreign manufacturing establishments must also comply with gmp and are subject to inspections by the fda or by other regulatory authorities in certain countries under reciprocal agreements with the fda 

table of contents general information about the drug approval process and post marketing requirements the us system of new drug and biologics approval is a rigorous process 
only a small percentage of compounds that enter the pre clinical testing stage are ever approved for commercialization 
our strategy focuses on in licensing clinical stage drug products that are already in or about to enter human clinical trials 
a late stage focus helps us to effectively manage the high cost of drug development by focusing on compounds that have already passed the many hurdles in the pre clinical and early clinical process 
the following general comments about the drug approval process are relevant to the development activities we are undertaking with our proprietary products 
pre clinical testing during the pre clinical testing stage  laboratory and animal studies are conducted to show biological activity of a drug or biologic compound against the targeted disease 
the compound is evaluated for safety 
investigational new drug application after certain pre clinical studies are completed  an investigational new drug  or ind  application is submitted to the fda to request the ability to begin human testing of the drug or biologic 
an ind becomes effective thirty days after the fda receives the application unless the fda notifies the sponsor of a clinical hold  or upon prior notification by the fda 
phase clinical trials these trials  typically involving small numbers of healthy volunteers or patients  usually define a drug candidate s safety profile  including the safe dosage range 
phase clinical trials in phase clinical trials  controlled studies of human patients with the targeted disease are conducted to assess the drug s effectiveness 
these studies are designed primarily to determine the appropriate dose levels  dose schedules and route s of administration  and to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug or biologic on humans  as well as to determine if there are any side effects on humans to expand the safety profile following phase these clinical trials  and phase trials discussed below  are designed to evaluate the product s overall benefit risk profile  and to provide information for physician labeling 
phase clinical trials this phase usually involves larger number of patients with the targeted disease 
investigators typically physicians monitor the patients to determine the drug candidate s efficacy and to observe and report any adverse reactions that may result from long term use of the drug on a large  more widespread  patient population 
during the phase clinical trials  typically the drug candidate is compared to either a placebo or a standard treatment for the target disease 
new drug application or biologic license application after completion of all three clinical trial phases  if the data indicates that the drug is safe and effective  a nda or bla is filed with the fda requesting fda approval to market the new drug as a treatment for the target disease 
fast track and priority review the fda has established procedures for accelerating the approval of drugs to be marketed for serious or life threatening diseases for which the manufacturer can demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs 
abbreviated new drug application an anda is an abbreviated new drug application for generic drugs created by the hatch waxman act 
when a company files an anda  it must make a patent certification regarding the patents covering the branded product listed in the fda s orange book 
the anda drug development process generally takes less time than the nda drug development process since the anda process usually does not require new clinical trials establishing the safety and efficacy of the drug product 
nda bla and anda approval the fda approves drugs and biologics that are subject to nda and bla review based on data in the application demonstrating the product is safe and effective in its proposed use s and that the product s benefits outweigh its risks 
fda will also review the nda or bla applicant s manufacturing process and controls to ensure they are adequate to preserve the drug s identity  strength  quality  and purity 
finally  the fda will review and approve the product s proposed labeling 
as for the anda approval process  these abbreviated applications are generally not required to include preclinical or clinical data to establish safety and effectiveness 
rather  an anda must demonstrate both chemical equivalence and bio equivalence the rate and extent of absorption in the body to the innovator drug unless a bio equivalence waiver is granted by the fda 

table of contents phase clinical trials after a drug has been approved by the fda  phase studies may be conducted to explore additional patient populations  compare the drug to a competitor  or to further study the risks  benefits and optimal use of a drug 
these studies may be a requirement as a condition of the initial approval of the nda or bla 
post approval studies requirements under fdaaa the food and drug administration amendments act of  or fdaaa  which was signed into law in september  significantly added to the fda s authority to require post approval studies 
under the fdaaa  if the fda becomes aware of new safety information after approval of a product  they may require us to conduct further clinical trials to assess a known serious risk  signals of serious risk or to identify an unexpected serious risk 
if required to conduct a post approval study  periodic status reports must be submitted to the fda 
failure to conduct such post approval studies in a timely manner may result in administrative action being taken by fda  including substantial civil fines 
risk evaluation and mitigation strategy authority under fdaaa the fdaaa also gave the fda new authority to require the implementation of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy  or rems  for a product when necessary to minimize known and preventable safety risks associated with the product 
the fda may require the submission of a rems before a product is approved  or after approval based on new safety information  including new analyses of existing safety information 
a rems may include a medication guide  patient package insert  a plan for communication with healthcare providers  or other elements as the fda deems are necessary to assure safe use of the product  which could include imposing certain restrictions on distribution or use of a product 
a rems must include a timetable for submission of assessments of the strategy at specified time intervals 
failure to comply with a rems  including the submission of a required assessment  may result in substantial civil or criminal penalties 
other issues related to product safety adverse events that are reported after marketing approval also can result in additional limitations being placed on a product s use and  potentially  withdrawal of the product from the market 
in addition  under the fdaaa  the fda has authority to mandate labeling changes to products at any point in a product s lifecycle based on new safety information derived from clinical trials  post approval studies  peer reviewed medical literature  or post market risk identification and analysis systems data 
fda enforcement the development of drug and biologic products  as well as the marketing of approved drugs and biologics  is subject to substantial continuing regulation by the fda  including regulation of adverse event reporting  manufacturing practices and the advertising and promotion of the product 
failure to comply with the fda and other governmental regulations can result in fines  unanticipated compliance expenditures  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production and or distribution  suspension of the fda s review of ndas  blas  andas or other product applications  enforcement actions  injunctions and criminal prosecution 
under certain circumstances  the fda also has the authority to revoke previously granted drug approvals 
although we have internal compliance programs  if these programs do not meet regulatory agency standards or if our compliance is deemed deficient in any significant way  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
see item a risks factors our failure to comply with governmental regulation may delay or prevent approval of our products and or subject us to penalties 
with respect specifically to information submitted to fda in support of marketing applications  the fda  under its fraud  untrue statements of material facts  bribery and illegal gratuities policy  can significantly delay the approval of a marketing application  or seek to withdraw an approved application where it identifies fraud or discrepancies in regulatory submissions 
such actions by the fda may significantly delay or suspend substantive scientific review of a pending application during validity assessment or remove approved products from the market until the assessment is complete and questions regarding reliability of the data are resolved 
in addition  the generic drug enforcement act of established penalties for wrongdoing in connection with the development or submission of an anda 
under this act  the fda has the authority to permanently or temporarily bar companies or individuals from submitting or assisting in the submission of an anda  and to temporarily deny approval and suspend applications to market generic drugs 
the fda may also suspend the distribution of all drugs approved or developed in connection with certain wrongful conduct and or withdraw approval of an anda and seek civil penalties 

table of contents healthcare reform continuing studies of the proper utilization  safety and efficacy of pharmaceuticals and other health care products are being conducted by industry  government agencies and others 
such studies  which increasingly employ sophisticated methods and techniques  can call into question the utilization  safety and efficacy of previously marketed products and in some cases have resulted  and may in the future result  in the discontinuance of their marketing 
the patient centered outcomes research institute  a private  non profit corporation created as a result of the ppaca  is tasked with assisting patients  clinician  purchasers  and policy makers in making informed health decisions 
one of the institute s initiatives will be to conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research  which is defined as research evaluating and comparing health outcomes and the clinical effectiveness  risks  and benefits of or more medical treatments  services  and items 
it is important to note that the institute would not be permitted to mandate coverage  reimbursement  or other policies for any public or private payer  however the outcome of the institute s initiatives could influence prescriber behavior 
foreign regulation whether or not we obtain fda approval for a product  we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries 
the approval process varies from country region to country region  and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval 
the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials  product licensing  pricing and reimbursement also may vary  sometimes significantly  from country region to country region 
under the eu regulatory systems  we may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized procedure or decentralized procedure or the mutual recognition procedure 
the centralized procedure is mandatory for medicines produced by a biotechnological process 
the procedure is also mandatory for new active substances which are indicated for treatment of several diseases or conditions  including cancer and orphan conditions 
companies may apply for centralized assessment if the product contains a new active substance or the product constitutes significant therapeutic  scientific or technical innovation or the granting of authorization under the centralized procedure is in the interests of the eu patients 
a centralized marketing authorization is valid in all european union member states 
this marketing authorization is issued in the form of a european commission decision which is legally binding in its entirety to which it is addressed 
directive ec introduced two parallel procedures to the centralized procedure to allow a product to be progressively authorized in each of the member states of the eu 
they are the decentralized procedure and the mutual recognition procedure 
the mutual recognition procedure applies where the product has already been authorized in a member state of the eu that will act as reference member state 
the national marketing authorization granted by the reference member state forms the basis for mutual recognition in the member states chosen by the applicant 
in the decentralized procedure  the product in question is not authorized in any one the eu member states 
in such a situation  the applicant company will request a member state to act as the reference member state to lead the scientific assessment for the benefit risk balance for agreement by the concerned member states 
in both cases  the concerned member states have up to days to accept or raise reasoned objections to the assessment made by the reference member state 
in addition  pricing and reimbursement is subject to negotiation and regulation in most countries outside the us increasingly  adoption of a new product for use in national health services is subject to health technology assessment under the national rules and regulations to establish the clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of a new treatment 
in some countries  in order to contain health care expenditures  reference price is introduced in order for the national healthcare providers to achieve a price comparable to the reference price in the same therapeutic category 
we may therefore face the risk that the resulting prices would be insufficient to generate an acceptable return to us 

table of contents third party reimbursement and pricing controls in the us and elsewhere  sales of pharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the availability of reimbursement to the consumer from third party payers  such as government and private insurance plans 
third party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
it is time consuming and expensive for us to go through the process of seeking reimbursement from medicare and private payers 
our products may not be considered cost effective  and coverage and reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis 
the ppaca enacted significant reforms  including revising the definition of average manufacturer price for reporting purposes  increasing medicaid rebates  expanding the b drug discount program  and making changes to affect the medicare part d coverage gap  or donut hole 
in the coming years  additional significant changes could be made to governmental healthcare programs  and the us healthcare system as a whole  that may result in significantly increased rebates  decreased pricing flexibility  diminished negotiating flexibility  coverage and reimbursement limitations based upon comparative and cost effectiveness reviews  and other measures that could significantly impact the success of our products 
in many foreign markets  including the countries in the eu  pricing of pharmaceutical products is subject to governmental control 
in the us  there have been  and we expect that there will continue to be  a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar governmental pricing control 
while we cannot predict whether such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted  the adoption of such proposals could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and profitability 
employees the efforts of our employees are critical to our success 
we believe that we have assembled a strong management team with the experience and expertise needed to execute our business strategy 
we anticipate hiring additional personnel as needs dictate to implement our growth strategy 
as of december   we had employees  of which held a md degree and held a phd degree 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel in sufficient numbers to meet our needs 
our employees are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements  and we regard our relations with our employees to be good
