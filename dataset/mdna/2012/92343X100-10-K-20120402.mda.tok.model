item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with business under item  selected financial data under item  and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included in item of this report 
this discussion contains a number of forward looking statements  all of which are based on our current expectations and all of which could be affected by uncertainties and risks 
our actual results may differ materially from the results contemplated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors including  but not limited to  those described in risk factors under item a

verint was founded in and is headquartered in melville  new york 
our business we serve two markets through three operating segments 
our enterprise intelligence segment serves the enterprise intelligence market  while our video intelligence segment and communications intelligence segment serve the security intelligence market 
in our enterprise intelligence segment  we are a leading provider of enterprise intelligence software and services 
our solutions enable organizations to extract and analyze valuable information from customer interactions and related operational data in order to make more effective  proactive decisions for optimizing the performance of their customer service operations  improving the customer experience  and facilitating compliance  and enhancing products and services 
for the years ended january    and  this segment represented approximately   and of our total revenue  respectively 
in our video intelligence segment  we are a leading provider of networked ip video solutions and a provider of situation intelligence solutions designed to optimize security and enhance operations 
our video intelligence solutions portfolio includes ip video 
table of contents management software and services  edge devices for capturing  digitizing  and transmitting video over different types of wired and wireless networks  video analytics  networked video recorders  and physical security information management 
for the years ended january    and  this segment represented approximately   and of our total revenue  respectively 
in our communications intelligence segment  we are a leading provider of communications intelligence solutions and a developer of cyber intelligence solutions that help law enforcement  national security  intelligence  and civilian government agencies effectively detect  investigate  and neutralize criminal and terrorist threats and detect and thwart cyber attacks 
our solutions are designed to handle massive amounts of unstructured and structured information from different sources  quickly make sense of complex scenarios  and generate evidence and intelligence 
for the years ended january    and  this segment represented approximately   and of our total revenue  respectively 
generally  we make business decisions by evaluating the risks and rewards of the opportunities available to us in the markets served by each of our segments 
we view each operating segment differently and allocate capital  personnel  resources  and management attention accordingly 
in reviewing each operating segment  we also review the performance of that segment by geography 
our marketing and sales strategies  expansion opportunities  and product offerings may differ materially within a particular segment geographically  as may our allocation of resources between segments 
when making decisions regarding investment in our business  increasing capital expenditures or making other decisions that may reduce our profitability  we also consider the leverage ratio in our credit facility 
see liquidity and capital resources for more information 
key trends and developments in our business we believe that there are many factors that affect our ability to sustain and increase both revenue and profitability  including market acceptance of actionable intelligence for unstructured data  particularly analytics 
we are in an early stage market where the value of certain aspects of our products and solutions is still in the process of market acceptance 
we believe that our future growth depends in part on the continued and increasing acceptance of the value of our data analytics across our product offerings 
our capital structure may impact our financing activities  investments  and growth 
we have a majority stockholder that can effectively control our business and affairs 
we also are subject to various restrictive covenants under our credit facility  as well as a leverage ratio financial covenant 
as a result  our current capital structure limits our ability to issue equity  incur additional debt  engage in mergers or acquisitions  or make certain investments in our business 
these limitations may impede our ability to execute upon our business strategy 
information technology spending 
our growth and results depend in part on general economic conditions and the pace of growth in information technology spending 

table of contents see also risk factors under item a for a more complete description of these and other risks that may impact future revenue and profitability 
our previous extended filing delay and related matters as previously disclosed  from march through march  we did not make periodic filings with the sec 
our previous extended filing delay arose as a result of certain internal and external investigations and reviews of accounting matters discussed in our prior public filings and led to the identification of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and the delisting of our common stock from nasdaq 
in connection with the foregoing and related matters  we incurred approximately million of professional fees and related expenses during the four years ended january  by june  we had concluded our internal investigation and reviews  filed with the sec annual reports for all required periods and quarterly reports for certain quarters for which we had not previously filed reports  resumed making timely periodic filings with the sec  relisted our common stock on nasdaq  settled an injunctive action by the sec  and resolved certain other matters with the sec 
as a result  professional fees incurred during the year ended january  were significantly lower than those incurred in each of the four years ended january  we expect future professional fees and related expenses to continue to be significantly lower than those incurred during our previous extended filing delay 
critical accounting policies and estimates an appreciation of our critical accounting policies is necessary to understand our financial results 
the accounting policies outlined below are considered to be critical because they can materially affect our operating results and financial condition  as these policies may require management to make difficult and subjective judgments regarding uncertainties 
the accuracy of these estimates and the likelihood of future changes depend on a range of possible outcomes and a number of underlying variables  many of which are beyond our control  and there can be no assurance that our estimates are accurate 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy is a critical component of determining our operating results and is based on a complex set of accounting rules that require us to make significant judgments and estimates 
we derive revenue primarily from two sources product revenue  which includes revenue from hardware and software products  and service and support revenue  which includes revenue from installation services  pcs  project management  hosting services  saas  product warranties  and training services 
our customer arrangements may include any combination of these elements 
we follow the appropriate revenue recognition rules for each type of revenue 
for additional information  see note  summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
revenue recognition for a particular arrangement is dependent upon such factors as the level of customization within the solution and the contractual delivery  acceptance  payment  and support terms with the customer 
significant judgment is required to conclude on each of these factors  and if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments  it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 

table of contents we generally consider a purchase order or executed sales quote  when combined with a master license agreement  to constitute evidence of an arrangement 
delivery occurs when the product is shipped or transmitted and title and risk of loss have transferred to the customers 
our typical customer arrangements do not include products acceptance provisions  however  if such provisions are provided  delivery is deemed to occur upon acceptance 
we consider the fee to be fixed or determinable unless the fee is subject to refund or adjustment or is not payable within our standard payment terms 
in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued amended revenue recognition accounting standards that removed tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality from the scope of industry specific software revenue recognition guidance 
also in october  the fasb amended the accounting standards for many multiple deliverable revenue arrangements to i provide updated guidance on when and how the deliverables in a multiple deliverable arrangement should be separated  and how the consideration should be allocated  ii require an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement that has separate units of accounting  using estimated selling prices esp of deliverables if a vendor does not have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price  or third party evidence of selling price tpe  and iii eliminate the use of the residual method and require an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method to the separate units of accounting 
we elected to prospectively adopt the provisions of this new guidance as of february   for new and materially modified transactions entered into on or after that date 
since we have been able to establish vsoe for a significant amount of our service and support offerings included in multiple element arrangements  we do not consider the impact of implementing the guidance to be significant for the year ended january  for the year ended january   we recognized million and million of additional revenue and additional income before provision for income taxes  respectively  as a result of adopting the new guidance 
our multiple element arrangements consist of a combination of our product and service offerings that may be delivered at various points in time 
for arrangements within the scope of the new revenue accounting guidance  a deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has stand alone value and there are no customer negotiated refunds or return rights for the delivered elements 
for multiple element arrangements comprised only of hardware products and related services  we allocate revenue to each element in an arrangement based on a selling price hierarchy 
the selling price for a deliverable is based on its vsoe  if available  tpe  if vsoe is not available  or esp  if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
the total transaction revenue is allocated to the multiple elements based on each element s relative selling price compared to the total selling price 

table of contents the manner in which we account for multiple element arrangements that contain only software and software related elements remains unchanged by the new guidance 
we allocate a portion of the total purchase price to the undelivered elements  primarily installation services  pcs  and training  using vsoe of fair value of the undelivered elements 
the remaining portion of the total transaction value is allocated to the delivered software  referred to as the residual method 
if we are unable to establish vsoe for the undelivered elements of the arrangement  revenue recognition is deferred for the entire arrangement until all elements of the arrangement are delivered 
however  if the only undelivered element is pcs  we recognize the arrangement fee ratably over the pcs period 
for new or materially modified multiple element arrangements entered into on or after february  that are comprised of a combination of hardware and software elements  the total transaction value is bifurcated between the hardware elements and the software elements that are not essential to the functionality of the hardware  based on the relative selling prices of the hardware elements and the software elements as a group 
revenue is then recognized for the hardware and hardware related services following the hardware revenue recognition methodology outlined above and revenue for the software and software related services is recognized following the residual method or ratably over the pcs period if vsoe for pcs does not exist 
our policy for establishing vsoe for installation  consulting  and training is based upon an analysis of separate sales of services 
we utilize either the substantive renewal rate approach or the bell shaped curve approach to establish vsoe for our pcs offerings  depending upon the business segment  geographical region  or product line 
the timing of revenue recognition on software licenses and other revenue could be significantly impacted if we are unable to maintain vsoe on one or more undelivered elements during any quarterly period 
loss of vsoe could result in i the complete deferral of all revenue or ii ratable recognition of all revenue under a customer arrangement until such time as vsoe is re established 
if we are unable to re establish vsoe on one or more undelivered elements for an extended period of time it would impact our ability to accurately forecast the timing of quarterly revenue  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we typically are not able to determine tpe for our products or our service and support offerings 
tpe of selling price is established by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in stand alone sales to similarly situated customers 
if we are unable to determine the selling price because vsoe or tpe does not exist  we determine esp for the purposes of allocating the arrangement by considering several external and internal factors including  but not limited to  pricing practices  similar product offerings  margin objectives  geographies in which we offer our products and services  internal costs  competition  and product lifecycle 
the determination of esp is made through consultation with and approval by our management  taking into consideration our go to market strategies 
esp for each element is updated  when appropriate  to ensure that it reflects recent pricing experience 
pcs revenue is derived from providing technical software support services and software updates and upgrades to customers on a when and if available basis 
pcs revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance period which  in most cases  is one 
table of contents year 
when pcs is included within a multiple element arrangement  we utilize either the substantive renewal rate approach or the bell shaped curve approach to establish vsoe of the pcs  depending upon the business operating segment  geographical region  or product line 
under the substantive renewal rate approach  we believe it is necessary to evaluate whether both the support renewal rate and term are substantive  and whether the renewal rate is being consistently applied to subsequent renewals for a particular customer 
we establish vsoe under this approach through analyzing the renewal rate stated in the customer agreement and determining whether that rate is above the minimum substantive vsoe renewal rate established for that particular pcs offering 
the minimum substantive vsoe rate is determined based upon an analysis of revenue associated with historical pcs contracts 
typically  renewal rates of for pcs plans that provide when and if available upgrades  and for plans that do not provide for when and if available upgrades  would be deemed to be minimum substantive renewal rates 
for contracts that do not contain a stated renewal rate  revenue associated with the entire bundled arrangement is recognized ratably over the pcs term 
contracts that have a renewal rate below the minimum substantive vsoe rate are deemed to contain a more than insignificant discount element  for which vsoe cannot be established 
we recognize revenue for these arrangements over the period that the customer is entitled to renew their pcs at the discounted rate  but not to exceed the estimated economic life of the product 
under the bell shaped curve approach of establishing vsoe  we perform a vsoe compliance test to ensure that a substantial majority or over of our actual pcs renewals are within a narrow range of plus or minus of the median pricing 
some of our arrangements require significant customization of the product to meet the particular requirements of the customer 
for these arrangements  revenue is recognized under contract accounting methods  typically using the percentage of completion poc method 
under the poc method  revenue recognition is generally based upon the ratio of hours incurred to date to the total estimated hours required to complete the contract 
profit estimates on long term contracts are revised periodically based on changes in circumstances  and any losses on contracts are recognized in the period that such losses become evident 
generally  the terms of long term contracts provide for progress billings based on completion of milestones or other defined phases of work 
significant judgment is often required when estimating total hours and progress to completion on these arrangements  as well as whether a loss is expected to be incurred on the contract due to several factors including the degree of customization required and the customer s existing environment 
we use historical experience  project plans  and an assessment of the risks and uncertainties inherent in the arrangement to establish these estimates 
uncertainties in these arrangements include implementation delays or performance issues that may or may not be within our control 
we extend customary trade payment terms to our customers in the normal course of conducting business 
to assess the probability of collection for purposes of revenue recognition  we have established credit policies that establish prudent credit limits for our customers 
these credit limits are based upon our risk assessment of the customer s ability to pay  their payment history  geographic risk  and other factors  and are not contingent upon the resale of the product or upon the collection of payments from their customers 
these credit limits are reviewed and revised periodically on the basis of updated customer financial statement information  payment performance  and other factors 

table of contents we record provisions for estimated product returns in the same period in which the associated revenue is recognized 
we base these estimates of product returns upon historical levels of sales returns and other known factors 
actual product returns could be different from our estimates and current or future provisions for product returns may differ from historical provisions 
concessions granted to customers are recorded as reductions to revenue in the period in which they were granted and have been minimal in both amount and frequency 
product revenue derived from shipments to resellers and oems who purchase our products for resale are generally recognized when such products are shipped on a sell in basis 
this policy is predicated on our ability to estimate sales returns as well as other criteria regarding these customers 
we are also required to evaluate whether our resellers and oems have the ability to honor their commitment to make fixed or determinable payments regardless of whether they collect payment from their customers 
in this regard  we assess whether our resellers and oems are new  poorly capitalized  or experiencing financial difficulty  and whether they have a pattern of not paying as amounts become due on previous arrangements or seeking payment terms longer than those provided to end customers 
if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments  it could cause a material change to the revenue reported in a particular period 
we have historically experienced insignificant product returns from resellers and oems  and our payment terms for these customers are similar to those granted to our end users 
our policy also presumes that we have no significant performance obligations in connection with the sale of our products by our resellers and oems to their customers 
if a reseller or oem develops a pattern of payment delinquency  or seeks payment terms longer than generally granted to our resellers or oems  we defer the recognition of revenue from transactions with that reseller or oem until the receipt of cash 
for multiple element arrangements that contain software and software related elements for which we are unable to establish vsoe of one or more elements  we use various available indicators of fair value and apply our best judgment to reasonably classify the arrangement s revenue into product revenue and service revenue for financial reporting purposes 
installation services associated with our communications intelligence arrangements are included within product revenue as such amounts are not considered material 
allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate the collectability of our accounts receivable balances each accounting period and adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts accordingly 
we exercise a considerable amount of judgment in assessing the collectability of accounts receivable  including consideration of the creditworthiness of each customer  their collection history  and the related aging of past due receivables balances 
we evaluate specific accounts when we learn that a customer may be experiencing a deterioration of its financial condition due to lower credit ratings  bankruptcy  or other factors that may affect its ability to render payment 
accounting for business combinations we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired  including in process research and development assets  and liabilities assumed  based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date 
these fair values are 
table of contents typically estimated with assistance from independent valuation specialists 
the purchase price allocation process requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets  contractual support obligations assumed  and pre acquisition contingencies 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from software license sales  support agreements  consulting contracts  other customer contracts  and acquired developed technologies  expected costs to develop in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s brand and competitive position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  cost of capital and discount rates  and estimating the useful lives of acquired assets as well as the pattern or manner in which the assets will amortize 
in connection with the purchase price allocations for applicable acquisitions  we estimate the fair value of the contractual support obligations we are assuming from the acquired business 
the estimated fair value of the support obligations is determined utilizing a cost build up approach  which determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a reasonable profit margin 
the estimated costs to fulfill the support obligations are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the support services 
the sum of these costs and operating profit represents an approximation of the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the support obligations 

table of contents impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets we perform our goodwill impairment test on an annual basis  as of november  or more frequently if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that impairment in the value of goodwill may exist 
we review goodwill for impairment utilizing either a qualitative assessment or a two step process 
if we decide that it is appropriate to perform a qualitative assessment and conclude that the fair value of a reporting unit more likely than not exceeds its carrying value  no further evaluation is necessary 
for reporting units where we perform the two step process  the first step requires us to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit and compare that fair value to the respective carrying value  which includes goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  the goodwill is not considered impaired and no further evaluation is necessary 
if the carrying value is higher than the estimated fair value  there is an indication that impairment may exist and the second step is required 
in the second step  the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated as the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the fair values assigned to its assets and liabilities 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill  the difference is recognized as an impairment charge 
for reporting units where we decide to perform a qualitative assessment  our management assesses and makes judgments regarding a variety of factors which potentially impact the fair value of a reporting unit  including general economic conditions  industry and market specific conditions  customer behavior  cost factors  our financial performance and trends  our strategies and business plans  capital requirements  management and personnel issues  and our stock price  among others 
management then considers the totality of these and other factors  placing more weight on the events and circumstances that are judged to most affect a reporting unit s fair value or the carrying amount of its net assets  to reach a qualitative conclusion regarding whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount 
for reporting units where we perform the two step process  we utilize three primary approaches to assess fair value a an income based approach  using projected discounted cash flows  b a market based approach  using multiples of comparable companies  and c a transaction based approach  using multiples for recent acquisitions of similar businesses made in the marketplace 
our estimate of fair value of each reporting unit is based on a number of subjective factors  including a appropriate consideration of valuation approaches income approach  comparable public company approach  and comparable transaction approach  b estimates of our future cost structure  c discount rates for our estimated cash flows  d selection of peer group companies for the comparable public company and the comparable transaction approaches  e required levels of working capital  f assumed terminal value  and g time horizon of cash flow forecasts 
the determination of reporting units also requires management judgment 
we assess whether a reporting unit exists within a reportable segment by identifying the unit  determining whether the unit qualifies as a business under gaap  and assessing the availability and regular review by segment management of discrete financial information for the unit 

table of contents we review intangible assets that have finite useful lives and other long lived assets when an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment 
if any indicators are present  we perform a recoverability test by comparing the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets in question to their carrying amounts 
if the undiscounted cash flows used in the test for recoverability are less than the long lived assets carrying amount  we determine the fair value of the long lived asset and recognize an impairment loss if the carrying amount of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
we did not record any impairments of goodwill for the years ended january   or  as the fair values of all of our reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying values 
since the estimated fair values of our reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying values as of november   and no indicators of potential impairment were identified between november  and january   we currently do not believe that our reporting units are at risk of impairment 
the assumptions and estimates used in this process are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts 
although we believe the assumptions  judgments  and estimates we have used in our assessments are reasonable and appropriate  a material change in any of our assumptions or external factors could lead to future goodwill or other intangible asset impairment charges 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method which includes the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in our consolidated financial statements 
under this approach  deferred taxes are recorded for the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid 
the provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus deferred taxes 
deferred taxes result from differences between the financial statement and tax bases of our assets and liabilities  and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted 
the effects of future changes in income tax laws or rates are not anticipated 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
the calculation of our tax provision involves the application of complex tax laws and requires significant judgment and estimates 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets for each jurisdiction in which we operate at each reporting date  and we establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income of the same character and in the same jurisdiction 
we consider all available positive and negative evidence in making this assessment  including  but not limited to  the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies 
in circumstances where 
table of contents there is sufficient negative evidence indicating that our deferred tax assets are not more likely than not realizable  we establish a valuation allowance 
we use a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by assessing whether they are more likely than not sustainable  based solely on their technical merits  upon examination  and including resolution of any related appeals or litigation process 
the second step is to measure the associated tax benefit of each position as the largest amount that we believe is more likely than not realizable 
differences between the amount of tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in our income tax returns and the amount of tax benefits recognized in our financial statements represent our unrecognized income tax benefits  which we either record as a liability or as a reduction of deferred tax assets 
our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized income tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 
contingencies we recognize an estimated loss from a claim or loss contingency when and if information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for claims and contingencies requires the use of significant judgment and estimates 
one notable potential source of loss contingencies is pending or threatened litigation 
legal counsel and other advisors and experts are consulted on issues related to litigation as well as on matters related to contingencies occurring in the ordinary course of business 
accounting for stock based compensation we recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
we estimate the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
we use the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the input of significant assumptions including an estimate of the average period of time employees will retain stock options before exercising them  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term  the number of options that will ultimately be forfeited before completing vesting requirements  and the risk free interest rate 
changes in the assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and  consequently  the related expense recognized 
the assumptions we use in calculating the fair value of stock based payment awards represent our best estimates  which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
cost of revenue we have made an accounting policy election whereby the product cost of revenue  including hardware and third party software license fees  are capitalized and amortized over the same period that product revenue is recognized  while installation and other service costs are generally expensed as incurred  except for certain contracts recognized according to contract accounting 

table of contents for example  in a multiple element arrangement where revenue is recognized over the pcs support period  the cost of revenue associated with the product is capitalized upon product delivery and amortized over that same period 
however  the cost of revenue associated with the services is expensed as incurred in the period in which the services are performed 
in addition  we expense customer acquisition and origination costs to selling  general and administrative expense  including sales commissions  as incurred  with the exception of certain sales referral fees in our communications intelligence segment which are capitalized and amortized ratably over the revenue recognition period 
results of operations financial overview the following table sets forth a summary of certain key financial information for the years ended january    and year ended january  in thousands  except per share data revenue operating income net income attributable to verint systems inc common shares net income per common share attributable to verint systems inc basic diluted year ended january  compared to year ended january  our revenue increased approximately  or million  to million in the year ended january  from million in the year ended january  in our enterprise intelligence segment  revenue increased million  or 
the increase was primarily due to a million increase in service revenue due primarily to an increase in our customer install base and the related support revenue generated from this customer base during the year ended january  and  to a lesser extent  acquisitions in our enterprise intelligence segment during the year ended january  primarily vovici 
we continue to see expansion of our implementation services revenue due to the growth of our professional services organization to meet the demands of our customer base 
the increase in service revenue was partially offset by a million decrease in product revenue  which relates to a large transaction whereby product delivery occurred in the year ended january  but a significant portion of the product revenue was not able to be recognized in the year ended january  due to certain contractual terms which required the remaining product revenue to be recognized in future periods 
there were no comparable transactions in the prior year 
in our communications intelligence segment  revenue increased million  or  primarily due to a million increase in service revenue 
approximately million of the increase is attributable to an increase in our customer install base and the related support revenue generated from this customer install base 
the remaining increase is due primarily to the progress realized during the current year period on certain large projects  some of which commenced in the previous fiscal year  which resulted in an increase in service revenue during the year ended january  compared to the year ended january  product revenue in our communications intelligence segment increased million  or  primarily due to new 
table of contents communications intelligence product offerings 
in our video intelligence segment  revenue increased million  or  primarily due to increased product deliveries to customers compared to the prior year and recognition of revenue associated with the completion of an implementation of a project for a large customer during the year ended january  compared to the prior year  partially offset by a reduction in revenue recognized from prior fiscal years multiple element arrangements 
these arrangements are being recognized ratably over several quarters or years primarily due to the prior business practice of providing implied pcs to video intelligence customers for which vsoe did not exist 
for more details on our revenue by segment  see revenue by operating segment 
revenue in the americas  emea  and apac represented approximately   and of our total revenue  respectively  in the year ended january  compared to approximately   and  respectively  in the year ended january  operating income was million in the year ended january  compared to operating income of million in the year ended january  the increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of million to million  from million  partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of million to million  from million 
the increase in gross profit was primarily due to increases in our enterprise intelligence and communication intelligence segments as a result of increases in our customer install base and the related support revenue generated from this customer base during the year ended january   which carry higher margins than our implementation services 
the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to a million increase in research and development costs  net  due primarily to an increase in employee headcount and the impact of the weakening us dollar against the israeli shekel and the canadian dollar on research and development wages in our israeli and canadian research and development facilities  partially offset by a million decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the million decrease is primarily due a million decrease in professional fees  excluding fees associated with business combinations  following the completion of our restatement of previously filed financial statements and the conclusion of our previous extended filing delay period in june  a million decrease in stock based compensation primarily due to a decrease in the number of outstanding stock based compensation arrangements accounted for as liability awards  and lower average amounts of outstanding restricted stock units compared to the year ended january  these decreases were partially offset by increases of million in employee compensation and related expenses  a million increase in employee travel expenses  both of which were due to an increase in headcount  a million increase in facilities expenses  partially due to business combinations which closed during the year ended january   a million increase in sales and marketing costs  and a million increase in contractor costs primarily due to increased use of contractors resulting from acquisitions  as well as other internal support activities 
in addition  costs associated with business combinations increased by million  primarily due to million of higher legal and other professional fees and million of other acquisition related costs  both resulting principally from business combinations which closed during the year ended january   partially offset by a million net decrease in the change in fair value of contingent consideration arrangements 
further discussion surrounding our business combinations appears in note  business combinations to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 

table of contents net income attributable to verint systems inc common shares was million and diluted net income per common share was in the year ended january  compared to net income attributable to verint systems inc common shares of million and diluted net income per common share of in the year ended january  the increase in net income attributable to verint systems inc common shares and diluted net income per common share in the year ended january  was due to our increased operating income  as described above  partially offset by million of higher other expense  net  which was primarily driven by an million loss on extinguishment of debt recorded in connection with the termination of our prior credit agreement prior credit agreement during the year ended january  and a million increase in interest expense due to a higher interest rate on our borrowings associated with a july amendment to our prior credit agreement as compared to our new credit agreement  which was effective april  offset by a million decrease in other expense  net  due primarily to a million decrease in losses on derivative financial instruments 
also contributing to the increase in net income attributable to verint systems inc common shares is a million decrease in the provision for income taxes 
for additional information on other expenses  net  and the provision for income taxes  see other income expense  net  and provision for income taxes below

table of contents liquidity and capital resources overview our primary source of cash is the collection of proceeds from the sale of products and services to our customers  including cash periodically collected in advance of delivery or performance 
in april  we entered into a new credit agreement and terminated our prior credit agreement 
the new credit agreement includes a term loan facility  with an outstanding balance of million at january   and a million revolving line of credit  which was unused at january  further discussion of our credit agreements appears below  under credit agreements 
our primary recurring use of cash is payment of our operating costs  which consist primarily of employee related expenses  such as compensation and benefits  as well as general operating expenses for marketing  facilities and overhead costs  and capital expenditures 
we also utilize cash for debt service under our credit agreement and periodically for business acquisitions 
cash generated from operations is our primary source of operating liquidity  and we believe that internally generated cash flows are sufficient to support our current business operations  including debt service and capital expenditure requirements 
we have historically expanded our business in part by investing in strategic growth initiatives  including acquisitions of products  technologies  and businesses 
we have used cash as consideration for substantially all of our historical business acquisitions  including million of net cash expended for business acquisitions during the year ended january  to the extent that we continue this strategy  our future cash requirements and liquidity may be impacted 
we may utilize external capital sources  including debt and equity  to supplement our internally generated sources of liquidity as necessary and if available 
we also may consider initiatives to modify the debt and equity components of our current capitalization  as we did during the year ended january  by entering into a new credit agreement and terminating our prior credit agreement 
a considerable portion of our operating income is earned outside the united states 
cash and cash equivalents held by our subsidiaries outside the united states are generally used to fund the subsidiaries operating requirements and to invest in company growth initiatives  including business acquisitions 
other than for potential business acquisition transactions  we currently do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations for the next months and for the foreseeable future 
should other circumstances arise whereby we require more capital in the united states than is generated by our domestic operations  or should we otherwise consider it in our best interests  we could repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions  which could result in higher effective tax rates 
we have not provided for deferred taxes on the excess of the amount for financial reporting over the tax basis of investments in our foreign subsidiaries because we currently plan to indefinitely reinvest such earnings outside the united states 

table of contents in the past  we have periodically reported a working capital deficit current liabilities in excess of current assets  due largely to the impact of changes in our deferred revenue balances 
because deferred revenue is not a cash settled liability  working capital in this case may not be a meaningful indicator of our liquidity 
we believe our liquidity is better measured and assessed by our operating cash flow 
the following table sets forth  for the years ended january  and  cash and cash equivalents  preferred stock and long term debt january  in thousands cash and cash equivalents preferred stock at carrying value long term debt at january   our cash and cash equivalents totaled million  a decrease of million from million at january  we generated million of operating cash flow during the year ended january   which was more than offset by million paid for business acquisitions and million of payments for capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs

during the year ended january   our financing activities used million of net cash  resulting from repayments of borrowings and other financing obligations of million and million of dividends paid to the noncontrolling stockholders of our joint venture 
liquidity and capital resources requirements based on past performance and current expectations  we believe that our cash  cash equivalents  and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated operating costs  required payments of principal and interest  working capital needs  ordinary course capital expenditures  research and development spending  and other commitments for at least the next months 
currently  we have no plans to pay any cash dividends on our preferred or common stock  which are not permitted under our credit agreement 
our liquidity could be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for our products and service and support  including the impact of changes in customer buying behavior due to the economic environment 
if we determine to make acquisitions or otherwise require additional funds  we may need to raise additional capital  which could involve the issuance of equity or debt securities

table of contents contractual obligations at january   our contractual obligations were as follows payments due by period in thousands total year years years years long term debt obligations  including interest operating lease obligations capital lease obligations purchase obligations other long term obligations total contractual obligations the long term debt obligations reflected above include projected interest payments over the term of the debt  assuming an interest rate of  which was the interest rate in effect for our term loan borrowings as of january  the terms of our long term debt obligations are further discussed in note  long term debt to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
operating lease obligations reflected above exclude future sublease income from certain space we have subleased to third parties 
as of january   total expected future sublease income is million and ranges from million to million on an annual basis through february our purchase obligations are associated with agreements for purchases of goods or services generally including agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum  or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transactions 
agreements to purchase goods or services that have cancellation provisions with no penalties are excluded from these purchase obligations 
our consolidated balance sheet at january  includes million of non current tax reserves  net of related benefits including interest and penalties of million  net of federal benefit for uncertain tax positions 
however these amounts are not included in the table above because it is not possible to predict or estimate the timing of payments for these obligations 
we do not expect to make any significant payments for these uncertain tax positions within the next months 
contingent payments associated with business combinations in connection with certain of our business combinations  we have agreed to make contingent cash payments to the former shareholders of the acquired companies based upon achievement of performance targets following the acquisition dates 
during the year ended january   we completed seven business combinations  all of which included contingent cash consideration arrangements 
please refer to note  business combinations to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for information regarding our business combinations 

table of contents as of january   potential future cash payments under contingent consideration arrangements total million  the estimated fair value of which was million  of which million is included within accrued expenses and other current liabilities  and million is included within other liabilities 
the performance periods associated with these potential payments extend through january off balance sheet arrangements we lease certain of our current facilities  furniture  and equipment under non cancelable operating lease agreements 
we are typically required to pay property taxes  insurance  and normal maintenance costs for these facilities 
in the normal course of business  we provide certain customers with financial performance guarantees  which are generally backed by standby letters of credit or surety bonds 
in general  we would only be liable for the amounts of these guarantees in the event that our nonperformance permits termination of the related contract by our customer  which we believe is remote 
at january   we had approximately million of outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds relating primarily to these performance guarantees 
as of january   we believe we were in compliance with our performance obligations under all contracts for which there is a financial performance guarantee  and the ultimate liability  if any  incurred in connection with these guarantees will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
our historical noncompliance with our performance obligations has been insignificant 
in the normal course of business  we provide indemnifications of varying scopes to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products 
historically  costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations 
to the extent permitted under delaware law or other applicable law  we indemnify our directors  officers  employees  and agents against claims they may become subject to by virtue of serving in such capacities for us 
we also have contractual indemnification agreements with our directors  officers  and certain senior executives 
the maximum amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification arrangements and agreements is potentially unlimited  however  we have insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we are not able to estimate the fair value of these indemnification arrangements and agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage  if any 
as of january   we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that we believe have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenue or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements accounting pronouncements implemented in january  the fasb issued amended standards that require additional fair value disclosures 
these disclosure requirements were effective in two phases 
the initial phase  which was effective for us as of february   requires enhanced disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value as well as disclosures about significant transfers 
the second phase  which was effective for us as of february   requires presentation of disaggregated activity within the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level 
the adoption of these standards did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued updated accounting guidance to clarify that pro forma disclosures should be presented as if a business combination occurred at the beginning of the prior annual period for purposes of preparing both the current reporting period and the prior reporting period pro forma financial information 
these disclosures should be accompanied by a narrative description about the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments 
this new accounting guidance is effective for business combinations consummated in periods beginning after december  and should be applied prospectively as of the date of adoption  although early adoption is permitted 
we adopted this new guidance effective february  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued updated accounting guidance related to the calculation of the carrying amount of a reporting unit when performing the first step of a goodwill impairment test 
this update modifies step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
for those reporting units  an entity is required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
in determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  an entity should consider and assess whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that impairment may exist 
for public companies  this new accounting guidance is effective for impairment tests performed during fiscal years and interim periods within those years that began after december  we adopted this new guidance effective february  the adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our november  tests for goodwill impairment  and we do not believe that it will materially impact future tests for goodwill impairment 
in september  the fasb issued amended standards intended to simplify how tests for potential goodwill impairment are performed 
these amended standards permit an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit in which goodwill resides is less than its carrying value 
for reporting units in which this assessment concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value  these amended standards eliminate the requirement to perform further goodwill impairment testing as required under the previous standards 
we adopted these standards on november  and they did not materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
we do not expect these new standards to materially impact our future consolidated financial statements 

table of contents new accounting pronouncements to be implemented in may  the fasb issued updated accounting guidance to amend existing requirements for fair value measurements and disclosures 
the guidance expands the disclosure requirements around fair value measurements categorized in level of the fair value hierarchy and requires disclosure of the level in the fair value hierarchy of items that are not measured at fair value but whose fair value must be disclosed 
it also clarifies and expands upon existing requirements for fair value measurements of financial assets and liabilities as well as instruments classified in stockholders equity 
the guidance is effective for us beginning with our three month period ending april  we are assessing the impact that the application of this guidance may have on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued amended standards regarding the presentation of comprehensive income 
these amendments eliminate the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of stockholders equity and require the presentation of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in december  the fasb updated this guidance to indefinitely defer the requirement to present items that are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income separately with their respective components of net income and other comprehensive income 
this guidance does not change the items that must be reported within other comprehensive income and the criteria for determining when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income 
these amended standards are effective for us beginning with our three month period ending april  and must be applied retrospectively 
other than the change in presentation  these changes will not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial condition due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
to manage the volatility relating to interest rate and foreign currency risks  we periodically enter into derivative instruments including foreign currency forward exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements 
it is our policy to enter into derivative transactions only to the extent considered necessary to meet our risk management objectives 
we use derivative instruments solely to reduce the financial impact of these risks and do not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
interest rate risk on our debt in april  we entered into our new credit agreement and concurrently terminated our prior credit agreement 
the credit agreement provides for million of secured credit facilities  comprised of a million term loan maturing in october and a million revolving credit facility maturing in april  subject to increase up to a maximum 
table of contents increase of million and reduction from time to time according to the terms of the credit agreement 
the majority of the new term loan proceeds were used to repay all million of outstanding term loan borrowings under our prior credit agreement at the closing date of the credit agreement 
loans under the credit agreement bear interest  payable quarterly or  in the case of eurodollar loans with an interest period of three months or shorter  at the end of any interest period  at a per annum rate of  at our election a in the case of eurodollar loans  the adjusted libo rate plus or if our corporate ratings are at least bb and ba or better  
the adjusted libo rate is the greater of i per annum and ii the product of the libo rate and statutory reserves both as defined in the credit agreement  and b in the case of base rate loans  the base rate plus or if our corporate ratings are at least bb and ba or better  
the base rate is the greatest of i the administrative agent s prime rate  ii the federal funds effective rate as defined in the credit agreement plus and iii the adjusted libo rate for a one month interest period plus 
because the interest rates applicable to borrowings under the credit agreement are variable  we are exposed to market risk from changes in the underlying index rates  which affect our cost of borrowing 
the periodic interest rate on our term loan is currently a function of several factors  most importantly the libo rate and the applicable interest rate margin 
however  borrowings are subject to a libo rate floor in the interest rate calculation  which currently reduces the likelihood of increases in the periodic interest rate  because current short term libo rates are well below 
although the periodic interest rate may still fluctuate based upon our corporate ratings  which determine the interest rate margin  changes in short term libo rates will not impact the calculation unless those rates increase above 
based upon our january  borrowings  for each increase in the applicable libo rate above  our annual interest payments would increase by approximately million 
we had utilized a pay fixed receive variable interest rate swap agreement to partially mitigate the variable interest rate risk associated with our prior credit agreement 
we terminated that agreement in july we may consider utilizing interest rate swap agreements  or other agreements intended to mitigate variable interest rate risk  in the future 
interest rate risk on our investments we invest in cash  cash equivalents  and bank time deposits 
interest rate changes could result in an increase or decrease in interest income we generate from these interest bearing assets 
our cash  cash equivalents  and bank time deposits are primarily maintained at high credit quality financial institutions around the world 
we have not invested in marketable debt or equity securities during the three year period ended january   but may do so in the future as permitted under our investment guidelines 

table of contents the primary objective of our investment activities is the preservation of principal while maximizing investment income and minimizing risk 
we have investment guidelines relative to diversification and maturities designed to maintain safety and liquidity 
as of january  and  we had cash and cash equivalents totaling approximately million and million  respectively  consisting of demand deposits and bank time deposits having maturities of three months or less 
at such dates we also held million and million  respectively  of cash equivalents which were restricted and were not available for general operating use 
these balances primarily represent short term deposits to secure bank guarantees in connection with sales contracts 
the amounts of these deposits can vary depending upon the terms of the underlying contracts 
to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio  we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming  during the year ended january   average short term interest rates increase or decrease by basis points relative to average rates realized during the year ended january  such a change would cause our projected interest income from cash  cash equivalents  and bank time deposits to increase or decrease by approximately million  assuming a similar level of investments in the year ended january  as in the year ended january  due to the short term nature of our cash and cash equivalents and time deposits  the carrying values approximate market values and are not generally subject to price risk due to fluctuations in interest rates 
see note  investments to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for more information regarding our short term investments 
foreign currency exchange risk the functional currency for most of our foreign subsidiaries is the respective local currency  of which the notable exceptions are our subsidiaries in israel and canada  whose functional currencies are the us dollar 
we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we convert the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars for consolidated reporting purposes 
if there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates  the conversion of the foreign subsidiaries financial statements into us dollars results in a gain or loss which is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss within stockholders equity deficit 
our international operations subject us to risks associated with currency fluctuations 
while most of our revenue and expenses are denominated in us dollars  we do have a significant portion of our operating expenses  primarily labor expenses  that is denominated in the local currencies where our foreign operations are located  primarily israel  the united kingdom  germany  and canada 
we also generate some of our revenue in foreign currencies  mainly the british pound sterling and euro 
as a result  our consolidated us dollar operating results are subject to the potentially adverse impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar and the other currencies in which we transact 

table of contents in addition  we have certain assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the respective entity s functional currency 
changes in the functional currency value of these assets and liabilities create fluctuations that result in gains or losses 
we recorded million and million of net foreign currency gains for the years ended january  and  respectively  and million of net foreign currency losses for the year ended january  from time to time  we enter into foreign currency forward contracts in an effort to reduce the volatility of cash flows primarily related to forecasted payroll and payroll related expenses denominated in israeli shekels and canadian dollars 
these contracts are generally limited to durations of approximately months or less 
our owned joint venture in singapore enters into foreign currency forward contracts in an effort to reduce the volatility of cash flows primarily related to forecasted us dollar payments to its suppliers 
these contracts are generally limited to durations of approximately months or less 
we have also periodically entered into foreign currency forward contracts to manage exposures resulting from forecasted customer collections denominated in currencies other than the respective entity s functional currency 
we have not entered into any foreign currency forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
during the years ended january   and  we realized net losses of million  million and million  respectively  on settlements of foreign currency forward contracts not designated as hedges 
we had million of net unrealized gains on outstanding foreign currency forward contracts as of january   with notional amounts totaling million 
we had million of net unrealized losses on outstanding foreign currency forward contracts as of january   with notional amounts totaling million 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of january  this sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the us dollar  and assuming no changes in interest rates 
a increase in the value of the us dollar would lead to a decrease in the fair value of our hedging instruments by million 
conversely  a decrease in the value of the us dollar would result in an increase in the fair value of these financial instruments by million 
the counterparties to these foreign currency forward contracts are multinational commercial banks 
while we believe the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not material  the disruption in the global financial markets in recent years has impacted some of the financial institutions with which we do business 
a sustained decline in the financial stability of financial institutions as a result of the disruption in the financial markets could affect our ability to secure creditworthy counterparties for our foreign currency hedging programs
