item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a describes the matters that we consider to be important to understanding the results of our operations for each of the three years in the period ended december   and our capital resources and liquidity as of december  our discussion begins with our assessment of the condition of the north american trailer industry along with a summary of the actions we have taken to strengthen the company 
we then analyze the results of our operations for the last three years  including the trends in the overall business and our operating segments  followed by a discussion of our cash flows and liquidity  capital markets events and transactions  our credit facility and contractual commitments 
we also provide a review of the critical accounting judgments and estimates that we have made that we believe are most important to an understanding of our md a and our consolidated financial statements 
these are the critical accounting policies that affect the recognition and measurement of our transactions and the balances in our consolidated financial statements 
we conclude our md a with information on recent accounting pronouncements that we adopted during the year  if any  as well as those not yet adopted that may have an impact on our financial accounting practices 
we have three reportable operating segments commercial trailer products  diversified products and retail 
the commercial trailer products segment produces trailers that are sold to customers who purchase trailers directly or through independent dealers and to the retail segment 
the diversified products segment focuses on our commitment to expand our customer base  diversify our product offerings and revenues and extend our market leadership by leveraging our proprietary duraplate panel technology  drawing on our core manufacturing expertise and making available products that are complementary to the truck trailers and transportation equipment we offer 
the retail segment includes the sale of new and used trailers  as well as the sale of aftermarket parts and service through our retail branch network 
executive summary while we experienced historically low demand for trailers during the years ending december  and as the trailer industry dropped to levels not seen in over years  the period was still a significant improvement from the previous year period and reflected the beginning of a recovery within the trailer industry 
the demand environment for the trailer industry has continued to strengthen throughout  as evidenced by the increase in our new trailer shipments and an improved backlog of million 
according to most recent act estimates  total new trailer shipments in were approximately  trailers  representing an increase of as compared to the prior year shipments and the first year since that the total trailer demand exceeded replacement demand levels of approximately  trailers 
these positive trends  coupled with our continued diversification initiatives  yielded significant improvement to both revenue and gross profit as compared to the previous years 
gross profit levels showed improvement in due primarily to increases in new trailer volumes and continued growth of our non trailer product revenues  which generally provide higher margins as compared to the previous year 
as the outlook within the trailer industry continued to show signs of significant positive momentum  in june we entered into a new credit agreement with wells fargo capital finance  llc  as well as certain other lender participants  which  as subsequently amended  increased our borrowing capacity from million to million  subject to a borrowing base  extended the maturity by five years to june and reduced our borrowing costs relative to the previous facility 
this new facility also provides us the option to increase the total borrowing capacity to million  subject to certain conditions 
as a result of our new credit agreement  a continued improvement in the trailer market and the various cash management actions implemented during the most recent economic downturn  we were able to make significant improvements to our liquidity position  defined as cash on hand and available borrowing capacity 
as of december   our liquidity position totaled million  an increase of approximately million  or  from the previous year 
the outlook for the overall trailer market for supports an environment of continued increased demand when compared to in fact  most recent estimates from industry forecasters  act and ftr associates ftr  indicate demand levels to be in excess of  trailers through and levels above  through furthermore  both act and ftr are currently estimating levels to be approximately  and  trailers  respectively  reflecting an approximate increase of as compared to this continued strong 
table of contents demand environment reinforces our belief that the recovery of the industry is under way  and we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the expected improvement in overall demand while also achieving improvements to our pricing of trailers to support further investment in these products 
while was a price competitive environment for the trailer industry  we have begun to see some improvement in pricing power as trailer order demand and confidence levels have increased throughout the past couple years 
we are also not relying solely on volume recovery within the trailer industry to improve operations and enhance profitability 
through our diversified products operating segment  we remain committed to enhancing our business model through organic growth  expanding our customer base  diversifying our product offerings and revenues and extending our market leadership by leveraging our proprietary duraplate panel technology  drawing on our core manufacturing expertise and making available products that are complementary to the truck trailers and transportation related equipment we offer 
through this operating segment  we can offer a wide array of products and customer specific solutions that we believe provide a good foundation for achieving these goals 
continuing to identify the appropriate opportunities to leverage our proprietary technology and core manufacturing expertise into new applications and end markets enables us to deliver greater value to our customers and shareholders 
operating performance we measure our operating performance in four key areas safety environmental  quality  productivity and continuous improvement 
our objective of being better today than yesterday and better tomorrow than we are today is simple  straightforward and easily understood by all our associates 
safety environmental 
we continually focus on reducing the severity and frequency of workplace injuries in order to minimize our workers compensation costs and to create a safe environment for all associates 
in addition  we maintain iso registration of our environmental management system at our lafayette operations 
we believe that our improved environmental  health and safety management translates into higher labor productivity and lower costs as a result of less time away from work and improved system management 
quality 
we monitor product quality on a continual basis through a number of means for both internal and external performance as follows internal performance 
our primary internal quality measurement is process yield 
process yield is a performance metric that measures the impact of all aspects of the business on our ability to ship trailers at the end of the production process 
as with previous years  the expectations of the highest quality product continue to increase while maintaining process yield performance and reducing rework 
external performance 
we actively measure and track our warranty claims and costs 
early life cycle warranty claims are trended for performance monitoring and have shown a steady improvement from an average of approximately claims per trailers in to claims per trailers in this information is utilized  along with other data  to drive continuous improvement initiatives relative to product quality and reliability 
productivity 
we measure productivity on many fronts 
some key indicators include production line cycle time speed  man hours per trailer and inventory levels 
improvements over the last several years in these areas have translated into significant improvements in our ability to better manage inventory flow and control costs 
during the past couple of years  we focused on productivity enhancements within manufacturing assembly and sub assembly areas through developing the capability for mixed model production 
we also established a central warehousing and distribution center to improve material flow  inventory levels and inventory accuracy within our supply chain 
the successful implementation of these productivity enhancements supported our ability to effectively manage the increases in trailer volumes realized in and anticipated in the future as compared to the previous year 
cost reduction 
we believe continuous improvement is a fundamental component of our operational excellence focus 
in  we trained and deployed several team focused groups through the successful integration of a wabash integrated network win program which empowered the manufacturing workforce to improve their departments through continuous improvement activities in many areas throughout our company 
our continued focus on the win program in has allowed us to improve all 
table of contents areas of manufacturing  including safety  quality  inventory management  maintenance and cost reduction 
utilizing these systems has enabled us to realize total cost per unit reductions by increased capacity utilization of all facilities while maintaining a lower level of fixed overhead 
in addition  in we were able to successfully complete the consolidation of our platform manufacturing facilities into one location which has enabled us to significantly lower our overall manufacturing cost per unit 
industry trends truck transportation in the us  according to the ata  was estimated to be a billion industry in ata estimates that approximately of all freight tonnage is carried by trucks at some point during its shipment 
trailer demand is a direct function of the amount of freight to be transported 
to monitor the state of the industry  we evaluate a number of indicators related to trailer manufacturing and the transportation industry 
recent trends we have observed include the following transportation trailer cycle 
transportation in the us  including trucking  is a cyclical industry that has experienced three cycles over the last years 
the most recently completed cycle began in early when industry shipments totaled approximately  reached a peak in with shipments of approximately  and reached the bottom in with shipments of approximately  trailers 
in each of these three us economic downturns  the decline in freight tonnage preceded the general economic decline by approximately two and one half years and its recovery has generally preceded that of the economy as a whole 
the trailer industry generally follows the transportation industry cycles 
after three consecutive years with total trailer output well below replacement demand levels of approximately  trailers  was a year of significant improvement in which the total trailer market increased from the previous year to approximately  as we enter the early stages of an economic recovery  act is estimating demand within the trailer industry to increase in and to approximately  and  trailers  respectively  with forecasted demand to remain above  trailers through furthermore  the increase in demand for trailers in and is being driven by improvements within the dry van segment  our largest product line 
act is forecasting the total dry van market to grow from approximately  trailers in to approximately  and  trailers in and  respectively  representing year over year increases of and  respectively 
our view is generally consistent with that of act 
age of trailer fleets 
the average age of fleets has continued to increase over the past several years as fleets deferred on their capital investments during the most recent industry downturn 
according to act  the average age of dry and refrigerated vans in remained at historical highs that were reached in of approximately years and years  respectively  as compared to years and years  respectively  in the increase in age of trailers suggests an increase in replacement demand over the next several years 
new trailer orders 
according to act  total orders in were approximately  trailers  a increase from approximately  trailers ordered in  driven by the dry van segment  the largest within the trailer industry  increasing year over year by approximately 
transportation regulations and legislation 
there are several different topics within both federal and state government regulations and legislation that are expected to have an impact on trailer demand  including the federal motor carrier safety administration the fmcsa is currently looking at ways to improve the overall truck safety standards  particularly by implementing comprehensive safety analysis csa 
csa is considered a comprehensive driver and fleet rating system that will measure both the freight carriers and its drivers on several safety related criteria  including driver safety  equipment maintenance and overall condition of trailers 
this system is expected to drive increased awareness and action by carriers since enforcement actions were targeted and implemented beginning in june csa is generally believed to have contributed to the tightening of the supply of drivers and capacity in as carriers took measures to improve their rating 
the fmcsa issued a final rule in december on its revised proposal for rule changes in regard to truck driver hours of service rules 
the new proposed rule changes include reductions in total driver 
table of contents hours from hours per week to hours and retains the per day limit of hours 
the rule  which is scheduled to go into effect in july  also requires alterations to the required rest period that drivers must follow 
though this proposal has been met with strong opposition  particularly by the ata  current estimates indicate these actions could lead to productivity losses of approximately 
we believe this ruling will increase the general need for equipment and increases the potential that a carrier s drop and hook activities will increase and  therefore  requiring a higher ratio of trailer to trucks across the industry 
the fmcsa also issued in january a proposed rule change requiring the installation and use of electronic on board recorders for over the road trucks and buses which would be used to monitor and enforce the driver hour of service rules 
the proposed rule was rejected by the us circuit court of appeals in september and the fmcsa is working on a revised rule to meet the june deadline 
the tax relief act of extended bonus depreciation provisions for and more specifically  corporations can expense and of certain capital investments made during and  respectively 
this extension will be an incentive for many fleets to increase or accelerate their purchase decisions to maximize the tax benefits available 
the california air resource board carb regulations mandate that refrigeration units older than years may no longer operate in california 
as refrigeration units become obsolete  capacity in the refrigerated segment will tighten and the increase in demand for new refrigerated trailers is likely 
carb regulations also mandate fuel efficiency improvements on all fleets operating in california for which our duraplate aeroskirt provides a durable  aerodynamic side panel solution yielding the improved fuel efficiencies required by these regulations 
other developments 
other developments and potential impacts on the industry include miniaturization of electronic products resulting in increased density of loads could further decrease demand for dry van trailers 
packaging optimization of bulk goods and the efficiency of the packaging around goods may contribute to further decreases in demand for dry van trailers 
trucking company profitability  which can be influenced by factors such as fuel prices  freight tonnage volumes  and government regulations  is highly correlated with the overall economy of the us carrier profitability significantly impacts demand for  and the financial ability to purchase  new trailers 
although truck driver shortages have not been a significant problem in the past year  constraints are expected to exacerbate as freight demand increases 
as a result  trucking companies are under increased pressure to look for alternative ways to move freight  leading to more intermodal freight movement 
we believe that railroads are at or near capacity  which will limit their ability to respond to freight demand pressures 
therefore  we expect that the majority of freight will continue to be moved by truck and  according to ata  overall truck activity as a percentage of the total freight industry is expected to increase throughout the next decade

outlook the demand environment for trailers has continued to improve throughout  as evidenced by the increase in our new trailer shipments and a strong backlog as well as trailer industry forecasts for the upcoming years 
we expect continued improvements in the overall trailer market as well as a continued strong order environment in recent estimates from industry forecasters  act and ftr  indicate shipment levels to be in excess of  trailers in and increasing to more than  trailers in specifically  act is currently estimating levels to be approximately  trailers  or an increase of as compared to  while ftr anticipates new trailer demand to be approximately  new trailers  or an increase of  for as compared to for  act estimates that total trailer industry shipments will continue to grow by an additional to a total of approximately  trailers  while ftr anticipates only a slight decrease from but continues to forecast a strong demand environment with volumes reaching approximately  total trailers 
while there are downside concerns relating to issues with the global economy  unemployment  and housing and construction related markets in the us  taking into consideration these industry forecasts  discussions with both our customers and suppliers as well as the need to renew an excessively aged trailer fleet  management expects demand for new trailers to continue to remain strong as we move into we believe we are well positioned for long term growth in the industry because our core customers are among the dominant participants in the trucking industry  our duraplate trailers continue to have increased market acceptance  our focus is on developing solutions that reduce our customers trailer maintenance and operating costs  and continued expansion of our presence through our company owned branch locations and independent dealer network 
our expectations for industry volumes are generally in line with those of act and ftr 
the challenges we face as we proceed into will primarily relate to the pricing of new trailers and rising raw material commodity and component costs 
these costs remain volatile as overall demand will drive an increase in prices as the economy continues to improve 
as has been our policy  we will endeavor to pass along raw material and component price increases to our customers 
our standard sales terms and conditions allow for price adjustments associated with raw material increases  however  in some cases  we have provided fixed price trailer contracts to key customers for periods of up to months 
in addition  we have recently separated the cost of tires from all new orders to allow for the pass through of price increases as they occur 
we have a focus on continuing to develop innovative new products that both add value to our customers operations and allow us to continue to differentiate our products from the competition 
based on industry forecasts  conversations with our customers regarding their current requirements and our existing backlog of orders  we estimate that for the full year total new trailers sold will be between  and  an increase from of approximately to 
furthermore  while demand for our non trailer products is dependent on the development of new products  customer acceptance of our product solutions and general expansion of our customer base and distribution channels  we anticipate the growth rate of these products to be in excess of 
as a result of increased pricing as the demand environment for trailers continues to strengthen  improved productivity as our workforce stablizes  and continued expansion of the business through our diversified products initiatives  we expect to deliver improved profitability in

significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  evaluation of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time we were making the estimate or changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could have selected would have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations

balance sheet caption critical estimate item nature of estimates required assumptions approaches used key factors other accrued liabilities and other non current liabilities warranty estimating warranty requires us to forecast the resolution of existing claims and expected future claims on products sold 
we base our estimate on historical trends of trailers sold and payment amounts  combined with our current understanding of the status of existing claims  recall campaigns and discussions with our customers 
failure rates and estimated repair costs accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts requires us to estimate the financial capability of customers to pay for products 
we base our estimates on historical experience  the time an account is outstanding  customer s financial condition and information from credit rating services 
customer financial condition inventories lower of cost or market write downs we evaluate future demand for products  market conditions and incentive programs 
estimates are based on recent sales data  historical experience  external market analysis and third party appraisal services 
market conditions product type property  plant and equipment  intangible assets  and other assets impairment of long lived assets we are required periodically to review the recoverability of certain of our assets based on projections of anticipated future cash flows  including future profitability assessments of various product lines 
we estimate cash flows using internal budgets based on recent sales data  and independent trailer production volume estimates 
future production estimates deferred income taxes recoverability of deferred tax assets in particular  net operating loss carry forwards we are required to estimate whether recoverability of our deferred tax assets is more likely than not based on forecasts of taxable earnings 
we use historical operating results for the past years and projected future operating results  based upon our business plans  including a review of the eligible carry forward period  tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations 
historical operating results variances in future projected profitability  including by taxing entity tax law changes additional paid in capital stock based compensation we are required to estimate the fair value of all stock awards we grant 
we use a binomial valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock awards 
we feel the binomial model provides the most accurate estimate of fair value 
risk free interest rate historical volatility dividend yield expected term in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not as critical as those discussed above 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 
the determination of the fair market value of new and used trailers is subject to variation  particularly in times of rapidly changing market conditions 
a change in the valuation of our new and used inventories at december   would be approximately million 
other inflation we have historically been able to offset the impact of rising costs through productivity improvements as well as selective price increases 
as a result  inflation has not had  and is not expected to have  a significant impact on our business 

table of contents new accounting pronouncements during  there were no new accounting pronouncements that had or are expected to have a material impact to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to the risks inherent in our operations  we have exposure to financial and market risk resulting from volatility in commodity prices and interest rates 
the following discussion provides additional detail regarding our exposure to these risks 
a 
commodity price risks we are exposed to fluctuation in commodity prices through the purchase of raw materials that are processed from commodities such as aluminum  steel  wood and polyethylene 
given the historical volatility of certain commodity prices  this exposure can significantly impact product costs 
historically  we have managed aluminum price changes by entering into fixed price contracts with our suppliers 
as of december   we had million in raw material purchase commitments through december for materials that will be used in the production process 
we typically do not set prices for our products more than days in advance of our commodity purchases and can  subject to competitive market conditions  take into account the cost of the commodity in setting our prices for each order 
to the extent that we are unable to offset the increased commodity costs in our product prices  our results would be materially and adversely affected 
b 
interest rates as of december   we had million of floating rate debt outstanding under our revolving facility 
a hypothetical basis point change in the floating interest rate from the current level would result in a corresponding million change in interest expense over a one year period 
this sensitivity analysis does not account for the change in the competitive environment indirectly related to the change in interest rates and the potential managerial action taken in response to these changes
