item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and consolidated results of operations  in this form k 
we continue to focus on enhancing stockholder value by implementing our operating and cash utilization strategies 
we have developed and implemented incentive programs that help focus our entire company on realizing key performance metrics  including increasing free cash flow  achieving targeted earnings  and maintaining and improving returns on invested capital 
our operating and cash utilization strategies are described further below 

table of contents operating strategy we seek to leverage existing assets and revenue growth to increase operating margins and enhance stockholder value 
our operating strategy for accomplishing these goals includes the following using the extensive industry knowledge and experience of our executive management team  using a decentralized management structure in overseeing day to day operations  using our strong  integrated operating platform  and implementing major initiatives aimed at improving the quality of our service and our operating margins 
experienced executive management team we believe we have one of the most experienced executive management teams in the solid waste industry

rissman joined allied as vice president and deputy general counsel in july and continued in the same positions at republic following the allied acquisition in december prior to joining allied  mr 
rissman was a partner at mayer brown llp  in chicago  where he worked from until coming to allied in our regional senior vice presidents have an average of years of experience in the industry 

table of contents decentralized management structure we rely on a decentralized management structure to minimize administrative overhead costs and to more efficiently manage our day to day operations 
our local management has extensive industry experience in growing  operating and managing solid waste companies and has substantial experience in their local geographic markets 
this allows us to quickly respond to and meet our customers needs and stay in touch with local businesses and municipalities 
each regional management team includes a senior vice president  vice president controller  vice president of human resources  vice president of sales  vice president of operations support  director of safety  director of engineering and environmental management  and director of market planning and development 
we believe that our strong regional management teams allow us to more effectively and efficiently drive our initiatives and help ensure consistency throughout the organization 
our regional management teams and area presidents have extensive authority  responsibility and autonomy for operations within their respective geographic markets 
compensation for area management teams is primarily based on improving operating income  free cash flow and return on invested capital generated in each manager s geographic area of responsibility 
in addition  through long term incentive programs  including stock options  we believe we have achieved one of the lowest turnover levels in the industry for our local management teams 
as a result of retaining experienced managers with extensive knowledge of and involvement in their local communities  we are proactive in anticipating customers needs and adjusting to changes in our markets 
we also seek to implement the best practices of our various regions  areas and divisions throughout our operations to continue improving operating margins 
strong  integrated operating platform we believe we have created a company with a strong  national operating platform 
we seek to achieve a high rate of internalization by controlling waste streams from the point of collection through diversion to our materials recovery facilities for processing or disposal 
our fully integrated markets generally have a lower cost of operations and more favorable cash flows than our non integrated markets 
through acquisitions  landfill operating agreements and other market development activities  we create market specific  integrated operations typically consisting of one or more collection operations  transfer stations and landfills 
we consider acquiring companies that own or operate landfills with significant permitted disposal capacity and appropriate levels of waste volumes 
we also seek to acquire solid waste collection operations in markets in which we own or operate landfills 
in addition  we generate internal growth in our disposal operations by developing new landfills and expanding our existing landfills from time to time in markets in which we have significant collection operations or in markets that we determine lack sufficient disposal capacity 
during the years ended december   and  approximately  and  respectively  of the total waste volume that we collected was disposed at landfill sites that we own or operate internalization 
in a number of our larger markets  we and our competitors are required to take waste to government controlled disposal facilities flow control 
this provides us with an opportunity to effectively compete in these markets without investing in landfill capacity 
our priorities and major initiatives to generate cash value our priorities are designed to deliver total waste stream solutions  including recycling  to our customers while creating sustainable economic value for our stockholders 
we believe focusing on the following priorities and major initiatives will improve profitability and generate value for our stockholders safety 
safety remains our highest priority for all of our employees and the communities we serve 
our long standing commitment to safety is unwavering 
we will continue to improve our driver safety training program and reward our people for operating in a safe and conscientious manner in all our lines of business 
people 
we work to create and maintain an environment that attracts  develops and retains people who assure our success with customers  differentiate us from our competitors and allow us to be an employer of choice for top talent 

table of contents durability 
we believe our decentralized management structure provides us with a competitive advantage by allowing us to quickly respond to and meet customer s needs and to stay in touch with local businesses and municipalities 
however  functions such as fleet maintenance and customer service are areas where we believe we can continue to build durable  consistent processes across all operating divisions 
through standardization of core functions  we believe we can minimize variability in our maintenance facilities  resulting in a safer fleet of vehicles with lower operating costs and increased efficiency 
by converting certain of our residential routes to automated single driver side load service  we believe we can more efficiently service our customers  improve safety  increase productivity and reduce labor costs 
through  we converted approximately of our residential routes 
approximately of our vehicle purchases during were vehicles fueled by natural gas 
we expect that using natural gas will reduce our overall fleet operating costs 
customer experience 
we strive to provide the highest level of customer service 
our policy is to periodically visit each commercial account to ensure customer service and satisfaction 
in addition to visiting existing customers  a salesperson develops a base of prospective customers within each market 
we also have municipal marketing representatives who are responsible for working with each municipality or community to which we provide residential service to ensure customer satisfaction 
additionally  the municipal representatives organize and drive the effort to obtain new or renew municipal contracts in their service areas 
we will continue to invest in our vehicles  other equipment  landfills  recycling and other facilities to ensure the highest level of service to our customers and the communities we serve 
in addition  we continue to focus on innovative waste disposal processes and programs to help our customers achieve their goals related to sustainability and environmentally sound waste practices 
we will continue to exceed our customers expectations through consistently delivering high quality service and an expanded use of technology to make it easier to do business with us 
our technology eventually will allow more customers to access information and perform functions like changing service requests and making payments over the internet that were previously done with the assistance of a customer service representative 
by increasing the ease of use and functionality of our web based market presence  we believe we will enhance customer satisfaction and retention while we lower our costs 
targeted profitable growth 
our growth strategy focuses on increasing revenue  gaining market share and enhancing stockholder value through internal growth in price and volume as well as through development activities  acquisitions and improving our operating margins 
the key components of our growth strategy are price growth 
we seek to secure price increases necessary to offset increased costs  to improve our operating margins and to obtain adequate returns on our substantial investments in vehicles  other equipment  landfills  and other facilities 
volume growth 
growth through increases in our customer base and services provided is the most capital efficient means for us to grow our business 
we seek to obtain long term contracts for collecting solid waste with exclusive franchise agreements with municipalities as well as commercial and industrial contracts 
by obtaining such long term agreements  we have the opportunity to grow our contracted revenue base at the same rate as the underlying population growth in these markets 
in addition  we believe that by securing a base of long term recurring revenue  we are better able to protect our market position from competition and our business may be less susceptible to downturns in economic conditions 
we work to increase volumes while ensuring that prices charged for such services provide an appropriate return on our capital investment 
sales and marketing activities 
we manage our sales and marketing activities to enable us to capitalize on our leading position in many of the markets in which we operate 
we provide a national 
table of contents accounts program in response to the needs of our national and regional clients  centralizing services to effectively manage their needs  such as minimizing their costs and contributing to their sustainability efforts 
our sales and marketing employees in the field are compensated using a commission structure that is focused on generating high levels of quality revenue 
these employees directly solicit business from existing and new commercial  industrial  municipal and residential customers 
when training sales personnel  we emphasize increased price structures as well as the use of a customer relationship management system that assists in tracking sales opportunities 
it also tracks renewal periods for potential commercial  industrial and franchise contracts 
we believe our national accounts program offers an opportunity for sales growth over the next several years 
development activities 
we seek to identify opportunities to further our position as an integrated service provider in markets where we are not fully integrated 
where appropriate  we seek to obtain permits to build transfer stations  materials recovery facilities  and landfills that would provide vertically integrated waste services or expand the service areas for our existing disposal sites 
development projects  while generally less capital intensive than acquisitions  typically require extensive permitting efforts that can take years to complete with no assurance of success 
we undertake development projects when we believe there is a reasonable probability of success and where reasonably priced acquisition opportunities are not available 
acquisitions 
our acquisition growth strategy focuses primarily on acquiring privately held solid waste and recycling companies and the waste and recycling operations and facilities of municipal and other local governmental authorities that complement our existing business platform 
we believe our ability to acquire privately held companies is enhanced by increasing competition in the solid waste industry  increasing capital requirements due to changes in solid waste regulatory requirements  and the limited number of exit strategies for privately held companies 
we believe our ability to acquire operations and facilities from municipalities that are privatizing is enhanced  as they increasingly seek to raise capital and reduce risk 
in addition  we will continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire operations and facilities that are being divested by other publicly owned waste companies 
the consolidation of acquired businesses into existing operations reduces costs by decreasing capital and expenses used for truck routing  personnel  equipment and vehicle maintenance  inventories and back office administration 
generally  we consolidate our acquired administrative centers to reduce our general and administrative costs 
for certain risks related to our operating strategy  see item a  risk factors  in this form k 
cash utilization strategy key components of our cash utilization strategy include generating and growing free cash flow and sustaining or improving our return on invested capital 
our definition of free cash flow  which is not a measure determined in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles us gaap  is cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment  plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
we believe that free cash flow is a driver of stockholder value and provides useful information regarding the recurring cash provided by our operations 
free cash flow also demonstrates our ability to execute our cash utilization strategy  which includes internal growth and acquisitions  share repurchases  dividends  and a strong capital structure 

table of contents we manage our free cash flow by ensuring that capital expenditures and operating asset levels are appropriate in light of our existing business and growth opportunities and by closely managing our working capital  which consists primarily of accounts receivable and accounts payable 
internal growth and acquisitions within our markets  our goal is to deliver sustainable  long term profitable growth while efficiently operating our assets to generate acceptable rates of return 
we allocate capital to businesses  markets and development projects both to support growth and to achieve acceptable rates of return 
we develop previously non permitted materials recovery facilities  transfer stations and landfills 
we also expand our existing materials recovery facilities  transfer stations and landfills  when possible 
we supplement this organic growth with acquisitions of operating assets  such as landfills  transfer stations  materials recovery facilities and tuck in acquisitions of collection and disposal operations in existing markets 
we continuously evaluate our existing operating assets and their deployment within each market to determine if we have optimized our position and to ensure appropriate investment of capital 
where operations are not generating acceptable returns  we examine opportunities to achieve greater efficiencies and returns through integrating additional assets 
if such enhancements are not possible  we may ultimately decide to divest the existing assets and reallocate resources to other markets 
share repurchases in august  our board of directors approved a share repurchase program pursuant to which we may repurchase up to million of our outstanding shares of common stock through december  this authorization is in addition to the million repurchase program authorized in november from november to december   we used million under these programs to repurchase million shares at a weighted average cost per share of 
we expect to use the remaining funds  totaling million  to repurchase our outstanding shares of common stock throughout and dividends in july  our board of directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend of per share 
our quarterly dividend has increased from time to time thereafter  the latest increase occurring in the third quarter of to per share  representing a compound annual growth rate of approximately 
we expect to continue paying quarterly cash dividends and may consider additional dividend increases if we believe they will enhance stockholder value 
strong capital structure debt 
following our december  allied acquisition  we initiated a debt reduction program that  to date  has resulted in a net reduction in borrowings of billion funded by cash flow from operations and proceeds from disposition of assets 
we also refinanced billion in senior notes and million in tax exempt financings  which reduced the average coupon rate on our senior notes and tax exempt financings  on a weighted average basis  by more than basis points while extending our debt maturities and giving greater stability to our capital structure 
we anticipate taking further advantage of capital market opportunities to mitigate our financial risk by issuing new debt and using the proceeds to repay existing debt 
early extinguishment of debt will result in a charge in the period in which the debt is repaid 
credit ratings 
we believe that a key component of our financial strategy includes maintaining investment grade ratings on our senior debt  which was rated bbb by standard poor s  bbb by fitch and baa by moody s as of december  such ratings have allowed us  and should continue to allow us  to readily access capital markets at competitive rates 
our cash utilization strategy will continue to focus on maintaining our investment grade credit ratings 
for certain risks related to our cash utilization strategy  see item a  risk factors  in this form k 

table of contents operations our operations primarily consist of providing collection  transfer station and disposal of non hazardous solid waste and the recovery and recycling of certain materials 
collection services 
we provide solid waste collection services to commercial  industrial  municipal and residential customers through collection operations 
in  of our revenue was derived from collection services 
within the collection line of business  of our revenue is from services provided to municipal and residential customers  is from services provided to commercial customers  and is from services provided to industrial and other customers 
our residential collection operations involve the curbside collection of refuse from small containers into collection vehicles for transport to transfer stations or directly to landfills 
we typically perform residential solid waste collection services under contracts with municipalities  which we generally secure by competitive bid and which give us exclusive rights to service all or a portion of the homes in the respective municipalities 
these contracts or franchises usually range in duration from one to five years  although some of our exclusive franchises are for significantly longer periods 
we also perform residential solid waste collection services on a subscription basis  in which individual households contract directly with us 
the fees received for subscription residential collection are based primarily on market factors  frequency and type of service  the distance to the disposal facility and the cost of disposal 
in general  subscription residential collection fees are paid quarterly in advance by the residential customers receiving the service 
in our commercial and industrial collection operations  we supply our customers with waste containers of varying sizes 
we also rent compactors to large waste generators 
we typically perform commercial collection services under one to three year service agreements  and we determine fees by considerations such as market factors  collection frequency  type of equipment furnished  the type and volume or weight of the waste collected  transportation costs  the distance and cost of disposal 
we also provide waste collection services to industrial and construction facilities on a contractual basis with terms ranging from a single pickup to one year or longer 
our construction services are provided to the commercial construction and home building sectors 
we collect the containers or compacted waste and transport the waste to either a landfill or a transfer station for disposal 
transfer services 
we own or operate transfer stations  and in transfer services accounted for of our revenue 
revenue at transfer stations is primarily generated by charging tipping or disposal fee 
our collection operations deposit waste at these transfer stations  as do other private and municipal haulers  for compaction and transfer to disposal sites or materials recovery facilities 
essentially  transfer stations provide collection operations with a cost effective means to consolidate waste and reduce transportation costs while providing our landfill sites with an additional gate to extend the geographic reach of a particular landfill site with the goal of increased internalization 
disposal services 
we own or operate active landfills 
we charge tipping fees to third parties  and in disposal services accounted for of our revenue 
we had approximately  permitted acres and total available permitted and probable expansion disposal capacity of approximately billion in place cubic yards 
the in place capacity of our landfills is subject to change based on engineering factors  requirements of regulatory authorities  our ability to continue to operate our landfills in compliance with applicable regulations  and our ability to successfully renew operating permits and obtain expansion permits at our sites 
some of our landfills accept non hazardous special waste  including utility ash  asbestos and contaminated soils 
most of our active landfill sites have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond the currently permitted acreage 
we monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes and prices  market needs  
table of contents remaining capacity and the likelihood of obtaining an expansion 
to satisfy future disposal demand  we are currently seeking to expand permitted capacity at certain of our landfills 
however  we cannot assure you that all proposed or future expansions will be permitted as designed 
we also have responsibility for closed landfills  for which we have associated closure and post closure obligations 
recycling services 
we own or operate materials recovery facilities and other recycling operations 
these facilities generate revenue through the collection  processing  and sale of old corrugated cardboard occ  old newspaper onp  aluminum  glass and other materials 
most of these recyclable materials are internally collected by our residential and industrial collection operations 
changing market demand for recyclable materials causes volatility in commodity prices 
at current volumes and mix of materials  we believe a ten dollar per ton change in the price of recyclable materials will change annual revenue and operating income by approximately million and million  respectively  on an annual basis 
in certain instances we issue recycling rebates to municipalities or large industrial customers  which can be based on the price we receive upon the final sale of recyclable materials  a fixed contractual rate or other measures 
we also receive rebates when we dispose of recyclable materials at third party facilities 
other services 
other revenue consists primarily of national accounts revenue generated from nationwide contracts in markets outside our operating areas  where the associated waste handling services are subcontracted to local operators 
consequently  substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs  which are recorded in cost of operations 
sales and marketing we seek to provide quality services that will enable us to maintain high levels of customer satisfaction 
our business is derived from a broad customer base  which we believe will enable us to experience stable growth 
we focus our marketing efforts on continuing and expanding our business with existing customers  as well as attracting new customers 
our sales and marketing strategy provides high quality  comprehensive solid waste collection  recycling  transfer and disposal services to our customers at competitive prices 
we target customers of all sizes  from small quantity generators to large fortune companies and municipalities 
while most of our marketing activity is local in nature  we also provide a national accounts program in response to the needs of national and regional customers 
this national accounts program is designed to provide the best total solution to our customers evolving waste management needs in an environmentally responsible manner 
we partner with national clients to reach their sustainability goals  optimize waste streams  balance equipment and service intervals  and provide customized reporting 
the national accounts program centralizes services to effectively manage customer needs  while helping minimize costs 
with our extended geographic reach  this program effectively serves our customers nationwide 
as industry leaders  our mission is to use our strengths and expertise to exceed customer expectations by consistently delivering the best national program available 
historically we have not always changed the trade names of the local businesses we acquired  and therefore we do not operate nationally under any one mark or trade name 
customers we provide services to a broad base of commercial  industrial  municipal and residential customers 
no single customer has individually accounted for more than of our consolidated revenue or of our reportable segment revenue in any of the last three years 

table of contents competition although we operate in a highly competitive industry  entry into our business and the ability to operate profitably require substantial amounts of capital and managerial experience 
competition in the non hazardous solid waste industry comes from a few other large  national publicly owned companies  including waste management  inc  several regional publicly and privately owned solid waste companies  and thousands of small privately owned companies 
in any given market  competitors may have larger operations and greater resources 
in addition to national and regional firms and numerous local companies  we compete with municipalities that maintain waste collection or disposal operations 
these municipalities may have financial advantages due to the availability of tax revenue and tax exempt financing 
we compete for collection accounts primarily on the basis of price and the quality of our services 
from time to time  our competitors reduce the price of their services in an effort to expand market share or to win a competitively bid municipal contract 
our ability to maintain and increase prices in certain markets may be impacted by our competitors pricing policies 
this may have an impact on our future revenue and profitability 
seasonality and severe weather our operations can be adversely affected by periods of inclement or severe weather  which could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts without corresponding compensation  delay the collection and disposal of waste  reduce the volume of waste delivered to our disposal sites  or delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites and other facilities 
our operations also can be favorably affected by severe weather  which could increase the volume of waste in situations where we are able to charge for our additional services 
regulation our facilities and operations are subject to a variety of federal  state and local requirements that regulate the environment  public health  safety  zoning and land use 
operating and other permits  licenses and other approvals generally are required for landfills and transfer stations  certain solid waste collection vehicles  fuel storage tanks and other facilities that we own or operate 
these permits are subject to denial  revocation  modification and renewal in certain circumstances 
federal  state and local laws and regulations vary  but generally govern wastewater or storm water discharges  air emissions  the handling  transportation  treatment  storage and disposal of hazardous and non hazardous waste  and the remediation of contamination associated with the release or threatened release of hazardous substances 
these laws and regulations provide governmental authorities with strict powers of enforcement  which include the ability to revoke or decline to renew any of our operating permits  obtain injunctions  or impose fines or penalties in the event of violations  including criminal penalties 
the us environmental protection agency epa and various other federal  state and local authorities administer these regulations 
we strive to conduct our operations in compliance with applicable laws  regulations and permits 
however  from time to time we have been issued citations or notices from governmental authorities that have resulted in the need to expend funds for remedial work and related activities at various landfills and other facilities 
we cannot assure you that citations and notices will not be issued in the future despite our regulatory compliance efforts 
we have established final capping  closure  post closure and remediation reserves that we believe  based on currently available information  will be adequate to cover our current estimates of regulatory costs 
however  we cannot assure you that actual costs will not exceed our reserves 
federal regulation 
the following summarizes the primary federal environmental and occupational health and safety related statutes that affect our facilities and operations the solid waste disposal act  including the resource conservation and recovery act rcra 
rcra establishes a framework for regulating the handling  transportation  treatment  storage and disposal of 
table of contents hazardous and non hazardous solid waste  and requires states to develop programs to ensure the safe disposal of solid waste in sanitary landfills 
subtitle d of rcra establishes a framework for regulating the disposal of municipal solid waste 
regulations under subtitle d currently include minimum comprehensive solid waste management criteria and guidelines  including location restrictions  facility design and operating criteria  final capping  closure and post closure requirements  financial assurance standards  groundwater monitoring requirements and corrective action standards 
all of the states in which we operate have implemented permit programs pursuant to rcra and subtitle d 
these state permit programs may include landfill requirements which are more stringent than those of subtitle d 
our failure to comply with the implementation of federal environmental requirements by state and local authorities at any of our locations may lead to temporary or permanent loss of an operating permit  which would result in costs in connection with securing new permits and reduced revenue from lost operational time 
all of our planned landfill expansions and new landfill development projects have been engineered to meet or exceed subtitle d requirements 
operating and design criteria for existing operations have been modified to comply with these regulations 
compliance with subtitle d regulations has resulted in increased costs and may in the future require substantial additional expenditures in addition to other costs normally associated with our waste management activities 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of cercla 
cercla  among other things  provides for the cleanup of sites from which there is a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
cercla may impose strict joint and several liability for the costs of cleanup and for damages to natural resources upon current owners and operators of a site  parties who were owners or operators of a site at the time the hazardous substances were disposed of  parties who transported the hazardous substances to a site  and parties who arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at a site 
under the authority of cercla and its implementing regulations  detailed requirements apply to the manner and degree of investigation and remediation of facilities and sites where hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released into the environment 
liability under cercla is not dependent on the existence or disposal of only hazardous wastes  but also can be based upon the existence of small quantities of more than substances characterized by the epa as hazardous  many of which are found in common household waste 
among other things  cercla authorizes the federal government to investigate and remediate sites at which hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released into the environment or to order persons potentially liable for the cleanup of the hazardous substances to do so themselves 
in addition  the epa has established a national priorities list of sites at which hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released and which require investigation or cleanup 
cercla liability is strict liability 
it can be founded upon the release or threatened release  even as a result of unintentional  non negligent or lawful action  of hazardous substances  including very small quantities of such substances 
thus  even if we have never knowingly transported or received hazardous substances  it is likely that hazardous substances have been deposited or released at landfills or other facilities that we presently or historically have owned or operated  or at properties owned by third parties to which we have transported waste 
therefore  we could be liable under cercla for the cost of cleaning up such hazardous substances at such sites and for damages to natural resources  even if those substances were deposited at our facilities before we acquired or operated them 
the costs of a cercla cleanup can be very expensive and can include the costs of disposing of hazardous substances at appropriately licensed facilities 
given the difficulty of obtaining insurance for environmental impairment liability  such liability could have a material impact on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the federal water pollution control act of the clean water act 
this act regulates the discharge of pollutants from a variety of sources  including solid waste disposal sites  into streams  rivers and other 
table of contents waters of the united states 
runoff from our landfills and transfer stations that is discharged into surface waters through discrete conveyances must be covered by discharge permits that generally require us to conduct sampling and monitoring  and  under certain circumstances  to reduce the quantity of pollutants in those discharges 
storm water discharge regulations under the clean water act require a permit for certain construction activities and for runoff from industrial operations and facilities  which may affect our operations 
if a landfill or transfer station discharges wastewater through a sewage system to a publicly owned treatment works  the facility must comply with discharge limits imposed by that treatment works 
in addition  states may adopt groundwater protection programs under the clean water act or the safe drinking water act that could affect the manner in which our solid waste landfills monitor and control their waste management activities 
furthermore  if development at any of our facilities alters or affects wetlands  we may be required to secure permits before such development starts 
in these situations  permitting agencies may require mitigation of wetland impacts 
the clean air act 
the clean air act imposes limitations on emissions from various sources  including landfills 
in march  the epa promulgated regulations that require large municipal solid waste landfills to install landfill gas monitoring systems 
these regulations apply to landfills that commenced construction  reconstruction or modification on or after may   and  principally  to landfills that can accommodate million cubic meters or more of municipal solid waste 
the regulations apply whether the landfills are active or closed 
the date by which each affected landfill must have a gas collection and control system installed and made operational varies depending on calculated emission rates at the landfill 
efforts to curtail the emission of greenhouse gases and to ameliorate the effect of climate change may require our landfills to deploy more stringent emission controls and monitoring systems  with resulting capital or operating costs 
many state regulatory agencies also currently require monitoring systems for the collection and control of certain landfill gas 
certain of these state agencies are also implementing greenhouse gas control regulations that would also apply to landfill gas emissions 
see item a  risk factors regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could impose costs on our operations  the magnitude of which we cannot yet estimate  in this form k 
in addition  our vehicle fleet also may become subject to higher efficiency standards or other carbon emission restrictions 
over the past two years  epa and the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa have adopted regulations mandating the reduction of vehicle tail pipe emissions as a means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions 
the regulations take the form of fuel economy standards 
epa and nhtsa have developed fuel economy standards in two vehicle categories conventional automobiles and light duty trucks  and heavy duty tucks  including solid waste collection vehicles and tractor trailers 
we own and operate vehicles in both categories 
for conventional automobiles and light duty trucks  in may epa and nhtsa finalized fuel economy standards for model years through in october  epa and nhtsa initiated a second round of rulemaking for conventional automobiles and pick up trucks in model years through in august  epa and nhtsa finalized standards for heavy duty trucks  including solid waste collection vehicles and tractor trailers  for model years through in issuing the fuel economy standards for heavy duty trucks and tractor trailers  the government estimated the standards would increase the cost of the average tractor trailer by approximately  but that the vehicle would save fuel costs over its operating life 
the occupational safety and health act of osha 
this act authorizes the occupational safety and health administration of the us department of labor to promulgate occupational safety and health standards 
a number of these standards  including standards for notices of hazardous chemicals and the handling of asbestos  apply to our facilities and operations 
state and local regulation 
each state in which we operate has its own laws and regulations governing solid waste disposal  water and air pollution  and  in most cases  releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and liabilities for such matters 
states also have adopted regulations governing the design  operation  maintenance and closure of landfills and transfer stations 
some counties  municipalities and other local governments have 
table of contents adopted similar laws and regulations 
in addition  our operations may be affected by the trend in many states toward requiring solid waste reduction and recycling programs 
for example  several states have enacted laws that require counties or municipalities to adopt comprehensive plans to reduce  through solid waste planning  composting  recycling or other programs  the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills 
additionally  laws and regulations restricting the disposal of certain waste in solid waste landfills  including yard waste  newspapers  beverage containers  unshredded tires  lead acid batteries  electronic wastes and household appliances  have been adopted in several states and are being considered in others 
legislative and regulatory measures to mandate or encourage waste reduction at the source and waste recycling also have been or are under consideration by the us congress and the epa 
to construct  operate and expand a landfill  we must obtain one or more construction or operating permits  as well as zoning and land use approvals 
these permits and approvals may be burdensome to obtain and to comply with  are often opposed by neighboring landowners and citizens groups  may be subject to periodic renewal  and are subject to denial  modification  non renewal and revocation by the issuing agency 
significant compliance disclosure obligations often accompany these processes 
in connection with our acquisition of existing landfills  we may be required to spend considerable time  effort and money to bring the acquired facilities into compliance with applicable requirements and to obtain the permits and approvals necessary to increase their capacity 
other regulations 
many of our facilities own and operate underground storage tanks that are generally used to store petroleum based products 
these tanks are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations that mandate their periodic testing  upgrading  closure and removal 
in the event of leaks or releases from these tanks  these regulations require that polluted groundwater and soils be remediated 
we believe that all of our underground storage tanks meet all applicable regulations 
if underground storage tanks we own or operate leak  we could be liable for response costs and  if the leakage migrates onto the property of others  we could be liable for damages to third parties 
we are unaware of facts indicating that issues of compliance with regulations related to underground storage tanks will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
with regard to our solid waste transportation operations  we are subject to the jurisdiction of the surface transportation board and are regulated by the federal highway administration  office of motor carriers  and by regulatory agencies in states that regulate such matters 
various state and local government authorities have adopted  or are considering adopting  laws and regulations that would restrict the transportation of solid waste across state  county  or other jurisdiction lines 
in  the us supreme court ruled that a law that restricts the importation of out of state solid waste is unconstitutional  however  states have attempted to distinguish proposed laws from those involved in and implicated by that ruling 
in  the supreme court ruled that a flow control law  which attempted to restrict solid waste from leaving its place of generation  imposes an impermissible burden upon interstate commerce and is unconstitutional 
in  however  the us supreme court upheld the right of a local government to direct the flow of solid waste to a publicly owned and publicly operated waste facility 
a number of county and other local jurisdictions have enacted ordinances or other regulations restricting the free movement of solid waste across jurisdictional boundaries 
other governments may enact similar regulations in the future 
these regulations may  in some cases  cause a decline in volumes of waste delivered to our landfills or transfer stations and may increase our costs of disposal  thereby adversely affecting our operations and our financial results 
liabilities established for landfill and environmental costs 
we have established reserves for landfill and environmental costs  which include landfill site final capping  closure and post closure costs 
we periodically reassess such costs based on various methods and assumptions regarding landfill airspace and the technical requirements of subtitle d of rcra  and we adjust our rates used to expense final capping  closure and post closure costs accordingly 
based on current information and regulatory requirements  we believe that our recorded reserves for such landfill and environmental expenditures are adequate 
however  environmental laws may change  and we cannot assure you that our recorded reserves will be adequate to cover requirements under existing or new environmental laws and regulations  future changes or interpretations of existing laws and regulations  or adverse environmental conditions previously unknown to us 
refer to the contractual obligations 
table of contents table within item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  contained elsewhere in this form k for further information 
liability insurance and bonding the nature of our business exposes us to the risk of liabilities arising out of our operations  including possible damages to the environment 
such potential liabilities could involve  for example  claims for remediation costs  personal injury  property damage and damage to the environment in cases where we may be held responsible for the escape of harmful materials  claims of employees  customers or third parties for personal injury or property damage occurring in the course of our operations  or claims alleging negligence or other wrongdoing in the planning or performance of work 
we also could be subject to fines and civil and criminal penalties in connection with alleged violations of regulatory requirements 
because of the nature and scope of the possible environmental damages  liabilities imposed in environmental litigation can be significant 
our solid waste operations have third party environmental liability insurance with limits in excess of those required by permit regulations  subject to certain limitations and exclusions 
however  we cannot assure you that such environmental liability insurance would be adequate  in scope or amount  in the event of a major loss  nor can we assure you that we would continue to carry excess environmental liability insurance should market conditions in the insurance industry make such coverage costs prohibitive 
we maintain general liability  vehicle liability  employment practices liability  pollution liability  directors and officers liability  workers compensation and employer s liability coverage  as well as umbrella liability policies to provide excess coverage over the underlying limits contained in these primary policies 
we also carry property insurance 
although we try to operate safely and prudently we have  subject to limitations and exclusions  substantial liability insurance  we cannot assure you that we will not be exposed to uninsured liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our insurance programs for workers compensation  general liability  vehicle liability  and employee related health care benefits are effectively self insured 
claims in excess of self insurance levels are insured subject to the excess policy limits and exclusions 
accruals are based on claims filed and actuarial estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported 
due to the variable condition of the insurance market  we have experienced  and may experience in the future  increased self insurance retention levels and increased premiums 
as we assume more risk for self insurance through higher retention levels  we may experience more variability in our self insurance reserves and expense 
in the normal course of business  we post performance bonds  insurance policies  letters of credit  or cash or marketable securities deposits in connection with municipal residential collection contracts  closure and post closure of landfills  environmental remediation  environmental permits  and business licenses and permits as a financial guarantee of our performance 
to date  we have satisfied financial responsibility requirements by making cash or marketable securities deposits or by obtaining bank letters of credit  insurance policies or surety bonds 
employees as of december   we employed approximately  full time employees  approximately of whom were covered by collective bargaining agreements 
from time to time  our operating locations may experience union organizing efforts 
we have not historically experienced any significant work stoppages 
we currently have no disputes or bargaining circumstances that we believe could cause significant disruptions in our business 
our management believes we have good relations with our employees

these statements include statements about our plans  strategies and prospects 
forward looking statements are not guarantees of performance 
these statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of our management and are subject to risk and uncertainties  including the risks set forth below in these risk factors  which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in  or implied or projected by  the forward looking information and statements 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements are reasonable  we cannot assure you that the expectations will prove to be correct 
according  you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date of this form k 
except to the extent required by applicable law or regulation  we undertake no obligation to update or publish revised forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this form k or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
we have substantial indebtedness  which may limit our financial flexibility 
as of december   we had approximately billion in principal value of debt and capital leases outstanding 
this amount of indebtedness and our debt service requirements may limit our financial flexibility to access additional capital and make capital expenditures and other investments in our business  to withstand economic downturns and interest rate increases  to plan for or react to changes in our business and our industry  and to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants of our debt instruments 
further  our ability to comply with the financial and other covenants contained in our debt instruments may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions or other events that are beyond our control 
if we do not comply with these covenants and restrictions  we may be required to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures  reducing or eliminating dividends or stock repurchases  selling assets  restructuring or refinancing all or part of our existing debt  or seeking additional equity capital 
general economic conditions can directly and adversely affect our operating results 
our business is directly affected by changes in national and general economic factors and overall economic activity that are outside of our control  including consumer confidence and interest rates 
a weak economy generally results in decreases in volumes of waste generated  which adversely affects our revenues 
in addition  we have a relatively high fixed cost structure  which is difficult to adjust quickly to match declining waste volume levels 
consumer uncertainty and the loss of consumer confidence may decrease overall economic activity and thereby limit the amount of services requested by our customers 
additionally  the decline in waste volumes may result in increased competitive pricing pressure and increased customer turnover  resulting in lower revenue and increased operating costs 
recent and continuing economic conditions have negatively impacted the portion of our collection business servicing commercial and industrial accounts in general and the manufacturing 
table of contents and construction industries in particular 
we cannot assure you that worsening economic conditions would not have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
further  recovery in the solid waste industry historically has lagged behind recovery in the general economy 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that an improvement in general economic conditions will result in an immediate  or any  improvement in our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the weak us economy may expose us to credit risk for amounts due from governmental agencies  large national accounts  industrial customers and others 
the weak us economy has reduced the amount of taxes collected by various governmental agencies 
we provide services to a number of these agencies  including numerous municipalities 
these governmental agencies may suffer financial difficulties resulting from a decrease in tax revenue and may ultimately be unable or unwilling to pay amounts owed to us 
in addition  the weak economy may cause other customers  including our large national accounts or industrial clients  to suffer financial difficulties and ultimately to be unable or unwilling to pay amounts owed to us 
this could have a negative impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the waste industry is highly competitive and includes competitors that may have greater financial and operational resources  flexibility to reduce prices or other competitive advantages that could make it difficult for us to compete effectively 
we principally compete with large national waste management companies  numerous municipalities  and numerous regional and local companies 
competition for collection accounts is primarily based on price and the quality of services 
competition for disposal business is primarily based on price  geographic location and quality of operations 
one of our competitors may have greater financial and operational resources than we do 
further  many counties and municipalities that operate their own waste collection and disposal facilities have the benefits of tax revenue or tax exempt financing 
our ability to obtain solid waste volume for our landfills also may be limited by the fact that some major collection operations also own or operate landfills to which they send their waste 
in markets in which we do not own or operate a landfill  our collection operations may operate at a disadvantage to fully integrated competitors 
as a result of these factors  from time to time we may have difficulty competing effectively in certain markets 
if we were to lose market share or if we were to lower prices to address competitive issues  it could negatively impact our revenues and profitability 
price increases may not be adequate to offset the impact of increased costs and may cause us to lose volume 
we seek to secure price increases necessary to offset higher costs including fuel and environmental costs  to maintain or improve operating margins  and to obtain adequate returns on our substantial investments in assets such as our landfills 
from time to time  our competitors reduce their prices in an effort to expand their market share 
contractual  general economic or market specific conditions also may limit our ability to raise prices 
for example  many of our contracts have price adjustment provisions that are tied to an index such as the consumer price index 
particularly in a weak us economy such as the current one  our costs may increase in excess of the increase  if any  in the consumer price index 
this may continue to be the case even when the us economy recovers because a recovery in the solid waste industry historically has lagged behind a recovery in the general economy 
as a result  we may be unable to offset increases in costs  improve our operating margins and obtain adequate investment returns through price increases 
we also may lose volume to lower cost competitors 
increases in the cost of fuel or petrochemicals would increase our operating expenses  and we cannot assure you that we would be able to recover such cost increases from our customers 
we depend on fuel purchased in the open market to operate our collection and transfer trucks and other equipment used for collection  transfer  and disposal 
fuel prices are unpredictable and fluctuate significantly based on events beyond our control  including geopolitical developments  actions by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and other oil and gas producers  supply and demand for oil and gas  war  
table of contents terrorism and unrest in oil producing countries  and regional production patterns 
due to contractual or market factors  we may not be able to offset such volatility through fuel recovery fees 
for example  our fuel costs were million in  or of our revenue  compared to million in  or of our revenue 
to manage our exposure to volatility in fuel prices  we have entered into multiple swap agreements whereby we receive or make payments to counter parties should the price of fuel vary from a specified amount 
during  approximately of our fuel volume purchases were hedged with swap agreements 
additionally  we are able to collect fuel recovery fees from some customers 
for  we were able to recover approximately of our fuel costs with fuel recovery fees 
at our current consumption levels  a one cent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel costs by million on an annual basis  which would be partially offset by a smaller change in the fuel recovery fees charged to our customers 
accordingly  a substantial rise or drop in fuel costs could result in a material impact to our revenue and cost of operations 
over the last several years  regulations have been adopted mandating changes in the composition of fuels for motor vehicles 
the renewable fuel standards that epa sets annually affect the type of fuel our motor vehicle fleet uses 
pursuant to the energy independence and security act of  epa establishes annual renewable fuel volume requirements and separate volume requirements for four different categories of renewable fuels renewable fuel  advanced biofuel  cellulosic biofuel  and biomass based diesel 
these volume requirements set standards for the proportion of refiners or importers total fuel volume that must be renewable and must take into account the fuels impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions 
these regulations are one of many factors that may affect the cost of the fuel we use 
our operations also require the use of products such as liners at our landfills whose costs may vary with the price of petrochemicals 
an increase in the price of petrochemicals could increase the cost of those products  which would increase our operating and capital costs 
we are also susceptible to increases in indirect fuel recovery fees from our vendors 
fluctuations in prices for recycled commodities that we sell to customers may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we purchase or collect and process recyclable materials such as paper  cardboard  plastics  aluminum and other metals for sale to third parties 
our results of operations may be affected by changing prices or market requirements for recyclable materials 
the resale and purchase prices of  and market demand for  recyclable materials are volatile due to changes in economic conditions and numerous other factors beyond our control 
these fluctuations may affect our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
to manage our exposure to fluctuations in prices for recycled commodities  we have entered into multiple hedging arrangements whereby we receive or make payments to counter parties should the price of recycled commodities vary from a specified amount or range 
during  approximately of our tonnage sold was hedged with such arrangements 
at our current sales levels  a ten dollar per ton change in the sale price of recyclable materials changes our revenue and operating income by approximately million and million  respectively  on an annual basis 
accordingly  a substantial rise or drop in recycled commodity prices could result in a material impact to our revenue and cost of operations 
adverse weather conditions may limit our operations and increase the costs of collection and disposal 
our collection and landfill operations could be adversely impacted by extended periods of inclement weather  or by increased severity of weather and climate extremes resulting in the future from climate change 
any of this could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts without corresponding compensation  interfere with collection and landfill operations  delay the development of landfill capacity or reduce the volume of waste generated by our customers 
in addition  adverse weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of our operations  which can significantly affect our operating results in the affected regions during those periods 

table of contents we may be unable to maintain our credit ratings or execute our financial strategy 
our ability to execute our financial strategy depends in part on our ability to maintain investment grade ratings on our debt 
the credit rating process is contingent upon a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our investment grade ratings in the future 
if we were unable to do so  our interest expense would increase and our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms may be adversely affected 
our financial strategy also depends on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to reinvest in our existing business  fund internal growth  acquire other solid waste businesses  pay dividends  repurchase stock  reduce indebtedness and minimize borrowings  and take other actions to enhance stockholder value 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in executing our broad based pricing initiatives  that we will generate sufficient cash flow to execute our financial strategy  that we will be able to pay cash dividends at our present rate  or increase them  or that we will be able to continue our share repurchase program 
the solid waste industry is a capital intensive industry and our capital expenditures may exceed current expectations  which could require us to obtain additional funding for our operations or impair our ability to grow our business 
our ability to remain competitive and to grow and expand our operations largely depends on our cash flow from operations and access to capital 
if our capital efficiency programs cannot offset the impact of inflation and business growth  it may be necessary to increase the amount we spend 
additionally  if we make acquisitions or further expand our operations  the amount we spend on capital  capping  closure  post closure  environmental remediation and other items will increase 
our cash needs also will increase if the expenditures for capping  closure  post closure and remediation activities increase above our current estimates  which may occur over a long period due to changes in federal  state or local government requirements and other factors beyond our control 
increases in expenditures would negatively impact our cash flows 
we may be unable to obtain or maintain required permits or to expand existing permitted capacity of our landfills  which could decrease our revenue and increase our costs 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully obtain or maintain the permits we require to operate our business because permits to operate new landfills and to expand the permitted capacity of existing landfills have become more difficult and expensive to obtain and maintain 
permits often take years to obtain as a result of numerous hearings and compliance requirements with regard to zoning  environmental and other regulations 
these permits are also often subject to resistance from citizen or other groups and other political pressures 
local communities and citizen groups  adjacent landowners or governmental agencies may oppose the issuance of a permit or approval we may need  allege violations of the permits under which we currently operate or laws or regulations to which we are subject  or seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage 
responding to these challenges has at times increased our costs and extended the time associated with establishing new facilities and expanding existing facilities 
in addition  failure to receive regulatory and zoning approval may prohibit us from establishing new facilities or expanding existing facilities 
our failure to obtain the required permits to operate our non hazardous solid waste landfills could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  we may have to dispose collected waste at landfills operated by our competitors or haul the waste long distances at a higher cost to one of our other landfills  either of which could significantly increase our waste disposal costs 
if we do not appropriately estimate the cost of landfill capping  closure and post closure costs  our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
a landfill must be closed and capped  and post closure maintenance commenced  once the permitted capacity of the landfill is reached and additional capacity is not authorized 
we have significant financial obligations relating to capping  closure and post closure costs at our existing owned or operated landfills  and will have material 
table of contents financial obligations with respect to any future owned or operated landfills 
we establish accruals for the estimated costs associated with capping  closure and post closure financial obligations 
we could underestimate such costs  and our financial obligations for capping  closure or post closure costs could exceed the amount accrued or amounts otherwise receivable pursuant to trust funds established for this purpose 
such a shortfall could result in significant unanticipated charges to income 
additionally  if a landfill must be closed earlier than expected or its remaining airspace is reduced for any other reason  the accruals for capping  closure and post closure could be required to be accelerated  which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
alternatives to landfill disposal could reduce our disposal volumes and cause our revenues and operating results to decline 
most of the states in which we operate landfills require counties and municipalities to formulate comprehensive plans to reduce the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills through waste planning  composting and recycling  or other programs 
some state and local governments mandate waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of wastes  such as yard waste  at landfills 
further  many of our customers voluntarily are diverting waste to alternatives to landfill disposal  such as recycling and composting  while also working to reduce the amount of waste they generate 
many of the largest companies in the us are setting zero waste goals in which they strive to send no waste to landfills 
although such actions help to protect our environment  they have reduced and will in the future reduce the volume of waste going to landfills and may affect the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that we will be able to operate our landfills at their current volumes or charge current prices for landfill disposal services due to the decrease in demand for such services 
if we cannot expand our service offerings and grow lines of business to service waste streams that do not go to landfills and to provide services for customers that wish to reduce waste entirely  this could have a negative impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
further  even if we can develop service offerings and lines of business  disposal alternatives nonetheless could have a negative impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the possibility of landfill and transfer station site development projects  expansion projects or pending acquisitions not being completed or certain other events could result in material charges to income 
in accordance with us gaap  we capitalize certain expenditures relating to development  expansion  acquisition and other projects 
if a facility or operation is permanently shut down or determined to be impaired  or a development  expansion or other project is not completed or is determined to be impaired  we will charge against earnings any unamortized capitalized expenditures relating to such facility or project that we are unable to recover through sale  transfer or otherwise 
we also carry a significant amount of goodwill on our consolidate balance sheets  which we must assess for impairment annually  and more frequently in the case of certain triggering events 
we may incur charges against earnings in accordance with this policy  or other events may cause impairments 
such charges could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
we are subject to costly environmental regulations and flow control regulations that may affect our operating margins  restrict our operations and subject us to additional liability 
complying with laws and regulations governing the use  treatment  storage  transfer and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and materials  air quality  water quality and the remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances is costly 
laws and regulations often require us to enhance or replace our equipment and to modify landfill operations or initiate final closure of a landfill 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to implement price increases sufficient to offset the costs of complying with these laws and regulations 
in addition  environmental regulatory changes could accelerate or increase expenditures for capping  closure and post closure  and environmental and remediation activities at solid waste facilities and obligate us to spend sums in addition to those presently accrued for such purposes 

table of contents our collection  transfer  and landfill operations are  and may in the future continue to be  affected by state or local laws or regulations that restrict the transportation of solid waste across state  county or other jurisdictional lines or that direct the flow of waste to a specified facility 
such laws and regulations could negatively affect our operations  resulting in declines in landfill volumes and increased costs of alternate disposal 
in addition to the costs of complying with environmental regulations  we incur costs to defend against litigation brought by government agencies and private parties who allege we are in violation of our permits and applicable environmental laws and regulations  or who assert claims alleging environmental damage  personal injury or property damage 
as a result  we may be required to pay fines or implement corrective measures  or we may have our permits and licenses modified or revoked 
a significant judgment against us  the loss of a significant permit or license  or the imposition of a significant fine could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we establish accruals for our estimates of the costs associated with our environmental obligations 
we could underestimate such accruals and remediation costs could exceed amounts accrued 
such shortfalls could result in significant unanticipated charges to income 
regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could impose costs on our operations  the magnitude of which we cannot yet estimate 
efforts to curtail the emission of greenhouse gases and to ameliorate the effects of climate change continue to be debated on the federal  regional  and state level 
our landfill operations emit methane  identified as a greenhouse gas  and our vehicle fleets emit  among others  carbon dioxide  which also has been identified as a greenhouse gas 
conventional wisdom now suggests that passage of comprehensive  federal climate change legislation is highly unlikely 
nonetheless  should comprehensive federal climate change legislation be enacted  we expect it to impose costs on our operations  the materiality of which we cannot predict 
absent comprehensive federal legislation to control greenhouse gas emissions  epa is moving ahead administratively under its existing clean air act authority 
epa is compelled to issue rules by the us supreme court s april massachusetts v 
epa ruling that greenhouse gases are pollutants for purposes of the clean air act and epa s december finding that continued emissions of greenhouse gases endanger human health and welfare 
one applicable rule is epa s may prevention of significant deterioration and title v greenhouse gas tailoring rule tailoring rule 
the tailoring rule sets levels of greenhouse gas emissions at new or modified stationary emission sources that trigger permit and control obligations 
epa s authority to issue the tailoring rule has been challenged in court  and the outcome of that court challenge is uncertain 
moreover  in july epa issued a rule deferring the application of the tailoring rule to solid waste landfills for three years 
we cannot assure you that eventual application of the tailoring rule to our landfills will not have a material effect on our landfill operations or on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
we may have environmental liabilities that are not covered by our insurance 
changes in insurance markets also may impact our financial results 
we may incur liabilities for the deterioration of the environment as a result of our operations 
we maintain high deductibles for our environmental liability insurance coverage 
if we were to incur substantial liability for environmental damage  our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover such liability 
this could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
also  due to the variable condition of the insurance market  we may experience future increases in self insurance levels as a result of increased retention levels and increased premiums 
as we assume more risk for self insurance through higher retention levels  we may experience more variability in our self insurance reserves and expense 

table of contents despite our efforts  we may incur additional hazardous substances liability in excess of amounts presently known and accrued 
we are a potentially responsible party at many sites under cercla  which provides for the remediation of contaminated facilities and imposes strict  joint and several liability for the cost of remediation on current owners and operators of a facility at which there has been a release or a threatened release of a hazardous substance 
cercla liability also extends to parties who were site owners and operators at the time hazardous substances were disposed  and on persons who arrange for the disposal of such substances at the facility ie  generators of the waste and transporters who selected the disposal site 
hundreds of substances are defined as hazardous under cercla and their presence  even in minute amounts  can result in substantial liability 
notwithstanding our efforts to comply with applicable regulations and to avoid transporting and receiving hazardous substances  we may have additional liability under cercla  or similar state laws or rcra  in excess of our current reserves because such substances may be present in waste collected by us or disposed of in our landfills  or in waste collected  transported or disposed of in the past by companies we have acquired 
actual costs for these liabilities could be significantly greater than amounts presently accrued for these purposes  which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
currently pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences  including judgments or settlements 
we are  and from time to time become  involved in lawsuits  regulatory inquiries  and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business 
many of these matters raise difficult and complicated factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties and complexities 
the timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits  regulatory inquiries  and governmental and other legal proceedings is uncertain 
further  the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements  either of which could require substantial payments and adversely affect our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we may be unable to manage our growth effectively 
our growth strategy places significant demands on our financial  operational and management resources 
to continue our growth  we may need to add administrative and other personnel  and may need to make additional investments in operations and systems 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to find and train qualified personnel  or do so on a timely basis  or expand our operations and systems to the extent  and in the time  required 
we may be unable to execute our acquisition growth strategy 
our ability to execute our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to identify and acquire desirable acquisition candidates and on our ability to successfully consolidate acquired operations into our business 
the consolidation of our operations with those of acquired companies may present significant challenges to our management 
in addition  competition among our competitors for acquisition candidates may prevent us from acquiring certain acquisition candidates 
thus  we cannot assure you that desirable acquisition candidates exist or will be identified  we will be able to acquire any of the candidates identified  we will effectively consolidate companies we acquire  or any acquisitions will be profitable or accretive to our earnings 
if any of these factors force us to alter our growth strategy  our growth prospects could be adversely affected 

table of contents businesses we acquire may have undisclosed liabilities 
in pursuing our acquisition strategy  our due diligence investigations of the acquisition candidates may fail to discover certain undisclosed liabilities 
if we acquire a company having undisclosed liabilities such as environmental  remediation or contractual  as a successor owner we may be responsible for such undisclosed liabilities 
we try to minimize our exposure to such liabilities when we can by conducting due diligence  by obtaining indemnification from each sellers of the acquired companies  by deferring payment of a portion of the purchase price as security for the indemnification and by acquiring only specified assets 
however  we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain indemnification or that any indemnification obtained will be enforceable  collectible or sufficient in amount  scope or duration to fully offset any undisclosed liabilities arising from our acquisitions 
our consolidated financial statements are based on estimates and assumptions that will differ from actual results 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap and necessarily include amounts based on management s estimates 
actual results will differ from these amounts 
significant items requiring management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain include the recoverability of long lived assets  the depletion and amortization of landfill development costs  accruals for final capping  closure and post closure costs  valuation allowances for accounts receivable and deferred tax assets  liabilities for potential litigation  claims and assessments  and liabilities for environmental remediation  employee benefit and pension plans  deferred taxes  uncertain tax positions and self insurance 
we cannot assure you that the liabilities recorded for landfill and environmental costs will be adequate to cover the requirements of existing environmental regulations  future changes to or interpretations of existing regulations  or the identification of adverse environmental conditions previously unknown to management 
the introduction of new accounting rules  laws or regulations could adversely impact our results of operations 
complying with new accounting rules  laws or regulations could adversely impact our results of operations or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our results of operations in future periods 
we may be subject to workforce influences  including work stoppages  which could increase our operating costs and disrupt our operations 
as of december   approximately of our workforce was represented by various local labor unions 
if our unionized workers were to engage in strikes  work stoppages or other slowdowns  we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and an increase in our operating costs  which could have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
additional groups of employees may seek union representation in the future and  if successful  the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements could divert management attention and result in increased operating costs 
if a greater percentage of our workforce becomes unionized  our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted due to the potential for increased operating costs 
our obligation to fund multi employer pension plans to which we contribute may have an adverse impact on us 
we contribute to at least multi employer pension plans covering at least of our current employees 
we do not administer these plans and generally are not represented on the boards of trustees of these plans 
the pension protection act enacted in the ppa requires under funded pension plans to improve their funding ratios 
based on the information available to us  we believe that some of the multi employer plans to which we contribute are either critical or endangered as those terms are defined in the ppa 
we cannot determine at this time the amount of additional funding  if any  we may be required to make to these plans and  therefore  have 
table of contents not recorded any related liabilities 
however  plan assessments could have an adverse impact on our results of operations or cash flows for a given period 
furthermore  under current law  upon the termination of a multi employer pension plan  or in the event of a withdrawal by us which we consider from time to time or a mass withdrawal of contributing employers each  a withdrawal event  we would be required to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the plan s unfunded vested liabilities 
we cannot assure you that there will not be a withdrawal event with respect to any of the multi employer pension plans to which we contribute or that  in the event of such a withdrawal event  the amounts we would be required to contribute would not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
for additional discussion and detail regarding multi employer pension plans see note  employee benefit plans  to our consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
the costs of providing for pension benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes in pension fund values and fluctuating actuarial assumptions  and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows 
we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan that is funded with trustee assets invested in a diversified portfolio of debt and equity securities 
our costs for providing such benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes in the market value of plan assets 
our pension expenses and related funding requirements are also subject to various actuarial calculations and assumptions  which may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  interest rates and other factors 
a significant increase in our pension obligations and funding requirements could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and growth prospects 
our future success depends on the continued contributions of several key employees and officers 
the loss of the services of key employees and officers  whether such loss is through resignation or other causes  or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and growth prospects

we accrue for legal proceedings when losses become probable and reasonably estimable 
we have recorded an aggregate accrual of approximately million relating to our outstanding legal proceedings as of december   including those described herein and others not specifically identified herein

if we are able to reasonably estimate a range but no amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other  we use the amount that is the low end of such range

guidance our objectives for remain consistent with previous years and focus on enhancing stockholder value by increasing returns on invested capital and efficiently using free cash flow 
we remain committed to continuing our broad based pricing initiatives across all lines of business to recover increasing costs and to expand our operating margins 
our guidance is based on current economic conditions and does not assume any improvement or deterioration in the overall economy in specific guidance follows revenue we expect revenue to increase by approximately to 
this consists of the following increase decrease core price to volume fuel recovery fees recycling commodities acquisitions divestitures  net total change to changes in price are restricted on approximately of our annual revenue 
these restrictions include price changes based upon fluctuation in a specific index as defined in the contract  fixed price increases based on stated contract terms  or price changes based on a cost plus a specific profit margin or other measurement 
of these restricted pricing arrangements  approximately are based on a consumer price index  are fixed arrangements and the remainder are based upon a cost plus or other specific arrangement 
the consumer price index varies from a single historical stated period of time or an average of trailing historical rates over a stated period of time 
in addition  many pricing resets lag between the measurement period and the date the revised pricing goes into effect 
as a result  current changes in a specific index  such as the consumer price index  may not manifest themselves in our reported pricing for several quarters into the future

property and equipment in  we anticipate receiving approximately million of property and equipment as follows trucks and equipment landfill containers facilities and other property and equipment received during purchases of property and equipment as reflected on our consolidated statement of cash flows for are expected to be approximately million 
the difference between property and equipment received and purchases of property and equipment is approximately million of property and equipment received during but paid for in results of operations years ended december   and revenue we generate revenue primarily from our solid waste collection operations 
our remaining revenue is from other services  including transfer stations  landfill disposal and recycling 
our revenue from collection operations consists of fees we receive from commercial  industrial  municipal and residential customers 
our residential and commercial collection operations in some markets are based on long term contracts with municipalities 
we generally provide commercial and industrial collection services to customers under contracts with terms up to three years 
our transfer stations  landfills and  to a lesser extent  our material recovery facilities generate revenue from disposal or tipping fees 
in general  we integrate our recycling operations with our collection operations and obtain revenue from the sale of recyclable materials 
other revenue consists primarily of revenue from national accounts 
national accounts revenue represents the portion of revenue generated from nationwide contracts in markets outside our operating areas  where the associated waste handling services are subcontracted to local operators 
consequently  substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs  which are recorded in cost of operations

thus  you should take care when comparing our cost of operations by cost component to that of other companies 
cost of operations versus our cost of operations  as a percentage of revenue  increased in compared to  primarily as a result of the following an increase in fuel expenses of million  or year over year 
the average fuel price per gallon for was  an increase of or approximately from an average price of for at our current consumption levels  a one cent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel costs by approximately million on an annual basis  which would be partially offset by a smaller change in the fuel recovery fees charged to our customers 
accordingly  a substantial rise or drop in fuel costs could result in a material impact to our revenue and cost of operations 
an increase in cost of goods sold primarily due to changes in the market price of recycling commodities and an increase in volumes processed year over year 
the average price for old corrugated cardboard occ for was per ton versus per ton for the comparable period 
the average price of old newspaper onp for was per ton versus per ton for the comparable period 
at current volumes and mix of materials  we believe a ten dollar per ton change in the price of recyclable materials will change revenue and operating income by approximately million and million  respectively  on an annual basis 

table of contents these increases were partially offset by a decrease in labor and related benefits expenses due to volume related workforce reductions  including the expiration of the san mateo contract  as well as increased productivity gains primarily due to the automation of our residential fleet and lower benefit plan costs 
partially offsetting these declines were increases in overall wages and increases in workforce due to acquisitions 
a decrease in transfer and disposal costs due to the divestiture of transfer stations in as well as overall lower collection volumes 
during  and  approximately  and  respectively  of the total waste volume that we collected was disposed at landfill sites that we own or operate internalization 
a decrease in transportation and subcontract costs primarily due to the expiration of our san mateo county contract and our transportation and disposal contract with the city of toronto and a decline in our overall collection volumes 
partially offsetting these decreases were increases due to fuel recovery fees related to project work with certain of our national accounts customers 
cost of operations versus our cost of operations  as a percentage of revenue  decreased for compared to  primarily as a result of the following transfer and disposal  maintenance and repair  and transportation and subcontract costs decreased versus the comparable period due to lower waste volumes and cost control measures 
risk management costs decreased during as we continued to experience favorable actuarial developments primarily attributable to our continued focus on safety 
these decreases were partially offset by fuel expenses increased by million  or  year over year 
the average fuel price per gallon for was  an increase of or approximately from an average price of for landfill operating costs increased by million  or  year over year 
during the year ended december   we recovered million of insurance proceeds related to remediation costs at the countywide facility  which reduced our landfill operating costs during that period 
there were no such recoveries during the remainder of the increase in landfill operating costs is due to adjustments recorded to remediation reserves

national accounts revenue included in corporate entities represents the portion of revenue generated from nationwide contracts in markets outside our operating areas  where the associated waste handling services are subcontracted to local operators 
consequently  substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs  which are recorded in cost of operations 
significant changes in the revenue and operating margins of our reportable segments comparing to and to are discussed in the following paragraphs

landfill and environmental matters our landfill costs include daily operating expenses  costs of capital for cell development  costs for final capping  closure and post closure  and the legal and administrative costs of ongoing environmental compliance 
daily operating expenses include leachate treatment and disposal  methane gas and groundwater monitoring and system maintenance  interim cap maintenance  and costs associated with applying daily cover materials 
we expense all indirect landfill development costs as they are incurred 
we use life cycle accounting and the units of consumption method to recognize certain direct landfill costs related to landfill development 
in life cycle accounting  certain direct costs are capitalized and charged to depletion expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace 
these costs include all costs to acquire and construct a site  including excavation  natural and synthetic liners  construction of leachate collection systems  installation of methane gas collection and monitoring systems  installation of groundwater monitoring wells  and other costs associated with the acquisition and development of the site 
obligations associated with final capping  closure and post closure are capitalized and amortized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed 
cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers 
these estimates are used by our operating and accounting personnel to adjust the rates we use to expense capitalized costs 
changes in these estimates primarily relate to changes in costs  available airspace  inflation and applicable regulations 
changes in available airspace include changes in engineering estimates  changes in design and changes due to the addition of airspace lying in expansion areas that we believe have a probable likelihood of being permitted 

table of contents available airspace the following tables reflect landfill airspace activity for active landfills owned or operated by us for the years ended december   and balance as of december  new expansions undertaken landfills acquired  net of divestitures permits granted  net of closures airspace consumed changes in engineering estimates balance as of december  cubic yards in millions permitted airspace probable expansion airspace total cubic yards in millions number of sites permitted airspace probable expansion airspace balance as of december  new expansions undertaken landfills acquired  net of divestitures permits granted  net of closures airspace consumed changes in engineering estimates balance as of december  cubic yards in millions permitted airspace probable expansion airspace total cubic yards in millions number of sites permitted airspace probable expansion airspace balance as of december  new expansions undertaken landfills acquired  net of divestitures permits granted  net of closures airspace consumed changes in engineering estimates balance as of december  cubic yards in millions permitted airspace probable expansion airspace total cubic yards in millions number of sites permitted airspace probable expansion airspace 
table of contents changes in engineering estimates typically include modifications to the available disposal capacity of a landfill based on a refinement of the capacity calculations resulting from updated information 
changes in design typically include significant modifications to a landfill s footprint or vertical slopes 
as of december   we owned or operated active solid waste landfills with total available disposal capacity estimated to be billion in place cubic yards 
total available disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated permitted airspace plus an estimate of probable expansion airspace 
engineers develop these estimates at least annually using information provided by annual aerial surveys 
as of december   total available disposal capacity is estimated to be billion in place cubic yards of permitted airspace plus billion in place cubic yards of probable expansion airspace 
before airspace included in an expansion area is determined to be probable expansion airspace and  therefore  included in our calculation of total available disposal capacity  it must meet all of our expansion criteria 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  landfill and environmental costs  to our consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for further information 
as of december   eight of our landfills met all of our criteria for including their probable expansion airspace in their total available disposal capacity 
at projected annual volumes  these landfills have an estimated remaining average site life of years  including probable expansion airspace 
the average estimated remaining life of all of our landfills is years 
we have other expansion opportunities that are not included in our total available airspace because they do not meet all of our criteria for probable expansion airspace

remediation and other charges for landfill matters in december  we finalized our purchase price allocation for the environmental liabilities we assumed as part of the allied acquisition 
these liabilities represent our estimate of costs to remediate sites that were previously owned or operated by allied or sites at which allied  or a predecessor company that it had acquired  had been identified as a potentially responsible party 
the remediation of these sites is in various stages of completion from having received an initial notice from a regulatory agency and commencing investigation to being in the final stages of post remedial monitoring

table of contents credit facilities in april  we amended and restated our billion revolving credit facility due april the amended and restated credit facility to increase the borrowing capacity to billion and to extend the maturity to april the amended and restated credit facility includes a feature that allows us to increase availability  at our option  by an aggregate amount up to million  through increased commitments from existing lenders or the addition of new lenders 
at our option  borrowings under the amended and restated credit facility bear interest at a base rate  or a eurodollar rate  plus an applicable margin based on our debt ratings all as defined in the agreements 
substantially all of our subsidiaries guarantee all obligations under the amended and restated credit facility 
contemporaneous with the execution of the amended and restated credit facility  we entered into amendment no 
to our existing billion credit facility the existing credit facility and  together with the amended and restated credit facility  the credit facilities  to reduce the commitments under the existing credit facility to billion and conform certain terms of the existing credit facility to those of the amended and restated credit facility 
amendment no 
does not extend the maturity date under the existing credit facility  which matures in september substantially all of our subsidiaries continue to guarantee all obligations under the existing credit facility 
as of december  and december   the interest rate for our borrowings under our credit facilities was and  respectively 
our credit facilities also are subject to facility fees based on applicable rates defined in the agreements and the aggregate commitments  regardless of usage 
availability under our credit facilities can be used for working capital  capital expenditures  letters of credit and other general corporate purposes 
as of december  and december   we had million and million of base rate prime and eurodollar rate borrowings  respectively 
we had million and  million of letters of credit using availability under our credit facilities  leaving  million and  million of availability under our credit facilities  at december  and december   respectively 
the agreements governing our credit facilities require us to comply with certain financial and other covenants 
we may pay dividends and repurchase common stock if we are in compliance with these covenants 
compliance with these covenants is a condition for any incremental borrowings under our credit facilities and failure to meet these covenants would enable the lenders to require repayment of any outstanding loans which would adversely affect our liquidity 
at december   our ebitda to interest ratio was compared to the minimum required by the covenants  and our total debt to ebitda ratio was compared to the maximum allowed by the covenants 
at december   we were in compliance with the covenants of the credit facilities  and we expect to be in compliance throughout ebitda  which is a non gaap measure  is calculated as defined in our credit facility agreements 
in this context  ebitda is used solely to provide information regarding the extent to which we are in compliance with debt covenants and is not comparable to ebitda used by other companies or used by us for other purposes 
we intend to use excess cash on hand and cash from operating activities to fund capital expenditures  acquisitions  dividend payments  share repurchases and debt repayments 
debt repayments may include purchases of our outstanding indebtedness in the secondary market or otherwise 
we believe that our excess cash  cash from operating activities and our availability to draw from our credit facilities provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and maturing obligations as they come due 
in the future we may choose to voluntarily retire certain portions of our outstanding debt before their maturity dates using cash from operations or additional borrowings 
early extinguishment of debt will result in an impairment charge in the period in which the debt is repaid 
the loss on early extinguishment of debt relates to premiums paid to effectuate the repurchase and the relative portion of unamortized note discounts and debt issue costs 

table of contents senior notes and debentures during  and  we completed financing transactions that resulted in cash paid for premiums and professional fees to repurchase debt as well as the non cash write off of unamortized debt discounts and deferred issuance costs

the notes are general senior unsecured obligations of our subsidiary guarantors 
we used the net proceeds from the notes as follows i million to redeem the senior notes due at a premium of million principal outstanding  ii million to redeem the senior notes due at a premium of million principal outstanding  and iii the remainder to reduce amounts outstanding under our credit facilities and for general corporate purposes 
during the first quarter of  we incurred a loss of million for premiums paid to repurchase debt  to write off unamortized debt discounts and for professional fees paid to effectuate the repurchase of the senior notes 
tax exempt financings as of december  and  we had  million and  million  respectively  of fixed and variable rate tax exempt financings outstanding with maturities ranging from to as of december  and  the total of the unamortized adjustment to fair value recorded in purchase accounting for the tax exempt financings assumed from allied was million and million  respectively  which is being amortized to interest expense over the remaining terms of the debt 
approximately of our tax exempt financings are remarketed quarterly  weekly or daily by a remarketing agent to effectively maintain a variable yield 
certain of these variable rate tax exempt financings are credit enhanced with letters of credit having terms in excess of one year issued by banks with investment grade credit ratings 
the holders of the bonds can put them back to the remarketing agent at the end of each interest period 
to date  the remarketing agents have been able to remarket our variable rate unsecured tax exempt bonds 
these bonds have been classified as long term because of our ability and intent to refinance them using availability under our credit facilities  if necessary 

table of contents as of december   we had million of restricted cash and marketable securities  of which million represented proceeds from the issuance of tax exempt bonds and other tax exempt financings and will be used to fund capital expenditures under the terms of the agreements 
restricted cash and marketable securities also include amounts held in trust as a financial guarantee of our performance 
fuel hedges we use derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to changes in diesel fuel prices 
we have entered into multiple agreements related to forecasted diesel fuel purchases 
the agreements qualified for  and were designated as  effective hedges of changes in the prices of forecasted diesel fuel purchases fuel hedges

during  approximately of our fuel volume purchases were hedged with swap agreements 
additionally  we were able to recover approximately of our fuel costs with fuel recovery fees from certain of our customers 
recycling commodity hedges revenue from sale of recycling commodities is primarily from sales of old corrugated cardboard occ and old newspaper onp 
we use derivative instruments such as swaps and costless collars designated as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to changes in prices of these commodities 
we have entered into multiple agreements related to the forecasted occ and onp sales 
the agreements qualified for  and were designated as  effective hedges of changes in the prices of certain forecasted recycling commodity sales recycling commodity hedges

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in millions year ending december  operating leases maturities of notes payable  capital leases and other long term debt final capping  closure and post closure remediation unconditional purchase commitments defined benefit pension plan total thereafter total we intend to use excess cash on hand and cash from operating activities to fund capital expenditures  acquisitions  dividend payments  share repurchases and debt repayments 
actual debt repayments may include purchases of our outstanding indebtedness in the secondary market or otherwise 
we believe that our excess cash  cash from operating activities and proceeds from our revolving credit facilities provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and maturing obligations as they come due 
in the future we may choose to voluntarily retire certain portions of our outstanding debt before their maturity dates using cash from operations or additional borrowings 
we also may explore opportunities in the capital markets to fund redemptions should market conditions be favorable 
the present value of capital lease obligations is included in our consolidated balance sheets 
the estimated remaining final capping  closure and post closure and remediation expenditures presented above are not inflated or discounted and reflect the estimated future payments for liabilities incurred and recorded as of december  unconditional purchase commitments consist primarily of i disposal related agreements which include fixed or minimum royalty payments  host agreements and take or pay and put or pay agreements and ii other obligations including committed capital expenditures and consulting service agreements 
debt covenants our credit facilities contain financial covenants 
we can pay dividends and repurchase common stock if we are in compliance with these covenants 
at december   we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants under our credit facilities 
we were also in compliance with the non financial covenants in the indentures relating to our senior notes as of december  we expect to be in compliance with our covenants during failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under our credit facilities  as well as the occurrence of certain material adverse events  would constitute defaults and would allow the lenders under our credit facilities to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the related agreements 
this could also have an adverse impact on the availability of financial assurances 
in addition  maturity acceleration on our credit facilities constitutes an event of default under our other debt instruments  including our senior notes  and  therefore  our senior notes would also be subject to acceleration of maturity 
if such acceleration were to occur  we would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the indebtedness 
we would likely have to seek an amendment under 
table of contents our credit facilities for relief from the financial covenants or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity  or asset sales  if necessary 
we may be unable to amend our credit facilities or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturities are accelerated 
financial assurance we must provide financial assurance to governmental agencies and a variety of other entities under applicable environmental regulations relating to our landfill operations for capping  closure and post closure costs  and related to our performance under certain collection  landfill and transfer station contracts 
we satisfy these financial assurance requirements by providing surety bonds  letters of credit  or insurance policies the financial assurance instruments  or trust deposits which are included in restricted cash and marketable securities 
the amount of the financial assurance requirements for capping  closure and post closure costs is determined by applicable state environmental regulations 
the financial assurance requirements for capping  closure and post closure costs may be associated with a portion of the landfill or the entire landfill 
generally  states require a third party engineering specialist to determine the estimated capping  closure and post closure costs that are used to determine the required amount of financial assurance for a landfill 
the amount of financial assurance required can  and generally will  differ from the obligation determined and recorded under us gaap 
the amount of the financial assurance requirements related to contract performance varies by contract 
additionally  we must provide financial assurance for our insurance program and collateral for certain performance obligations 
we do not expect a material increase in financial assurance requirements during  although the mix of financial assurance instruments may change 
these financial instruments are issued in the normal course of business and are not considered company indebtedness 
because we currently have no liability for the financial assurance instruments  they are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
however  we record capping  closure and post closure liabilities and self insurance liabilities as they are incurred 
the underlying obligations of the financial assurance instruments  in excess of those already reflected in our consolidated balance sheets  would be recorded if it is probable that we would be unable to fulfill our related obligations 
we do not expect this to occur 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet debt or similar obligations  other than financial assurance instruments and operating leases  that are not classified as debt 
we do not guarantee any third party debt 
free cash flow we define free cash flow  which is not a measure determined in accordance with us gaap  as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment  plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
our free cash flow for the years ended december   and is calculated as follows in millions cash provided by operating activities purchases of property and equipment proceeds from sales of property and equipment free cash flow for a discussion of the changes in the components of free cash flow  you should read our discussion regarding cash flows provided by operating activities and cash flows used in investing activities contained elsewhere in this form k 

table of contents purchases of property and equipment as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows and as presented in the free cash flow table above represent amounts paid during the period for such expenditures 
a reconciliation of property and equipment reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows to property and equipment received during the period for the years ended december   and is as follows in millions purchases of property and equipment per the consolidated statements of cash flows adjustments for property and equipment received during the prior period but paid for in the following period  net property and equipment received during the period the adjustments noted above do not affect our net change in cash and cash equivalents as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
we believe that the presentation of free cash flow provides useful information regarding our recurring cash provided by operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment received  plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment 
it also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy  which includes reinvesting in existing capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service  investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in our customer base and services provided  maintaining our investment grade rating and minimizing debt  paying cash dividends and repurchasing common stock  and maintaining and improving our market position through business optimization 
in addition  free cash flow is a key metric used to determine compensation 
the presentation of free cash flow has material limitations 
free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to such as debt service requirements and dividend payments 
our definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 
contingencies for a description of our contingencies  see note  income taxes  and note  commitments and contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
critical accounting judgments and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap and necessarily include certain estimates and judgments made by management 
the following is a list of accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows and that may require management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
such critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments are applicable to all of our operating segments 
we have noted examples of the residual accounting and business risks inherent in the accounting for these areas 
residual accounting and business risks are defined as the inherent risks that we face after the application of our policies and processes that are generally outside of our control or ability to forecast 
landfill accounting landfill operating costs are treated as period expenses and are not discussed further herein 
our landfill assets and liabilities fall into the following two categories  each of which requires accounting judgments and estimates landfill development costs that are capitalized as an asset 

table of contents landfill retirement obligations relating to our capping  closure and post closure liabilities which result in a corresponding landfill retirement asset 
landfill development costs we use life cycle accounting and the units of consumption method to recognize landfill development costs over the life of the site 
in life cycle accounting  all costs to acquire and construct a site are capitalized  and charged to expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace 
obligations associated with final capping  closure and post closure are also capitalized  and amortized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed 
cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers 
site permits 
in order to develop  construct and operate a landfill  we must obtain permits from various regulatory agencies at the local  state and federal levels 
the permitting process requires an initial site study to determine whether the location is feasible for landfill operations 
the initial studies are reviewed by our environmental management group and then submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval 
during the development stage we capitalize certain costs that we incur after site selection but before the receipt of all required permits if we believe that it is probable that the site will be permitted 
residual risks changes in legislative or regulatory requirements may cause changes to the landfill site permitting process 
these changes could make it more difficult and costly to obtain and maintain a landfill permit 
studies performed could be inaccurate  which could result in the denial or revocation of a permit and changes to accounting assumptions 
conditions could exist that were not identified in the study  which may make the location not feasible for a landfill and could result in the denial of a permit 
denial or revocation of a permit could impair the recorded value of the landfill asset 
actions by neighboring parties  private citizen groups or others to oppose our efforts to obtain  maintain or expand permits could result in denial  revocation or suspension of a permit  which could adversely impact the economic viability of the landfill and could impair the recorded value of the landfill 
as a result of opposition to our obtaining a permit  improved technical information as a project progresses  or changes in the anticipated economics associated with a project  we may decide to reduce the scope of or abandon a project  which could result in an asset impairment 
technical landfill design 
upon receipt of initial regulatory approval  technical landfill designs are prepared 
the technical designs  which include the detailed specifications to develop and construct all components of the landfill including the types and quantities of materials that will be required  are reviewed by our environmental management group 
the technical designs are submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval 
upon approval of the technical designs  the regulatory agencies issue permits to develop and operate the landfill 
residual risks changes in legislative or regulatory requirements may require changes in the landfill technical designs 
these changes could make it more difficult and costly to meet new design standards 
technical design requirements  as approved  may need modifications at some future point in time 
technical designs could be inaccurate and could result in increased construction costs  difficulty in obtaining a permit or the use of rates to recognize the amortization of landfill development costs and asset retirement obligations that are not appropriate 

table of contents permitted and probable landfill disposal capacity 
included in the technical designs are factors that determine the ultimate disposal capacity of the landfill 
these factors include the area over which the landfill will be developed  such as the depth of excavation  the height of the landfill elevation and the angle of the side slope construction 
the disposal capacity of the landfill is calculated in cubic yards 
this measurement of volume is then converted to a disposal capacity expressed in tons based on a site specific expected density to be achieved over the remaining operating life of the landfill 
residual risks estimates of future disposal capacity may change as a result of changes in legislative or regulatory design requirements 
the density of waste may vary due to variations in operating conditions  including waste compaction practices  site design  climate and the nature of the waste 
capacity is defined in cubic yards but waste received is measured in tons 
the number of tons per cubic yard varies by type of waste and our rate of compaction 
development costs 
the types of costs that are detailed in the technical design specifications generally include excavation  natural and synthetic liners  construction of leachate collection systems  installation of methane gas collection systems and monitoring probes  installation of groundwater monitoring wells  construction of leachate management facilities and other costs associated with the development of the site 
we review the adequacy of our cost estimates on an annual basis by comparing estimated costs with third party bids or contractual arrangements  reviewing the changes in year over year cost estimates for reasonableness  and comparing our resulting development cost per acre with prior period costs 
these development costs  together with any costs incurred to acquire  design and permit the landfill  including capitalized interest  are recorded to the landfill asset on the balance sheet as incurred 
residual risk actual future costs of construction materials and third party labor could differ from the costs we have estimated because of the availability of the required materials and labor 
technical designs could be altered due to unexpected operating conditions  regulatory changes or legislative changes 
landfill development asset amortization 
in order to match the expense related to the landfill asset with the revenue generated by the landfill operations  we amortize the landfill development asset over its operating life on a per ton basis as waste is accepted at the landfill 
the landfill asset is fully amortized at the end of a landfill s operating life 
the per ton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the landfill development asset net book value plus estimated future development costs as described above for the landfill by the landfill s estimated remaining disposal capacity 
the expected future development costs are not inflated or discounted  but rather expressed in nominal dollars 
this rate is applied to each ton accepted at the landfill to arrive at amortization expense for the period 
amortization rates are influenced by the original cost basis of the landfill  including acquisition costs  which in turn is determined by geographic location and market values 
we secure significant landfill assets through business acquisitions and value them at the time of acquisition based on fair value 
amortization rates are also influenced by site specific engineering and cost factors 
residual risk changes in our future development cost estimates or our disposal capacity will normally result in a change in our amortization rates and will impact amortization expense prospectively 
an unexpected significant increase in estimated costs or reduction in disposal capacity could affect the ongoing economic viability of the landfill and result in asset impairment 

table of contents on at least an annual basis  we update the estimates of future development costs and remaining disposal capacity for each landfill 
these costs and disposal capacity estimates are reviewed and approved by senior operations management annually 
changes in cost estimates and disposal capacity are reflected prospectively in the landfill amortization rates that are updated annually 
landfill asset retirement obligations we have two types of retirement obligations related to landfills capping and closure and post closure 
obligations associated with final capping activities that occur during the operating life of the landfill are recognized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed within each discrete capping event 
obligations related to closure and post closure activities that occur after the landfill has ceased operations are recognized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed throughout the entire life of the landfill 
landfill retirement obligations are capitalized as the related liabilities are recognized and amortized using the units of consumption method over the airspace consumed within the capping event or the airspace consumed within the entire landfill  depending on the nature of the obligation 
all obligations are initially measured at estimated fair value 
fair value is calculated on a present value basis using an inflation rate and our credit adjusted  risk free rate in effect at the time the liabilities were incurred 
future costs for final capping  closure and post closure are developed at least annually by engineers  and are inflated to future value using estimated future payment dates and inflation rate projections 
landfill capping 
as individual areas within each landfill reach capacity  we must cap and close the areas in accordance with the landfill site permit 
these requirements are detailed in the technical design of the landfill site process previously described 
closure and post closure 
closure costs are costs incurred after a landfill stops receiving waste  but prior to being certified as closed 
after the entire landfill has reached capacity and is certified closed  we must to maintain and monitor the site for a post closure period  which generally extends for years 
costs associated with closure and post closure requirements generally include maintenance of the site  the monitoring of methane gas collection systems and groundwater systems  and other activities that occur after the site has ceased accepting waste 
costs associated with post closure monitoring generally include groundwater sampling  analysis and statistical reports  third party labor associated with gas system operations and maintenance  transportation and disposal of leachate  and erosion control costs related to the final cap 
landfill retirement obligation liabilities and assets 
estimates of the total future costs required to cap  close and monitor the landfill as specified by each landfill permit are updated annually 
the estimates include inflation  the specific timing of future cash outflows  and the anticipated waste flow into the capping events 
our cost estimates are inflated to the period of performance using an estimate of inflation  which is updated annually and is based upon the ten year average consumer price index in both and 
the present value of the remaining capping costs for specific capping events and the remaining closure and post closure costs for the landfill are recorded as incurred on a per ton basis 
these liabilities are incurred as disposal capacity is consumed at the landfill 
capping  closure and post closure liabilities are recorded in layers and discounted using our credit adjusted risk free rate in effect at the time the obligation is incurred in and in 
retirement obligations are increased each year to reflect the passage of time by accreting the balance at the weighted average credit adjusted risk free rate that was used to calculate each layer of the recorded liabilities 
this accretion is charged to operating expenses 
actual cash expenditures reduce the asset retirement obligation liabilities as they are made 
corresponding retirement obligation assets are recorded for the same value as the additions to the capping  closure and post closure liabilities 
the retirement obligation assets are amortized to expense on a per ton basis 
table of contents as disposal capacity is consumed 
the per ton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of each of the recorded retirement obligation asset s net book value and expected future additions to the retirement obligation asset by the remaining disposal capacity 
a per ton rate is determined for each separate capping event based on the disposal capacity relating to that event 
closure and post closure per ton rates are based on the total disposal capacity of the landfill 
residual risks changes in legislative or regulatory requirements  including changes in capping  closure activities or post closure monitoring activities  types and quantities of materials used  or term of post closure care  could cause changes in our cost estimates 
changes in the landfill retirement obligation due to changes in the anticipated waste flow  changes in airspace compaction estimates or changes in the timing of expenditures for closed landfills and fully incurred but unpaid capping events are recorded in results of operations prospectively 
this could result in unanticipated increases or decreases in expense 
actual timing of disposal capacity utilization could differ from projected timing  causing differences in timing of when amortization and accretion expense is recognized for capping  closure and post closure liabilities 
changes in inflation rates could impact our actual future costs and our total liabilities 
changes in our capital structure or market conditions could result in changes to the credit adjusted risk free rate used to discount the liabilities  which could cause changes in future recorded liabilities  assets and expense 
amortization rates could change in the future based on the evaluation of new facts and circumstances relating to landfill capping design  post closure monitoring requirements  or the inflation or discount rate 
on an annual basis  we update our estimates of future capping  closure and post closure costs and of future disposal capacity for each landfill 
revisions in estimates of our costs or timing of expenditures are recognized immediately as increases or decreases to the capping  closure and post closure liabilities and the corresponding retirement obligation assets 
changes in the assets result in changes to the amortization rates which are applied prospectively  except for fully incurred capping events and closed landfills  where the changes are recorded immediately in results of operations since the associated disposal capacity has already been consumed 
permitted and probable disposal capacity 
disposal capacity is determined by the specifications detailed in the landfill permit 
we classify this disposal capacity as permitted 
we also include probable expansion disposal capacity in our remaining disposal capacity estimates  thus including additional disposal capacity being sought through means of a permit expansion 
probable expansion disposal capacity has not yet received final approval from the applicable regulatory agencies  but we have determined that certain critical criteria have been met and the successful completion of the expansion is probable 
we have developed six criteria that must be met before an expansion area is designated as probable expansion airspace 
we believe that satisfying all of these criteria demonstrates a high likelihood that expansion airspace that is incorporated in our landfill costing will be permitted 
however  because some of these criteria are judgmental  they may exclude expansion airspace that will eventually be permitted or include expansion airspace that will not be permitted 
in either of these scenarios  our amortization  depletion and accretion expense could change significantly 
our internal criteria to classify disposal capacity as probable expansion airspace are as follows we own the land associated with the expansion airspace or control it pursuant to an option agreement  we are committed to supporting the expansion project financially and with appropriate resources  
table of contents there are no identified fatal flaws or impediments associated with the project  including political impediments  progress is being made on the project  the expansion is attainable within a reasonable time frame  and we believe it is likely we will receive the expansion permit 
after successfully meeting these criteria  the disposal capacity that will result from the planned expansion is included in our remaining disposal capacity estimates 
additionally  for purposes of calculating landfill amortization and capping  closure and post closure rates  we include the incremental costs to develop  construct  close and monitor the related probable expansion disposal capacity 
residual risk we may be unsuccessful in obtaining permits for probable expansion disposal capacity because of the failure to obtain the final local  state or federal permits or due to other unknown reasons 
if we are unsuccessful in obtaining permits for probable expansion disposal capacity  or the disposal capacity for which we obtain approvals is less than what was estimated  both our estimated total costs and disposal capacity will be reduced  which generally increases the rates we charge for landfill amortization and capping  closure and post closure accruals 
an unexpected decrease in disposal capacity could also cause an asset impairment 
environmental liabilities we are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment  and we remediate sites in the ordinary course of our business 
under current laws and regulations  we may be responsible for environmental remediation at sites that we either own or operate  including sites that we have acquired  or sites where we have or a company that we have acquired has delivered waste 
our environmental remediation liabilities primarily include costs associated with remediating groundwater  surface water and soil contamination  as well as controlling and containing methane gas migration and the related legal costs 
to estimate our ultimate liability at these sites  we evaluate several factors  including the nature and extent of contamination at each identified site  the required remediation methods  the apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties and the financial viability of those parties 
we accrue for costs associated with environmental remediation obligations when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with accounting for loss contingencies 
we periodically review the status of all environmental matters and update our estimates of the likelihood of and future expenditures for remediation as necessary 
changes in the liabilities resulting from these reviews are recognized currently in earnings in the period in which the adjustment is known 
adjustments to estimates are reasonably possible in the near term and may result in changes to recorded amounts 
with the exception of those obligations assumed in the acquisition of allied that were recorded at estimated fair value  environmental obligations are recorded on an undiscounted basis 
we have not reduced the liabilities we have recorded for recoveries from other potentially responsible parties or insurance companies 
residual risks we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts of our environmental remediation liabilities 
our estimates of these liabilities require assumptions about future events that are uncertain 
consequently  our estimates could change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of contamination  the required remediation methods  the final apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties identified  the financial viability of those parties  and the actions of governmental agencies or private parties with interests in the matter 

table of contents actual amounts could differ from the estimated liabilities as a result of changes in estimated future litigation costs to pursue the matter to ultimate resolution 
an unanticipated environmental liability that arises could result in a material charge to our consolidated statement of income 
self insurance reserves and related costs our insurance programs for workers compensation  general liability  vehicle liability and employee related health care benefits are effectively self insured 
accruals for self insurance reserves are based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported 
we maintain high deductibles for commercial general liability  automobile liability and workers compensation coverage  ranging from million to million 
residual risks incident rates  including frequency and severity  and other actuarial assumptions could change causing our current and future actuarially determined obligations to change  which would be reflected in our consolidated statement of income in the period in which such adjustment is known 
recorded reserves may not be adequate to cover the future payment of claims 
adjustments  if any  to estimates recorded resulting from ultimate claim payments would be reflected in the consolidated statements of income in the periods in which such adjustments are known 
the settlement costs to discharge our obligations  including legal and health care costs  could increase or decrease causing current estimates of our self insurance reserves to change 
loss contingencies we are subject to various legal proceedings  claims and regulatory matters  the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty 
we determine whether to disclose or accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment of whether the risk of loss is remote  reasonably possible or probable  and whether it can be reasonably estimated 
we analyze our litigation and regulatory matters based on available information to assess the potential liabilities 
management s assessment is developed based on an analysis of possible outcomes under various strategies 
we record and disclose loss contingencies pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance for such matter 
we record losses related to contingencies in cost of operations or selling  general and administrative expenses  depending on the nature of the underlying transaction leading to the loss contingency 
residual risks actual costs may vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons  including differing interpretations of laws  opinions on culpability and assessments of the amount of damages 
loss contingency assumptions involve judgments that are inherently subjective and generally involve matters that are by their nature unpredictable 
if a loss contingency results in an adverse judgment or is settled for a significant amount  it could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position  result of operations or cash flows in the period in which such judgment or settlement occurs 
asset impairment valuation methodology 
we evaluate our long lived assets other than goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable based on projected cash flows anticipated to be generated from the ongoing operation of those assets or we intend to sell or otherwise dispose of the assets 

table of contents residual risk if events or changes in circumstances occur  including reductions in anticipated cash flows generated by our operations or determinations to divest assets  certain assets could be impaired  which would result in a non cash charge to earnings 
evaluation criteria 
we test long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable 
examples of such events could include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use a long lived asset  a change in its physical condition  or new circumstances that could cause an expectation that it is more likely than not that we would sell or otherwise dispose of a long lived asset significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
residual risk our most significant asset impairment exposure  other than goodwill which is discussed below relates to our landfills 
a significant reduction in our estimated disposal capacity as a result of unanticipated events such as regulatory developments  revocation of an existing permit or denial of an expansion permit  or changes in our assumptions used to calculate disposal capacity  could trigger an impairment charge 
recognition criteria 
if such circumstances arise  we recognize impairment for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset if the net book value of the asset exceeds the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
we generally use the present value of the expected cash flows from that asset to determine fair value 
goodwill recoverability we annually test goodwill for impairment at december or when an indicator of impairment exists 
we test goodwill for impairment using the two step process 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
we have defined our reporting units to be consistent with our operating segments eastern  midwestern  southern  and western 
in determining fair value  we primarily use discounted future cash flows and operating results based on a comparative multiple of earnings or revenues 
significant estimates used in our fair value calculation using discounted future cash flows include i estimates of future revenue and expense growth by reporting unit  which we estimate to range from to  ii future estimated effective tax rates  which we estimate to be  iii future estimated capital expenditures as well as future required investments in working capital  iv estimated discount rates  which we estimate to range between and  and v the future terminal value of the reporting unit  which is based on its ability to exist into perpetuity 
significant estimates used in the fair value calculation using market value multiples include i estimated future growth potential of the reporting unit  ii estimated multiples of revenue or earnings a willing buyer is likely to pay  and iii estimated control premium a willing buyer is likely to pay 
in addition  we evaluate a reporting unit for impairment if events or circumstances change between annual tests  indicating a possible impairment 
examples of such events or circumstances include i a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  ii an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  iii a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion thereof will be sold  iv continued or sustained losses at a reporting unit  v a significant decline in our market capitalization as compared to our book value  or vi the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within the reporting unit 
we assign assets and liabilities from our corporate operating segment to our four reporting units to the extent that such assets or liabilities relate to the cash flows of the reporting unit and would be included in determining the reporting unit s fair value 

table of contents in preparing our annual test for impairment as of december   we determined that our indicated fair value of total invested capital exceeded our total market capitalization 
we believe one of the primary reconciling differences between the indicated fair value of total invested capital and our total market capitalization is due to a control premium 
we believe the control premium represents the value a market participant could extract as savings and or synergies by obtaining control  and thereby eliminating duplicative overhead and operating costs resulting from the consolidation of routes and internalization of waste streams 
as of december   we determined that the indicated fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value by a range of to approximately and  therefore  we noted no indicators of impairment at our reporting units 
we will continuously monitor market trends in our business  the related expected cash flows and our calculation of market capitalization for purposes of identifying possible indicators of impairment 
if our book value per share exceeds our market price per share or if we have other indicators of impairment  we will be required to perform an interim step one impairment analysis  which may lead to a step two analysis and possible impairment of our goodwill 
additionally  we would then be required to review our remaining long lived assets for impairment 
our operating segments  which also represent our reporting units  are comprised of several vertically integrated businesses 
when an individual business within an integrated operating segment is divested  goodwill is allocated to that business based on its fair value relative to the fair value of its operating segment 
residual risks future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with acquired businesses is impaired 
the valuation of identifiable goodwill requires significant estimates and judgment about future performance  cash flows and fair value 
our future results could be affected if these current estimates of future performance and fair value change 
for example  a reduction in long term growth assumptions could reduce the estimated fair value of the operating segments to below their carrying values  which could trigger an impairment charge 
similarly  an increase in our discount rate could trigger an impairment charge 
any resulting impairment charge could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets other than non deductible goodwill and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the income tax rate in effect during the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in making this determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
in the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  we will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce our provision for income taxes 
our income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid 
we are subject to us federal income taxes and numerous state jurisdictions 
significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the combined income tax expense 
regarding the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements  we record a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon 
table of contents examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of income 
accrued interest and penalties are included within other accrued liabilities and deferred income taxes and other long term tax liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
residual risks income tax assets and liabilities established in purchase accounting for acquisitions are based on assumptions that could differ from the ultimate outcome of the tax matters 
such adjustments would be charged or credited to earnings  unless they meet certain remeasurement criteria and are allowed to be adjusted to goodwill 
changes in the estimated realizability of deferred tax assets could result in adjustments to our provision for income taxes 
valuation allowances for deferred tax assets and the realizability of net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes are based on our judgment 
if our judgments and estimates concerning valuation allowances and the realizability of net operating loss carryforwards are incorrect  our provision for income taxes would change 
we are currently under examination or administrative review by various state and federal taxing authorities for certain tax years 
the internal revenue code and income tax regulations are a complex set of rules that we must interpret and apply 
positions taken in tax years under examination or subsequent years are subject to challenge 
accordingly  we may have exposure for additional tax liabilities arising from these audits if any positions taken by us or by companies we have acquired are disallowed by the taxing authorities 
we adjust our liabilities for uncertain tax positions when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available 
due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  their ultimate resolution may result in payments that are materially different from our current estimates of the tax liabilities 
these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to our provision for income taxes in the period in which they are determined 
defined benefit pension plans we currently have one qualified defined benefit pension plan  the bfi retirement plan the plan 
the plan covers certain employees in the united states  including some employees subject to collective bargaining agreements 
the plan s benefit formula is based on a percentage of compensation as defined in the plan document 
the benefits of approximately of the current plan participants were frozen upon allied s acquisition of bfi in our pension contributions are made in accordance with funding standards established by the employee retirement income security act of and the internal revenue code  as amended by the pension protection act of the plan s assets are invested as determined by our retirement benefits committee 
at december   the plan assets were invested in fixed income bond funds  equity funds and cash 
we annually review and adjust the plan s asset allocation as deemed necessary 
our unfunded benefit obligation for the plan was million as of december  compared to million as of december  residual risk changes in the plan s investment mix and performance of the equity and bond markets and fund managers could impact the amount of pension income or expense recorded  the funded status of the plan and the need for future cash contributions 

table of contents assumptions 
the benefit obligation and associated income or expense related to the plan are determined based on assumptions concerning items such as discount rates  expected rates of return and average rates of compensation increases 
our assumptions are reviewed annually and adjusted as deemed necessary 
we determine the discount rate based on a model which matches the timing and amount of expected benefit payments to maturities of high quality bonds priced as of the plan measurement date 
where that timing does not correspond to a published high quality bond rate  our model uses an expected yield curve to determine an appropriate current discount rate 
the yield on the bonds is used to derive a discount rate for the liability 
if the discount rate were to increase by  our benefit obligation would decrease by approximately million 
if the discount rate were to decrease by  our benefit obligation would increase by approximately million 
in developing our expected rate of return assumption  we evaluate long term expected and historical returns on the plan assets  giving consideration to our asset mix and the anticipated duration of the plan obligations 
the average rate of compensation increase reflects our expectations of average pay increases over the periods benefits are earned 
less than of participants in the plan continue to earn service benefits 
residual risks our assumed discount rate is sensitive to changes in market based interest rates 
a decrease in the discount rate will increase our related benefit plan obligation 
our annual pension expense would be impacted if the actual return on plan assets were to vary from the expected return 
new accounting standards for a description of new accounting standards that may affect us  see note  summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements in item of this form k

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our major market risk exposure of our financial instruments is changing interest rates in the united states and fluctuations in libor 
we intend to manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt 
the carrying value of our variable rate debt approximates fair value because interest rates are variable and  accordingly  approximates current market rates for instruments with similar risk and maturities 
the fair value of our debt is determined as of the balance sheet date and is subject to change 
the table below provides information about certain of our market sensitive financial instruments and constitutes a forward looking statement 
expected maturity date thereafter total fair value of asset liability as of december  fixed rate debt amount outstanding in millions average interest rates variable rate debt amount outstanding in millions average interest rates 
table of contents the fixed and variable rate debt amounts above exclude the remaining non cash discounts  premiums and adjustments to fair value recorded in purchase accounting totaling million 
fuel price risk fuel costs represent a significant operating expense 
when economically practical  we may enter into new or renew contracts  or engage in other strategies to mitigate market risk 
where appropriate  we have implemented a fuel recovery fee that is designed to recover our fuel costs 
while we charge these fees to a majority of our customers  we are unable to charge such fees to all customers 
consequently  an increase in fuel costs results in an increase in our cost of operations  a smaller increase in our revenue from the fuel recovery fee and a decrease in our operating margin percentage  because the increase in revenue is more than offset by the increase in cost 
conversely  a decrease in fuel costs results in a decrease in our cost of operations  a smaller decrease in our revenue and an increase in our operating margin percentage 
at our current consumption levels  a one cent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel costs by approximately million on an annual basis  which would be partially offset by a smaller change in the fuel recovery fees charged to our customers 
accordingly  a substantial rise or drop in fuel costs could result in a material impact to our revenue and cost of operations 
our operations also require the use of certain petrochemical based products such as liners at our landfills whose costs may vary with the price of petrochemicals 
an increase in the price of petrochemicals could increase the cost of those products  which would increase our operating and capital costs 
we also are susceptible to increases in indirect fuel recovery fees from our vendors 
commodities prices we market recycled products such as cardboard and newspaper from our materials recovery facilities 
market demand for recyclable materials causes volatility in commodity prices 
at current volumes and mix of materials  we believe a ten dollar per ton change in the price of recyclable materials will change revenue and operating income by approximately million and million  respectively  on an annual basis 
revenue from sales of these products in  and was approximately million  million and million  respectively
