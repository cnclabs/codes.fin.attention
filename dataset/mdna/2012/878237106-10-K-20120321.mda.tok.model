risk factors in this annual report on form k for the year ended january  for further information 
we undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include the following global economic and political instability competition narrow margins dependence on information systems acquisitions and divestitures exposure to natural disasters  war and terrorism dependence on independent shipping companies impact of policy changes labor strikes risk of declines in inventory value product availability vendor terms and conditions loss of significant customers customer credit exposure need for liquidity and capital resources  fluctuations in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates  exposure to foreign markets international operations changes in income tax and other regulatory legislation potential adverse effects of litigation or regulatory enforcement actions changes in accounting rules volatility of common stock price overview tech data is one of the world s largest wholesale distributors of technology products 
we serve as an indispensable link in the technology supply chain by bringing products from the world s leading technology vendors to market  as well as providing our customers with advanced logistics capabilities and value added services 
our customers include value added resellers vars direct marketers  retailers and corporate resellers who support the diverse technology needs of end users 
we manage our business in two geographic segments the americas including north america and south america and europe 
the company s financial objectives are to grow sales at or above the market rate of growth for technology products  gain share in select markets  improve profitability  generate positive cash flow  and earn a return on invested capital above our weighted average cost of capital 
to achieve this  we are focused on a strategy of execution  diversification and innovation that we believe differentiates our business in the marketplace 

table of contents the fundamental element of our strategy is superior execution 
our execution strategy is supported by our highly efficient logistics infrastructure  combined with our multiple service offerings  to generate demand  develop markets and provide supply chain services for our vendors and customers 
the technology distribution industry in which we operate is characterized by narrow gross profit as a percentage of sales gross margin and narrow income from operations as a percentage of sales operating margin 
historically  our gross and operating margins have been impacted by intense price competition and declining average selling prices per unit  as well as changes in terms and conditions with our vendors  including those terms related to rebates  price protection  product returns and other incentives 
we expect these conditions to continue in the foreseeable future and  therefore  we will continue to proactively evaluate our pricing policies and inventory management practices in response to potential changes in our vendor terms and conditions and the general market environment 
from a balance sheet perspective  we require working capital primarily to finance accounts receivable and inventory 
we have historically relied upon debt  trade credit from our vendors  and accounts receivable financing programs for our working capital needs 
at january   we had a debt to capital ratio calculated as total debt divided by the aggregate of total debt and total equity of in addition to driving superior execution  we continue to diversify and realign our customer and product portfolios to improve long term profitability throughout our operations 
our broadline distribution business  characterized as high volume  more commoditized offerings  and comprised primarily of personal computer systems  peripherals  supplies and other similar products  continues to be the foundation of our business and represents a significant percentage of our revenue 
however  as technology advances  we have continued to evolve our business model  product mix  and value added offerings in order to provide our vendors with the most efficient distribution channel for their products  and our customers with a broad array of innovative solutions to sell 
we have responded to a changing it landscape with investments in higher growth specialty areas  namely  the data center  software  consumer electronics and mobility  all of which now contribute significantly to our financial results 
our investments in our european mobility joint venture with brightstar corp 
brightstar  which began in  generated revenues of approximately billion during fiscal the most recent examples of such investments are acquisitions made in europe during the second half of fiscal in october  we acquired the distribution business of mensch und maschine software se  a leading value added distributor in the design software market in several european countries for a purchase price of million  including deferred payments and earnouts  based on the foreign currency exchange rates on the date of acquisition 
in december  we acquired an additional value added specialty software distributor in belgium 
these acquisitions  while not material to our consolidated financial results  strengthen our position as autodesk  inc s leading value added distributor by establishing a presence in benelux and romania  extend our product portfolio to include the autodesk  inc software for the manufacturing industry in italy  france  uk and poland  and add a number of highly skilled and qualified professionals to our team across europe 
in addition  in april  we executed an agreement with brightstar to establish a us joint venture to capitalize on the mobility market serving small and medium size businesses smb 
the joint venture will assist our reseller customers in providing smb end users with a wide array of products and services including wireless activation and renewal processes  data services  software  hardware  technical support and billing management 
finally  another strategic area of investment for us is our integrated supply chain services designed to provide innovative third party logistics and other offerings to our business partners 
our evolving mix of products  services  customers and geographies have played a key role in delivering balanced and improved operating results  and are important factors in achieving our strategic financial goals 
as we execute our diversification strategy we continuously monitor the extension of credit and other terms and conditions offered to our customers to prudently balance risk  profitability and return on invested capital 
the final tenet of our strategy is innovation 
our it systems and e business tools and programs have provided our business with the flexibility to effectively navigate fluctuations in market conditions  structural changes in the technology industry  as well as changes created by products we sell 
one of our most recent and significant innovations is our streamone solutions store 
the streamone solutions store provides independent software vendors and cloud providers with a platform to market software as a service and other offerings to more than  of our resellers in the united states  thereby establishing a previously unavailable route to market for these independent software vendors and cloud providers 
another example of our investment in innovation and one that we believe is providing us with the flexibility to meet the demands of the ever evolving technology market  is our continued deployment of internal it systems across both the americas and europe 
we believe our pan european it systems provide us with a competitive advantage allowing us to drive efficiencies throughout our business while delivering innovative solutions for our business partners 
in the past  we have implemented several components of our european it systems into our north american it infrastructure  including standardizing our north america financial systems and logistics network on sap 
in fiscal  we will continue to deploy core applications currently operating our european business into our americas region and continue to invest in our it infrastructure in europe 
while we have had numerous successful it system implementations in both europe and in north america to date  we can make no assurances that we will not have disruptions  delays and or negative operational impacts from these ongoing implementations 
we believe our strategy of execution  diversification and innovation is differentiating us in the markets we serve and is delivering solid sales growth  select market share gains  higher earnings per share  strong operating cash flow  and industry leading returns on invested capital 
we are constantly monitoring the factors that we can control  including our net sales growth  management of costs  
table of contents working capital and capital spending 
we also continuously evaluate the current and potential profitability and return on our investments in all geographies and consider changes in current and future investments based on risks  opportunities and current and anticipated market conditions 
in connection with these evaluations  we may incur additional costs to the extent we decide to increase or decrease our investments in certain geographies 
we will also continue to evaluate targeted strategic investments across our operations and new business opportunities 
for example  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  in response to current and anticipated market conditions  we realigned our personnel resources in europe  reducing personnel in certain lower growth  lower margin markets and increasing personnel in those markets providing the greatest opportunity for profitability and shareholder returns  resulting in an incremental year over year increase of million in severance costs during the quarter  and a net reduction of our personnel in europe 
we will continue to invest in those markets and product segments we believe provide us with the greatest opportunities for profitable growth 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of fiscal as part of our ongoing initiatives to optimize profitability and return on invested capital  we closed our in country commercial operations in brazil and colombia 
both of these operations failed to meet our goals for profitability and return on investment 
as a result of these closures  we incurred total cash and non cash charges of million during the fourth quarter of fiscal these costs do not include any estimated costs associated with the brazilian subsidiary s contingencies related to cide and other non income related tax examinations previously disclosed 
we will maintain a legal entity in brazil to address our future fiscal and legal responsibilities 
we will continue to serve both of these markets through our miami based export business 
critical accounting policies and estimates the information included within md a is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventory  vendor incentives  goodwill and intangible assets  deferred taxes  and contingencies 
our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information  historical results  and other assumptions we believe are reasonable 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the critical accounting policies discussed below affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in estimating the required allowance  we take into consideration the overall quality and aging of the receivable portfolio  the existence of credit insurance and specifically identified customer risks 
also influencing our estimates are the following the large number of customers and their dispersion across wide geographic areas  the fact that no single customer accounts for more than of our net sales  the value and adequacy of collateral received from customers  if any  our historical loss experience  and the current economic environment 
if actual customer performance were to deteriorate to an extent not expected by us  additional allowances may be required which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial results 
conversely  if actual customer performance were to improve to an extent not expected by us  a reduction in allowances may be required which could have a favorable effect on our consolidated financial results 
inventory we value our inventory at the lower of its cost or market value  with cost being determined on the first in  first out method 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon an aging analysis of the inventory on hand  specifically known inventory related risks such as technological obsolescence and the nature of vendor terms surrounding price protection and product returns  foreign currency fluctuations for foreign sourced product  and assumptions about future demand 
market conditions or changes in terms and conditions by our vendors that are less favorable than those projected by management may require additional inventory write downs  which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial results 
vendor incentives we receive incentives from vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances  infrastructure funding  volume rebates and other incentive agreements 
these incentives are generally under quarterly  semi annual or annual agreements with the vendors  however  some of these incentives are negotiated on an ad hoc basis to support specific programs mutually developed with the vendor 
unrestricted volume rebates and early payment discounts received from vendors are recorded when they are earned as a reduction of inventory and as a reduction of cost of products sold as the related inventory is sold 
vendor incentives for specifically identified cooperative advertising programs and infrastructure funding are recorded when earned as adjustments to product costs or selling  general and administrative expenses  depending on the nature of the programs 

table of contents we also provide reserves for receivables on vendor programs for estimated losses resulting from vendors inability to pay or rejections by vendors of claims 
should amounts recorded as outstanding receivables from vendors be deemed uncollectible  additional allowances may be required which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial results 
goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets the carrying value of goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment and may also be reviewed more frequently if current events and circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
an impairment loss  if any  is charged to expense in the period identified 
the company performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of january  and determined there was no impairment 
we also examine the carrying value of our intangible assets with finite lives  which includes capitalized software and development costs  purchased intangibles  and other long lived assets as current events and circumstances warrant determining whether there are any impairment losses 
if indicators of impairment are present and future cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the assets carrying amount  an impairment loss is charged to expense in the period identified 
factors that may cause a goodwill  intangible asset or other long lived asset impairment include negative industry or economic trends and significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results 
our valuation methodologies include  but are not limited to  a discounted cash flow model  which estimates the net present value of the projected cash flows of our reporting units and a market approach  which evaluates comparative market multiples applied to our reporting units businesses to yield a second assumed value of each reporting unit 
if actual results are substantially lower than our projections underlying these assumptions  or if market discount rates substantially increase  our future valuations could be adversely affected  potentially resulting in future impairment charges 
income taxes we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
in assessing the adequacy of a recorded valuation allowance  we consider all positive and negative evidence and a variety of factors including the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  historical and projected future taxable income  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
if we determine it is more likely than not that we will be able to use a deferred tax asset in the future in excess of its net carrying value  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be made to reduce income tax expense  thereby increasing net income in the period such determination was made 
should we determine that we are not likely to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be made to income tax expense  thereby reducing net income in the period such determination was made 
contingencies we accrue for contingent obligations  including estimated legal costs  when the obligation is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable 
as facts concerning contingencies become known  we reassess our position and make appropriate adjustments to the financial statements 
estimates that are particularly sensitive to future changes include those related to tax  legal  and other regulatory matters such as imports and exports  the imposition of international governmental controls  changes in the interpretation and enforcement of international laws in particular related to items such as duty and taxation  and the impact of local economic conditions and practices  which are all subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation process 
recent accounting pronouncements and legislation see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for the discussion on recent accounting pronouncements 
results of operations we do not consider stock based compensation expense in assessing the performance of our operating segments  and therefore the company reports stock based compensation expense separately 
the following table summarizes our net sales  change in net sales  operating income and non gaap operating income by geographic region for the fiscal years ended january   and of net sales of net sales of net sales net sales by geographic region in thousands americas europe total

we sell many products purchased from the world s leading systems  peripherals  networking and software vendors 
products purchased from hewlett packard company generated  and of our net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
there were no other vendors that accounted for or more of our net sales in the past three fiscal years

table of contents net sales our consolidated net sales were billion in fiscal  an increase of when compared to fiscal the strengthening of certain foreign currencies against the us dollar positively impacted the year over year net sales comparison by approximately three percentage points 
on a regional basis  during fiscal  net sales in the americas increased by compared to fiscal and increased by in europe an increase of on a euro basis 
throughout fiscal  we were impacted by an overall slowing of the it market and a challenging macro economic environment within certain european countries 
despite these factors  net sales in both the americas and europe regions increased during fiscal compared to fiscal primarily as a result of the flexibility of our business model to successfully navigate the changing it market 
the increase in net sales in the americas during fiscal was primarily attributable to a generally stable demand for technology products in the region in comparison to the prior fiscal year  offset by the impact of lower sales in brazil and colombia during fiscal as a result of our decision to close both of these operations 
the reduction in net sales in brazil and colombia negatively impacted the americas growth rate in fiscal by approximately one percentage point 
the increase in net sales in europe on a euro basis during fiscal was primarily attributable to our acquisitions of triade holding bv s triade mobility  consumer electronics and it distribution businesses in october and continued demand in the european commercial sector and for mobility products in the region compared to the prior fiscal year 
while difficult to quantify due to the integration of the acquisitions into our operations  we believe the fiscal mobility and consumer electronics acquisitions contributed approximately four percentage points to our european growth rates  on a euro basis 
during fiscal  we experienced lower european demand for it products in certain geographies resulting from weak economies in countries such as spain and portugal 
this lower demand  however  was largely offset by strong sales performance in other european markets  such as germany  uk  france and the netherlands 
our consolidated net sales were billion in fiscal  an increase of when compared to fiscal the weakening of certain foreign currencies against the us dollar negatively impacted the year over year net sales comparison by approximately three percentage points 
on a regional basis  during fiscal  net sales in the americas increased by compared to fiscal and increased by in europe an increase of on a euro basis 
the increase in net sales in both the americas and europe during fiscal was attributable to the robust demand environment in both regions brought about by a recovery in it spending throughout the fiscal year and  to a lesser extent  the impact of our five acquisitions in europe 
gross profit gross profit as a percentage of net sales gross margin during fiscal both and was and was in fiscal the relative stability in our year over year gross margin is indicative of our product diversification efforts  disciplined approach to managing our customer and vendor portfolios and effective execution of our pricing management practices 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a as a percentage of net sales increased to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the relative stability of our sg a as a percentage of net sales during fiscal compared to the prior year is primarily the result of increased costs incurred related to acquisitions and to support our sales growth and diversification strategies being largely offset by operating leverage on the increase in net sales and cost savings initiatives during both fiscal and in absolute dollars  sg a increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in sg a during fiscal is primarily attributable to the impact of the acquisition of triade s mobility and consumer electronics businesses in the third quarter of fiscal  the strengthening of certain foreign currencies against the us dollar  increased costs incurred to support our sales growth and diversification strategies  and increased severance costs in europe resulting from a realignment of resources in the region during the fourth quarter of fiscal sg a as a percentage of net sales declined to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the decrease in sg a as a percentage of sales was primarily attributable to the operating leverage achieved as our net sales increased at a more rapid rate than our operating expenses 
in absolute dollars  sg a increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in sg a during fiscal was primarily attributable to continued investments to support sales growth and strategic initiatives and operating expenses related to acquisitions made during fiscal  partially offset by the impact of weaker foreign currencies 
loss on disposal of subsidiaries we incurred losses on disposal of subsidiaries of million during fiscal as a result of closing the company s in country commercial operations in brazil and colombia 
the loss on disposal of these subsidiaries includes a million impairment charge on the company s investments in brazil and colombia due to a foreign currency exchange loss previously recorded in shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income  million related to the write off of certain value added tax receivables  and million comprised primarily of severance costs  fixed asset write offs and lease termination penalties 
these costs do not include any 
table of contents estimated costs associated with the brazilian subsidiary s contingencies related to cide and other non income related tax examinations 
the operating losses of brazil and colombia for the fiscal year ended january   were not significant to the company s consolidated operating results see note and note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
interest expense interest expense increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in interest expense in fiscal is primarily attributable to an increase in the average outstanding revolving credit loan balances as compared to fiscal interest expense increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in interest expense in fiscal is primarily attributable to an increase in the average outstanding revolving credit loan balances as compared to fiscal during the fiscal years  and  interest expense includes non cash interest expense of million  million and million  respectively  related to the million convertible senior debentures see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
other expense income  net other expense income  net  consists primarily of interest income  discounts on the sale of accounts receivable and net foreign currency exchange gains losses on certain financing transactions and the related derivative instruments used to hedge such financing transactions 
other expense income  net  approximated million of net expense in fiscal compared to million of net expense in fiscal the change in other expense income  net  during fiscal is primarily attributable to an increase in foreign currency exchange losses on derivative instruments used to hedge certain financing transactions and an increase in the discount expense on the sale of accounts receivable compared to the prior year  partially offset by an increase in interest income resulting from an increase in the average short term cash investment balances in europe 
other expense income  net  approximated million of net expense in fiscal compared to million of income in fiscal the change in other expense income  net  during fiscal is primarily attributable to a decrease in interest income  resulting from a decrease in the average short term cash investment balances  and greater discount expense on the sale of accounts receivable compared to the prior year 
discount on sale of accounts receivable totaled million and million  respectively in fiscal and there was no discount on sale of accounts receivable for fiscal as we did not sell accounts receivable during the fiscal year 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate was in fiscal and in fiscal the change in the effective tax rate during fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to the relative mix of earnings and losses within the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate and changes in the amounts of income tax reserves and valuation allowances during the respective periods 
in fiscal  we recorded an income tax benefit of million for the reversal of deferred income tax valuation allowances primarily related to specific jurisdictions in europe  which had been recorded in prior fiscal years 
this income tax benefit was substantially offset by an income tax expense associated with the write off of deferred and other income tax assets related to the closure of our brazil in country operations 
on an absolute dollar basis  the provision for income taxes decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the change in the provision for income taxes is primarily due to the relative mix of earnings and losses within certain countries in which we operate and the adjustments to income tax reserves and valuation allowances discussed above 
our effective tax rate was in fiscal and in fiscal the change in the effective tax rate during fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to the relative mix of earnings and losses within the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate and changes in the amounts of income tax reserves and valuation allowances during the respective periods 
in fiscal  we reversed a million deferred tax valuation allowance in a specific european jurisdiction and recorded the amount as an income tax benefit 
on an absolute dollar basis  the provision for income taxes increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the change in the provision for income taxes is primarily due to higher taxable income  the relative mix of earnings and losses within certain countries in which we operate and the adjustments to income tax reserves and valuation allowances discussed above 
to the extent we generate future consistent taxable income within those operations currently requiring valuation allowances  the valuation allowances on the related deferred tax assets will be reduced  thereby reducing tax expense and increasing net income in the same period 
the underlying net operating loss carryforwards remain available to offset future taxable income in the specific jurisdictions requiring the valuation allowance  subject to applicable tax laws and regulations 

table of contents the effective tax rate differed from the us federal statutory rate of during fiscal  and  due to the relative mix of earnings or losses within the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and other adjustments  including i losses in tax jurisdictions where we are not able to record a tax benefit  ii earnings in tax jurisdictions where we have previously recorded valuation allowances  on deferred tax assets  iii the reversal of income tax reserves  iv the write off of deferred tax assets  and v earnings in lower tax jurisdictions for which no us taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states 
the overall effective tax rate will continue to be dependent upon the geographic distribution of our earnings or losses and changes in tax laws or interpretations of these laws in these operating jurisdictions 
we monitor the assumptions used in estimating the annual effective tax rate and make adjustments  if required  throughout the year 
if actual results differ from the assumptions used in estimating our annual income tax rates  future income tax expense could be materially affected 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by lower earnings than anticipated in countries with lower statutory rates  changes in the relative mix of taxable income and taxable loss jurisdictions  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof 
in addition  our income tax returns are subject to continuous examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of such accruals  our effective tax rate could be materially affected 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interest net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was million  million and million  respectively  in fiscal  and the net income attributable to noncontrolling interest represents brightstar s share of the improving results of brightstar europe limited  a joint venture between tech data and brightstar as the joint venture is a consolidated subsidiary in our financial statements 
the year over year changes can be attributed to both the improving results in the joint venture s operations and the acquisition of triade s mobility subsidiaries in belgium and the netherlands mcc during the third quarter of fiscal impact of inflation during the fiscal years ended january   and  we do not believe that inflation had a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or on our financial position 
quarterly data seasonality our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and will likely continue to do so in the future as a result of currency fluctuations and seasonal variations in the demand for the products and services we offer 
narrow operating margins may magnify the impact of these factors on our operating results 
recent historical seasonal variations have included an increase in european demand during our fiscal fourth quarter and decreased demand in other fiscal quarters  particularly quarters that include summer months 
given that the majority of our net sales are derived from europe  our consolidated results closely follow the seasonality trends in europe 
additionally  the life cycles of major products  as well as the impact of future acquisitions and divestitures  may also materially impact our business  financial condition  or results of operations see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our quarterly results 
liquidity and capital resources our discussion of liquidity and capital resources includes an analysis of our cash flows and capital structure for all periods presented 
cash flows the following table summarizes tech data s consolidated statement of cash flows for the fiscal years ended january   and years ended january  in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities 
table of contents years ended january  in thousands effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents as a distribution company  our business requires significant investment in working capital  particularly accounts receivable and inventory  partially financed through our accounts payable to vendors 
overall  as our sales volume increases  our net investment in working capital typically increases  which  in general  results in decreased cash flow from operating activities 
conversely  when sales volume decreases  our net investment in working capital typically decreases  which  in general  results in increased cash flow from operating activities 
another important driver of our operating cash flows is our cash conversion cycle also referred to as net cash days 
our net cash days are defined as days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable dso plus days of supply on hand in inventory dos  less days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable dpo 
we manage our cash conversion cycle on a daily basis throughout the year and our reported financial results reflect that cash conversion cycle at the balance sheet date 
our net cash days were days at the end of fiscal  which was a decrease from fiscal of four days 
the following table presents the components of our cash conversion cycle  in days  as of january   and as of january  days of sales outstanding days of supply in inventory days of purchases outstanding cash conversion cycle days historically  we have presented certain book overdrafts  representing checks issued and wire transfers that have been initiated which have not been presented for payment to the banks  as accounts payable 
based on agreements with our banks in certain countries  we have determined that a significant portion of these book overdrafts are covered by rights of setoff in favor of the respective banks and therefore  we have classified these amounts as a reduction of cash and accounts payable as of january  we have adjusted the financial statements for the years ended january  and to reflect the right of setoff 
the impact of this adjustment on prior periods was to decrease cash and accounts payable as of january  by million and to increase cash flows from operating activities by million for the year ended january   and to decrease cash flows from operating activities by million for the year ended january  this change had the effect of reducing days of purchases outstanding by approximately one day in both fiscal and the impact of this adjustment on prior quarters in fiscal was to decrease cash and accounts payable as of october  july  and april  by million  million and million  respectively  and to increase cash flows from operating activities by million for the year to date period ended october  and to decrease cash flows from operating activities by million and million for the year to date periods ended july  and april   respectively 
management concluded that these adjustments are immaterial to the consolidated financial statements 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal compared to million of cash provided by operating activities in fiscal the increase in cash resulting from operating activities in fiscal compared to the same period of the prior year can be attributed to i a significant reduction in our inventories levels  and ii the timing of both cash receipts from our customers and payments to our vendors 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal compared to million of cash provided by operating activities in fiscal the change in cash resulting from operating activities in fiscal compared to the same period of the prior year can be attributed to i the timing of both cash receipts from our customers and payments to our vendors  and ii additional working capital requirements due to the stronger net sales performance in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of a recovery in it spending throughout fiscal net cash used in investing activities of million during fiscal is the result of million of cash used for acquisitions in europe and million of expenditures for the continuing expansion and upgrading of our it systems  office facilities and equipment for our logistics centers in both the americas and europe 
we expect to make total capital expenditures of approximately million during fiscal for equipment and machinery in our logistics centers  office facilities and it systems 
net cash used in investing activities of million during fiscal is the net result of million of cash used for acquisitions in europe and million of expenditures for the continuing expansion and upgrading of our it systems  office facilities and equipment for our logistics centers in both the americas and europe 

table of contents net cash used in financing activities of million during fiscal is primarily the result of million of cash used in the repurchase of  shares of our common stock under our share repurchase programs  million of net repayments on our revolving credit lines and the million repayment of our convertible senior debentures  partially offset by million of proceeds received from the reissuance of treasury stock related to the vesting and exercise of equity based incentive awards and purchases made through our employee stock purchase plan espp 
net cash used in financing activities of million during fiscal is primarily the result of million of cash used in the repurchase of  shares of our common stock under our share repurchase programs and million of net repayments on the revolving credit lines and long term debt  partially offset by million of net borrowings and a capital contribution from our joint venture partner related to our consolidated joint venture 
capital resources and debt compliance we have maintained a conservative capital structure and have a debt to capital ratio of at january  we believe this conservative approach to our capital structure will continue to support us in a global economic environment that remains uncertain 
within our capital structure  we have a range of financing facilities  which are diversified by type and geographic region with various financial institutions worldwide 
a significant portion of our cash and cash equivalents balance generally resides in our operations outside of the united states and are deposited and or invested with various financial institutions globally which we monitor regularly for credit quality 
however  we are exposed to risk of loss on funds deposited with the various financial institutions and we may experience significant disruptions in our liquidity needs if one or more of these financial institutions were to declare bankruptcy or other similar restructuring 
we believe that our existing sources of liquidity  including cash resources and cash provided by operating activities  supplemented as necessary with funds available under our credit arrangements  will provide sufficient resources to meet our working capital and cash requirements for at least the next months 
changes in our credit rating or other market factors may increase our interest expense or other costs of capital or capital may no longer be available to us on acceptable terms to fund our working capital needs 
the inability to obtain sufficient capital could have an adverse effect on the company s business 
the company s credit facilities contain various financial and other covenants that may limit the company s ability to borrow or limit the company s flexibility in responding to business conditions 
the following is a detailed discussion of our various financing facilities 
convertible senior debentures in december  we issued million of convertible senior debentures due in accordance with the terms of the debentures  in november  we announced our election to fully redeem the debentures on december   at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the debentures plus any accrued and unpaid interest to  but excluding  the redemption date 
as of january   all of the debentures had either been redeemed by us or put to us and there were no debentures outstanding 
we funded the repayment of the debentures with available cash and our million credit agreement  discussed below 
loans payable to brightstar corp 
as of january   we have two loans payable to our joint venture partner  brightstar 
the first loan was executed in october  when brightstar entered into an agreement to loan bel its share of the funding requirements related to bel s acquisition of mcc the acquisition loan see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the outstanding balance of the acquisition loan from brightstar  plus any accrued interest  has a repayment date of september  or earlier if agreed between the two parties  and bears interest at the applicable libor rate plus per year  which is payable annually on october the acquisition loan at january  totaled million 
the second loan is an interest free revolving credit loan 
table of contents issued in connection with bel s operations the brightstar revolver 
the terms of the brightstar revolver contain no contractual repayment date and allow the revolving credit loan to increase or decrease in accordance with the working capital requirements of bel  as determined by the company 
the amount outstanding under the brightstar revolver at january  totaled million 
effective october  a resolution of bel s board was approved stating that the brightstar revolver will not be repaid for the foreseeable future and therefore this revolving credit loan has been classified as long term debt in our consolidated balance sheet at both january  and other credit facilities in september  we entered into a million credit agreement with a syndicate of banks the credit agreement  which replaced our million multi currency revolving credit facility scheduled to expire in march the credit agreement  among other things  i provides for a maturity date of september   ii provides for an interest rate on borrowings  facility fees and letter of credit fees based on our non credit enhanced senior unsecured debt rating as determined by standard poor s rating service and moody s investor service  and iii may be increased up to million  subject to certain conditions 
the credit agreement includes various covenants  limitations and events of default customary for similar facilities for similarly rated borrowers  including a maximum debt to capitalization ratio and minimum interest coverage 
we have also provided a guarantee of certain of our significant subsidiaries 
the credit agreement expires in september and we pay interest on advances under the credit agreement at the applicable libor rate plus a predetermined margin that is based on our debt rating 
there are no amounts outstanding under either of these facilities at either january  or  respectively 
as of january   we maintained a receivables securitization program with a syndicate of banks which allows us to transfer an undivided interest in a designated pool of us accounts receivable  on an ongoing basis  to provide security or collateral for borrowings up to a maximum of million 
this program was renewed in august and amended in december the program will expire in december and interest is to be paid on the receivables securitization program at the applicable commercial paper or libor rate plus an agreed upon margin 
there were no amounts outstanding under the receivables securitization program at january  or in addition to the facilities described above  we have various other committed and uncommitted lines of credit and overdraft facilities totaling approximately million at january  to support our operations 
in consideration of the financial covenants discussed below  our maximum borrowing availability on the credit facilities is approximately billion  of which million was outstanding at january  our credit facilities contain limitations on the amounts of annual dividends and repurchases of common stock 
additionally  the credit facilities require compliance with certain warranties and covenants 
the financial ratio covenants contained within the credit facilities include a debt to capitalization ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio 
at january   the company was in compliance with all such covenants 
the ability to draw funds under these credit facilities is dependent upon sufficient collateral in the case of the receivables securitization program and meeting the aforementioned financial covenants  which may limit the company s ability to draw the full amount of these facilities 
at january   we had also issued standby letters of credit of million 
these letters of credit typically act as a guarantee of payment to certain third parties in accordance with specified terms and conditions 
the issuance of these letters of credit reduces our available capacity under the above mentioned facilities by the same amount 
in september  we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for the issuance of debt securities 
the net proceeds from any issuance of debt securities are expected to be used for general corporate purposes  including the repayment or refinancing of debt  capital expenditures and to meet working capital needs 
as of january   we had not issued any debt securities under this shelf registration statement  nor can any assurances be given that we will issue any debt securities under this registration in the future 
share repurchase programs during fiscal  the company s board of directors authorized share repurchase programs for the repurchase of up to a total of million of the company s common stock 
throughout fiscal  the company s share repurchases were made on the open market through block trades or otherwise 
the number of shares purchased and the timing of the purchases were based on regulatory requirements  working capital requirements  general business conditions and other factors  including alternative investment opportunities 
shares repurchased by the company are held in treasury for general corporate purposes  including issuances under equity incentive plans and our espp 
during fiscal  we repurchased  shares at an average of per share  for a total cost  including expenses  of million under these programs 
in conjunction with the share repurchase programs discussed above  we executed b plans that instruct the broker selected by us to repurchase shares on behalf of the company 
the amount of common stock repurchased in accordance with the b plans on any given trading day is determined by a formula in the plan  which is based on the market price of the company s common stock 
shares repurchased by the company are held in treasury for general corporate purposes  including issuances under equity incentive plans and our espp 

table of contents contractual obligations as of january   future payments of debt and amounts due under future minimum lease payments  including minimum commitments under it outsourcing agreements  are as follows in thousands operating leases capital lease debt total fiscal year thereafter total payments less amounts representing interest total principal payments amounts include all debt outstanding at january  under the company s committed and uncommitted revolving credit facilities and loan payable and revolving credit loan payable to brightstar and excludes estimated interest as the revolving credit facilities and loans payable are at variable rates of interest or interest free 
fair value renewal and escalation clauses exist for a substantial portion of the operating leases included above 
purchase orders for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders typically represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on the company and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current demand expectations and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we do not have significant non cancelable agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for the next three months 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however  the obligations under these contracts were not significant  other than the it outsourcing agreement included above  and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
at january   we have million recorded as a current liability for uncertain tax positions 
we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of long term payments  or the amount by which our liability will increase or decrease over time  therefore  the long term portion of our liability for uncertain tax position has not been included in the contractual obligations table above and is not material to our consolidated financial statements see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements synthetic lease facility we have a synthetic lease facility the synthetic lease with a group of financial institutions under which we lease certain logistics centers and office facilities from a third party lessor 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company renewed its existing synthetic lease with a new agreement that expires in june properties leased under the synthetic lease are located in clearwater and miami  florida  fort worth  texas  fontana  california  suwanee  georgia  swedesboro  new jersey  and south bend  indiana 
the synthetic lease has been accounted for as an operating lease and rental payments are calculated at the applicable libor rate plus a margin based on our credit ratings 
during the first four years of the lease term  we may  at our option  purchase any combination of the seven properties  at an amount equal to each of the property s cost  as long as the lease balance does not decrease below a defined amount 
during the last year of the lease term  until days prior to the lease expiration  we may  at our option  i purchase a minimum of two of the seven properties  at an amount equal to each of the property s cost  ii exercise the option to renew the lease for a minimum of two of the seven properties or iii exercise the option to remarket a minimum of two of the seven properties and cause a sale of the properties 
if we elect to remarket the properties  we have guaranteed the lessor a percentage of the cost of each property  in the aggregate amount of approximately million the residual value 
we have also provided a residual value guarantee related to the synthetic lease  which has been recorded at the estimated fair value of the residual guarantee 

table of contents the sum of future minimum lease payments under the synthetic lease is approximately million at january  and such amounts are included in the future minimum lease payments presented above 
the synthetic lease contains covenants that must be complied with  similar to the covenants described in certain of the credit facilities 
as of january   we were in compliance with all such covenants 
guarantees as is customary in the technology industry  to encourage certain customers to purchase product from us  we have arrangements with certain finance companies that provide inventory financing facilities for our customers 
in conjunction with certain of these arrangements  we have agreements with the finance companies that would require us to repurchase certain inventory  which might be repossessed from the customers by the finance companies 
due to various reasons  including among other items  the lack of information regarding the amount of saleable inventory purchased from us still on hand with the customer at any point in time  our repurchase obligations relating to inventory cannot be reasonably estimated 
repurchases of inventory by us under these arrangements have been insignificant to date 
we also provide additional financial guarantees to finance companies on behalf of certain customers 
the majority of these guarantees are for an indefinite period of time  where we would be required to perform if the customer is in default with the finance company related to purchases made from the company 
the company reviews the underlying credit for these guarantees on at least an annual basis 
as of january  and  the aggregate amount of guarantees under these arrangements totaled approximately million and million  respectively  of which approximately million and million  respectively  was outstanding 
we believe that  based on historical experience  the likelihood of a material loss pursuant to the above guarantees is remote 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a large global organization  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material impact on our financial results in the future 
in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies 
it is our policy to utilize financial instruments to reduce risks where internal netting cannot be effectively employed 
additionally  we do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
with respect to our internal netting practices  we will consider inventory as an economic hedge against foreign currency exposure in accounts payable in certain circumstances 
this practice offsets such inventory against corresponding accounts payables denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary buying the inventory  when determining our net exposure to be hedged using traditional forward contracts 
under this strategy  we would expect to increase or decrease our selling prices for product purchased in foreign currencies based on fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affecting the underlying accounts payable 
to the extent we incur a foreign currency exchange loss gain on the underlying accounts payable denominated in the foreign currency  we would expect to see a corresponding increase decrease in gross profit as the related inventory is sold 
this strategy can result in a certain degree of quarterly earnings volatility as the underlying accounts payable is remeasured using the foreign currency exchange rate prevailing at the end of each period  or settlement date if earlier  whereas the corresponding increase decrease in gross profit is not realized until the related inventory is sold 
our foreign currency exposure relates to our transactions in europe  canada and latin america  where the currency collected from customers can be different from the currency used to purchase the product 
during fiscal and  the underlying exposures are denominated primarily in the following currencies us dollar  brazilian real  british pound  canadian dollar  chilean peso  colombian peso  czech koruna  danish krone  euros  mexican peso  norwegian krone  peruvian new sol  polish zloty  romanian leu  swedish krona and swiss franc 
our foreign currency risk management objective is to protect our earnings and cash flows from the adverse impact of exchange rate changes through the use of foreign currency forward and swap contracts to primarily hedge loans  accounts receivable and accounts payable 
we are also exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our short term debt used to maintain liquidity and to finance working capital  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
interest rate risk is also present in the forward foreign currency contracts hedging intercompany and loans 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to minimize overall borrowing costs 
to achieve our objective  we use a combination of fixed and variable rate debt 
the nature and amount of our long term and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
we utilize various financing instruments  such as receivables securitization  leases  revolving credit facilities  and trade receivable purchase facilities  to finance working capital needs 
in order to provide an assessment of the company s foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risk  the company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value at risk var model 
the var model consisted of using a monte carlo simulation to generate  random market price paths 
the var model determines the potential impact of the fluctuation in foreign exchange rates and interest rates assuming a one day holding period  normal market conditions and a confidence level 
the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value for a given confidence interval to the company s foreign exchange portfolio due to adverse movements in the rates 
the model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool 
firm commitments  assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model 

table of contents the following table represents the estimated maximum potential one day loss in fair value at a confidence level  calculated using the var model at january  and we believe that the hypothetical loss in fair value of our foreign exchange derivatives would be offset by the gains in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged 
var as of january  january  in thousands currency rate sensitive financial instruments interest rate sensitive financial instruments combined portfolio actual future gains and losses associated with the company s derivative positions may differ materially from the analyses performed as of january   due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the changes in the timing and amount of interest rates  foreign currency exchanges rates  and the company s actual exposures and positions
