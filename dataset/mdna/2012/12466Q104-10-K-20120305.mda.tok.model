continued weakness in the global and united states financial markets could further affect the corporation s performance  both directly by affecting the corporation s revenues and the value of its assets and liabilities  and indirectly by affecting the corporation s counterparties and the economy in general 
while there are some signs of improvement in the economic environment  there was a prolonged period of volatility and disruption in the markets  and unemployment has risen to  and remains at  high levels 
there can be no assurance that these unprecedented developments will not continue to materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations  as well as our ability to raise capital for liquidity and business purposes 
although the corporation had  and continues to have  diverse sources of liquidity and its capital ratios exceeded  and continue to exceed  the minimum levels required for well capitalized status  the corporation issued and sold its series a preferred stock and warrant for a million investment from the united states department of the treasury under the capital purchase program on january  on july   the corporation redeemed million  or percent  of its series a preferred stock 
the funds for this redemption were provided by existing financial resources of the corporation 

table of contents our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions 
financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading  clearing  counterparty or other relationships  and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry  including brokers and dealers  commercial banks  and other institutions 
as a result  defaults by  or even rumors or questions about defaults by  one or more financial services institutions  or the financial services industry generally  could create another market wide liquidity crisis similar to that experienced in late and early and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions 
there is no assurance that any such losses would not materially adversely affect the corporation s results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the actions taken by the federal government and regulatory agencies will stabilize the united states financial system or alleviate the industry or economic factors that may adversely affect the corporation s business and financial performance 
further  many aspects of the dodd frank act remain subject to rulemaking and will take effect over several years  making it difficult to anticipate the overall effect on the corporation s business and financial performance 
these risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating the forward looking statements contained herein 
we caution readers not to place undue reliance on those statements  which speak only as of the date of this report 
the following discussion supplements and provides information about the major components of the results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and capital resources of the corporation 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions 
those accounting policies with the greatest uncertainty and that require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments affecting the application of these policies  and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions  or using different assumptions  are described below 
allowance for loan losses we establish the allowance for loan losses through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when we believe that the collection of the principal is unlikely 
subsequent recoveries of losses previously charged against the allowance are credited to the allowance 
the allowance represents an amount that  in our judgment  will be adequate to absorb any losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible 
our judgment in determining the level of the allowance is based on evaluations of the collectibility of loans while taking into consideration such factors as trends in delinquencies and charge offs  changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions that may affect a borrower s ability to repay and the value of collateral  overall portfolio quality and review of specific potential losses 
this evaluation is inherently subjective because it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
for more information see the section titled asset quality within item allowance for indemnifications the allowance for indemnifications is established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for indemnifications  which is included in other noninterest expenses 
a loss is charged against the allowance for indemnifications under certain conditions when a purchaser of a loan investor sold by c f mortgage incurs a loss due to borrower misrepresentation  fraud  early default  or underwriting error 
the allowance represents an amount that  in management s judgment  will be adequate to absorb any losses arising from indemnification requests 
management s judgment in determining the level of the allowance is based on the volume of loans sold  current economic conditions and information provided by investors 
this evaluation is inherently subjective  as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
impairment of loans we consider a loan impaired when it is probable that the corporation will be unable to collect all interest and principal payments as scheduled in the loan agreement 
we do not consider a loan impaired during a period of delay in payment if we expect the ultimate collection of all amounts due 
we measure impairment on a loan by loan basis for commercial  construction and residential loans in excess of  by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s obtainable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment 
we maintain a valuation allowance to the extent that the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment 
troubled debt restructurings tdrs are also considered impaired loans  even if the loan balance is less than  a tdr occurs when we agree to significantly modify the original terms of a loan due to the deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower 
for more information see the section titled asset quality within item impairment of securities impairment of securities occurs when the fair value of a security is less than its amortized cost 
for debt securities  impairment is considered other than temporary and recognized in its entirety in net income if either i we intend to sell the security or ii it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis 
if  however  we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery  we must determine what portion of the impairment is attributable to a credit loss  which occurs when the amortized cost basis of the security exceeds the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected from the security 
if there is no credit loss  there is no other than temporary impairment 
if there is a credit loss  other than temporary impairment exists  and the credit loss must be recognized in net income and the remaining portion of impairment must be recognized in other comprehensive income 
for equity securities  impairment is considered to be other than temporary based on our ability and intent to hold the investment until a recovery of fair value 
other than temporary impairment of an equity security results in a write down that must be included in net income 
we regularly review each investment security for other than temporary impairment based on criteria that includes the extent to which cost exceeds market price  the duration of that market decline  the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer  our best estimate of the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from debt securities  our intention with regard to holding the security to maturity and the likelihood that we would be required to sell the security before recovery 

table of contents other real estate owned oreo assets acquired through  or in lieu of  loan foreclosure are held for sale and are initially recorded at the lower of the loan balance or the fair value less costs to sell at the date of foreclosure 
subsequent to foreclosure  management periodically performs valuations of the foreclosed assets based on updated appraisals  general market conditions  recent sales of like properties  length of time the properties have been held  and our ability and intention with regard to continued ownership of the properties 
the corporation may incur additional write downs of foreclosed assets to fair value less costs to sell if valuations indicate a further other than temporary deterioration in market conditions 
goodwill goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life 
in assessing the recoverability of the corporation s goodwill  all of which was recognized in connection with the bank s acquisition of c f finance company in september  we must make assumptions in order to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
major assumptions used in determining impairment were increases in future income  sales multiples in determining terminal value and the discount rate applied to future cash flows 
as part of the impairment test  we performed a sensitivity analysis by increasing the discount rate  lowering sales multiples and reducing increases in future income 
we completed the annual test for impairment during the fourth quarter of and determined there was no impairment to be recognized in with the adoption of accounting standards update  intangible goodwill and other testing goodwill for impairment  in  the corporation will no longer be required to complete a test for impairment unless  based on an assessment of qualitative factors related to goodwill  we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of c f finance company is less than its carrying amount 
if the likelihood of impairment is more than percent  the corporation will perform a test for impairment and we may be required to record impairment charges 
retirement plan the bank maintains a non contributory  defined benefit pension plan for eligible full time employees as specified by the plan 
plan assets  which consist primarily of mutual funds invested in marketable equity securities and corporate and government fixed income securities  are valued using market quotations 
the bank s actuary determines plan obligations and annual pension expense using a number of key assumptions 
key assumptions may include the discount rate  the interest crediting rate  the estimated future return on plan assets and the anticipated rate of future salary increases 
changes in these assumptions in the future  if any  or in the method under which benefits are calculated may impact pension assets  liabilities or expense 
derivative financial instruments the corporation recognizes derivative financial instruments at fair value as either an other asset or other liability in the consolidated balance sheet 
the derivative financial instruments have been designated as and qualify as cash flow hedges 
the effective portion of the gain or loss on the cash flow hedges is reported as a component of other comprehensive income  net of deferred taxes  and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
accounting for income taxes determining the corporation s effective tax rate requires judgment 
in the ordinary course of business  there are transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax outcomes are uncertain 
in addition  the corporation s tax returns are subject to audit by various tax authorities 
although we believe that the estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be materially different than that which is reflected in the income tax provision and accrual
