we currently have customers in over countries  and approximately  and of our revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively  were derived internationally 
we have a differentiated business model designed to accelerate the adoption of our product to reduce the time and cost to purchase and implement our software platform 
our low risk approach to product sales provides a needed alternative to costly  all or nothing  traditional business intelligence models 
we initially focus on specific business users or departments within a prospective customer s organization and seek to solve a targeted business need 
after demonstrating qlikview s benefits to initial adopters within an organization  we work to expand sales of our product to other business units  geographies and use cases with the long term goal of broad organizational deployment 
we license qlikview under perpetual licenses which generally include one year of maintenance as part of the initial purchase price of the product 
our customers can renew  and generally have renewed  their maintenance agreements for a fee that is based upon a percentage of the initial license fee paid 
for the year ended december   our total revenue was comprised of license revenue  maintenance revenue and professional services revenue 
for each of the years ended december  and  our total revenue was comprised of license revenue  maintenance revenue and professional services revenue 
we have a diversified distribution model that consists of a direct sales force and a partner network of resellers  oem relationships and systems integrators 
total billings from our oem relationships accounted for approximately of our total billings during the year ended december  additionally  our online qlikcommunity provides us with a loyal and growing network of users who promote our software  provide support for other users and contribute valuable insights and feedback for our product development efforts 
to complement qlikview  we have developed a differentiated business model that has the following attributes broad user focus marketing and selling qlikview directly to the business user by providing an easy to use platform that can be used with minimal training 
low risk rapid product adoption providing a low risk alternative to costly  all or nothing  enterprise wide deployment requirements

in evaluating our operating results we focus on the productivity of our sales force  the effectiveness of our local and corporate level marketing  our ability to close opportunities generated by our marketing leads and the competitiveness of our technology 
in each of these areas  we have taken steps designed to improve our operating results  including undertaking additional sales training for our sales representatives  hiring more experienced regional sales management  investing further in our corporate website to improve its use as an effective lead generative tool  developing a partner enablement program to focus on the results of our sales partners around the world and expanding our research and development staff with a focus on testing and quality assurance 
we believe the credit and economic conditions within certain european countries have continued to deteriorate 
should the deterioration of these conditions continue  it may result in an increase in the average length of time in our sales cycle and the average length of time it takes to collect outstanding accounts receivable in these countries 

table of contents from a risk perspective  we have had to deal with the impact of the recessionary global environment during the past several years  and the unsettled global economic environment could affect our operating results in future periods 
approximately of our revenue during the december  was derived internationally  of which was derived in europe 
we have faced pricing pressure from some of our competitors and believe we have minimized the impact by demonstrating the value delivered by qlikview in comparison to these other business intelligence products 
also  the rapid growth in our business has required the continued hiring of experienced staff across all of our geographic territories 
to aid this effort we have focused on improving our local recruiting initiatives  as well as on developing further internal training programs to prepare executives for greater responsibilities 
we were founded in sweden in from until  our activities were focused on software research and development that resulted in qlikview s core technology  and from until we focused on the commercialization of our technology primarily in the nordic market and limited regions of europe 
in late  we reincorporated in delaware and began to broaden our marketing and sales activities in the us and continued our expansion globally 
key financial metrics and trends revenues our revenue is comprised of license  maintenance and professional services 
we license our software under perpetual licenses which generally include one year of maintenance as part of the initial purchase price of the product 
license revenue reflects the revenue recognized from sales of licenses to new customers and additional licenses to existing customers 
historically  the majority of our license revenues have come from new customers 
however  going forward we seek to increase the contribution from existing customers based upon our land and expand sales strategy 
customers can renew  and generally have renewed  their maintenance agreements for a fee that is based upon a percentage of the initial license fee paid 
current customers with maintenance agreements are entitled to receive unspecified upgrades and enhancements when and if they become available 
we have experienced growth in maintenance revenue primarily due to increased license sales and growth in our customer base and high retention of those customers 
in each of the years ended december  and  our annual maintenance renewal rates exceeded 
professional services revenue is comprised of training  installation and other consulting revenues 
given the ease of implementation of our product and our relationship with our partners  professional services revenue for the years ended december   and were  and  respectively  of total revenues 
we do not expect that proportion to change significantly during the near term 
prior to  we generated the majority of sales through our direct sales channel rather than through our partner network 
however  the contribution from our partner network continues to grow  and we anticipate that revenues from partners will continue to be more than of total revenues 
given the size of the us market and our current limited penetration there  we expect that the us will represent our largest growth opportunity during the near term and will likely be an important contributor to future revenue growth 
due to the global diversity of our customer base  our results are impacted by movements in the currencies of the major territories in which we operate 
the primary currencies impacting results are the us dollar our functional currency  the swedish kronor  the euro and the british pound 
inflation and changing prices had no material effect on our sales  revenue or income from operations during the years ended december   and cost of revenue cost of revenue primarily consists of personnel costs  fees paid to subcontractors providing technical support services  referral fees paid to third parties in connection with software license sales and other discrete professional services 
personnel costs include salaries  employee benefit and social costs  bonuses  stock based compensation and direct overhead 
operating expenses we classify our operating expenses into three categories sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative 
our operating expenses primarily consist of personnel costs  travel costs  sales commissions  marketing program costs  facilities  legal  accounting  consulting  the cost of our annual employee summit  other professional services costs and depreciation and amortization 
personnel costs include salaries  employee benefit and social costs  bonuses  stock based compensation and direct overhead 
historically  we have focused on the continued growth of our license revenues  and as a result  sales and marketing has represented the largest amount of total expenses both in absolute dollar terms and as a percentage of total revenues 
going forward  we expect to drive greater efficiencies from this cost base and consequently expect that sales and marketing as a percentage of revenues will decline in the long term 
conversely  we project that research and development expenses will remain constant or grow as a percentage of total revenues as we continue to invest in future product enhancements and new products 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel costs for our sales  marketing and business development employees and executives  commissions earned by our sales personnel  travel costs  facilities costs attributable to our sales and marketing personnel  the cost of marketing programs  the cost of employee training programs  and the cost of business development programs 
we expect to continue to hire additional sales personnel in the us and in our international locations in 
table of contents research and development 
research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel and facility costs for our research and development and product marketing employees 
we have devoted our development efforts primarily to enhancing the functionality and expanding the capabilities of our software platform  including  for example  the development of our qlikview mobile client released in 
we expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in the long term as we increase our research and development and product marketing headcount to further strengthen and enhance our software platform 
the vast majority of our research and development staff is based in lund  sweden 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel costs for our executive  finance  legal  human resources and administrative personnel  as well as the cost of facilities attributable to general and administrative operations  the cost of employee training programs  depreciation and amortization  legal  accounting  other professional services fees and other corporate expenses 
we incurred additional costs in and and expect to continue to incur higher costs associated with being a public company  including higher legal  directors and officers insurance and accounting expenses  as well as the costs of maintaining compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act and related regulations 
we also expect that general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars because of our efforts to expand our international operations  but we believe over time general and administrative costs will decline as a percentage of revenues as we expect to derive greater efficiencies from our corporate infrastructure 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense is based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant 
we use the black scholes merton black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of common stock option awards 
the fair value of a restricted stock unit is determined by using the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
the estimated fair value of maximum value stock settled stock appreciation rights mvsssars is determined by utilizing a lattice model under the option pricing method 
the estimated fair value of stock based compensation awards on the date of grant is amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
stock based compensation expense is recorded within cost of revenue  sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses 
other income expense  net other income expense  net primarily consists of net interest  change in the fair value of warrants  foreign exchange gains losses and other income or expense 
net interest represents interest income received on our cash and cash equivalents and interest expense associated with outstanding debt 
foreign exchange gains losses relate to the business activities in foreign countries and the re measurement of intercompany transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional reporting currency  the us dollar 
as a result of our business activities in foreign countries  we expect that foreign exchange gains losses will continue to occur due to fluctuations in exchange rates in the countries where we do business 
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes primarily consists of corporate income taxes related to income at our us and international subsidiaries 
the provision includes amounts for us federal  state and foreign income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the forecast of future taxable income  the remaining time period to utilize any tax operating losses and tax credits and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize deferred tax assets 
in evaluating our ability to realize deferred tax assets  we consider all available positive and negative evidence 
our negative evidence includes historical taxable losses generated by certain subsidiaries 
our positive evidence includes historical taxable income at certain subsidiaries as well as projected future taxable income 
in determining future taxable income  we make assumptions for the amount of taxable income  the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require us to make judgments about our future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our business 
the effective tax rates for and were and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for reflects a million non cash charge related to the need for a valuation allowance against certain us deferred tax assets 
impact of foreign currency translation approximately  and of our operating revenues for the years ended december   and were earned in foreign denominated currencies  including the euro  the british pound and the swedish kronor 
we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means  including managing same currency revenues in relation to same currency costs and same currency assets in relation to same currency liabilities 
as we operate in multiple foreign currencies  changes in those currencies relative to the us dollar will impact our revenues and expenses 
if the us dollar weakens against a specific foreign currency  our revenues will increase having a positive impact on net income  and our overall expenses will increase  having a negative impact on net income 
likewise  if the us dollar strengthens against a specific foreign currency  our revenues will decrease having a negative impact on net income  and our overall expenses will decrease  having a positive impact on net income 
therefore  significant shifts in foreign currencies can impact our short term results  as well as our long term forecasts and targets 
total revenue for the year ended december  was positively impacted by approximately million due to the general weakening of the us dollar relative to the euro  the british pound and the swedish kronor 
total cost of revenue and operating expenses for the year ended december  were negatively impacted by approximately million due to the general weakening of the us dollar relative to the euro  the british pound and the swedish kronor

table of contents research and development

included in the higher personnel costs is million due to changes in the value of the swedish kronor relative to the us dollar as the vast majority of our research and development staff is based in lund  sweden

other income expense  net 
other expense was million for the year ended december  compared to expense of million for the year ended december  we had a million foreign exchange loss and other expense for the year ended december  compared to a loss of million for the year ended december  the increase is largely due to the foreign currency impact of the us dollar generally weakening relative to the swedish kronor during the year ended december  this increase was offset by a decrease in net interest expense of million primarily due to the prepayment of our outstanding note payable balance in july provision for income taxes 
our annual effective tax rate for the year ended december  was  which results in a provision for income taxes of approximately million 
the effective tax rate increased from the annual effective tax rate of due primarily to a change in the amount of income earned in the various locations where we operate from one year to the next  charges recorded for the change in value of our preferred stock warrants and stock based compensation expense incurred by our us holding company 
we operate in an international environment with significant operations in various locations outside of the us accordingly  the consolidated income tax rate is a composite rate reflecting our earnings losses and the applicable tax rates in the various locations where we operate 
foreign exchange rates we conduct business in our foreign operations in local currencies 
accordingly  our revenue and operating expense results presented above are affected by changes in foreign exchange rates 
income and expense accounts are translated at the average monthly exchange rates during the period 
total revenue for the year ended december  was positively impacted by approximately million due to the general weakening of the us dollar relative to the euro  the british pound and the swedish kronor 
total cost of revenue and operating expenses for the year ended december  were negatively impacted by approximately million due to the general weakening of the us dollar relative to the euro  the british pound and the swedish kronor 
seasonality our quarterly results reflect seasonality in the sale of our products and services 
historically  a pattern of increased license sales in the fourth quarter has positively impacted sales activity in that period which can make it difficult to achieve sequential revenue growth in the first quarter 
in addition  our european operations occasionally provide lower revenues in the summer months because of the generally reduced level of economic activity in europe during those months 
similarly  our gross margins and operating income have been affected by these historical trends because the majority of our expenses are relatively fixed in the near term 
the timing of revenues in relation to our expenses  much of which does not vary directly with revenue  has an impact on the cost of revenue  sales and marketing expense  research and development expense and general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue in each calendar quarter during the year 
the majority of our expenses is personnel related and includes salaries  stock based compensation  benefits and incentive based compensation plan expenses 
as a result  we have not experienced significant seasonal fluctuations in the timing of expenses from period to period  other than an increase in total operating expenses during the first quarter of each year as a result of our annual employee summit and an increase in sales and marketing expenses in the second quarter of each year due to our annual partner event 
on a quarterly basis  we have usually generated the majority of our revenues in the final month of each quarter and a significant amount in the last two weeks of a quarter 
we believe this is due to customer buying patterns typical in this industry 
although these seasonal factors are common in the technology sector  historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance 

table of contents acquisitions on january   we completed our acquisition of syllogic corporation for total consideration of million 
the purchase price consisted of  shares of common stock valued at million and contingent cash consideration of million  which is estimated to be paid out over a four year period 
the total maximum contingent cash consideration that could be paid pursuant to the agreement is million 
during the fourth quarter of  we estimated that the total maximum contingent cash consideration of million would be paid based on the achievement of certain financial targets 
we recorded an additional million related to this change in the estimated fair value of this contingent consideration liability within sales and marketing expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  we paid million of the contingent consideration liability through december  based on the achievement of certain financial targets 
we account for acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
in each case  we allocated the purchase price to the assets acquired  including intangible assets and liabilities assumed  based on estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations through the sale of preferred stock and common stock  cash flows generated by operations and borrowings under debt instruments 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million  net accounts receivable of million and working capital of million 
as of december   we had approximately million of our total cash and cash equivalents in banking institutions outside of the us  of which  approximately million is held in euro based bank accounts in european countries 
as of december   we had approximately million of our total accounts receivable due from customers within the european union 
our capital expenditures for were million  comprised primarily of additional leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures and computer equipment 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations and our capital expenditures for at least the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the expansion of our sales and marketing activities  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and expansion into new territories  the timing of introductions of new software products and enhancements to existing software products and the continuing market acceptance of our software offerings

non gaap financial measures we use measures of non generally accepted accounting principles non gaap income from operations  non gaap net income and non gaap net income per common share 
we believe that the non gaap financial information provided can assist investors in understanding and assessing our on going core operations and prospects for the future 
this non gaap financial information provides an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our financial results with other companies in our industry  many of which present similar non gaap financial measures to investors 
for the year ended december  and  non gaap income from operations is determined by taking income from operations and adding back non cash stock based compensation expense  employer payroll taxes related to stock transactions  secondary offering expenses  contingent consideration adjustments and lease termination costs 
non gaap net income is determined by taking pre tax income and adding back non cash stock based compensation expense  employer payroll taxes on stock transactions  secondary offering expenses  contingent consideration adjustments and lease termination costs  and the result is tax affected at an estimated long term effective tax rate of

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  costs and expenses  and related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management 
to the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results  our future financial statement presentation  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows will be affected 
we believe that these accounting policies are critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates 
there were no material changes to our critical accounting policies and use of estimates during the year ended december  revenue recognition we derive substantially all of our revenue from the licensing of our software platform and associated maintenance agreements and from the sale of training and other consulting services 
we require one year of maintenance as part of the initial purchase price of each software offering and then sell annual renewals of this maintenance agreement 
we recognize revenue for software  maintenance and professional services when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
as substantially all of our software licenses are sold in multiple element arrangements that include either maintenance or both maintenance and professional services  we use the residual method to determine the amount of license revenue to be recognized 
under the residual method  consideration is allocated to undelivered elements based upon vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of those elements  with the residual amount of the arrangement fee allocated to and recognized as license revenue 
we have established vsoe of the fair value of maintenance through independent maintenance renewals which demonstrate a consistent relationship of maintenance pricing as a percentage of the contractual license fee 
maintenance revenues are deferred and recognized ratably over the contractual period of the maintenance arrangement which is generally months 
arrangements that include other professional services are evaluated to determine whether those services are essential to the functionality of other elements of the arrangement 
we have determined that these services are not considered essential and the amounts allocated to the services are recognized as revenue when the services are performed 
the vsoe of fair value of our professional services is based on the price for these same services when they are sold separately 
revenue for services that are sold either on a stand alone basis or included in multiple element arrangements is recognized as the services are performed 
for sales through resellers  we recognize revenue upon the shipment of the product only if those resellers provide us  at the time of placing their order  with the identity of the end user customer to whom the product has been sold 
our resellers do not carry inventory of our software 
sales through resellers are evidenced by a reseller agreement  together with purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
we also sell software licenses to oems who integrate our product for distribution with their applications 
we do not currently offer any rights to return products sold to resellers or oems 
the oem s end user customer is licensed to use our products solely in conjunction with the oem s application 
in oem arrangements  key delivery is required as the basis for revenue recognition 
however  depending upon the oem partner s business model we recognize revenue either up front or over time in subscription or royalty based models 
we do not offer specified upgrades or incrementally significant discounts 
we record advance payments as deferred revenues until the product is shipped  services are delivered or obligations are met and the revenue can be recognized 
deferred revenues represent the excess of amounts invoiced or paid over amounts recognized as revenues 
deferred revenues to be recognized as revenues within the next twelve months have been classified as current liabilities and deferred revenues to be recognized as revenues beyond the next twelve months have been classified as non current liabilities 
any contingencies  such as rights of return  conditions of acceptance  and warranties are accounted for as a separate element 
the effect of accounting for these contingencies included in revenue arrangements has not been material 

table of contents stock based compensation our stock based compensation is as follows september  september  september  year ended december  in thousands cost of revenue sales and marketing research and development general and administrative common stock options for the years ended december   and  we calculated the fair value of common stock options granted using the black scholes pricing model with the following assumptions september  september  september  year ended december  expected dividend yield risk free interest rate expected volatility expected life swedish grants  in years expected life all other grants  in years we use the black scholes option pricing model to value our common stock option awards 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the stock based payment awards and stock price volatility 
for stock options granted  since our historical stock data from our ipo in july is less than the expected life of the stock option  we have used a blended volatility to estimate expected volatility 
the blended volatility includes a weighting of our historical volatility from the date of our ipo to the respective grant date and an average of our peer group historical volatility consistent with the expected life of the option 
our peer group historical volatility includes the historical volatility of companies that are similar in revenue size  in the same industry or are competitors 
we expect to continue to use a larger proportion of our historical volatility in future periods as we develop additional historical experience of our own stock price fluctuations considered in relation to the expected life of the option 
the expected term for option grants to employees based in sweden is four years based on the contractual expiration date and our historical experience 
the expected term for all other grants is based on the simplified method 
the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury yield curve with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at grant 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock based payment awards represent management s best estimate and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
as a result  if factors change and management uses different assumptions  stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
following our ipo  we established a policy of using the closing sale price per share of our common stock as quoted on the nasdaq global market on the date of grant for purposes of determining the exercise price per share of our options to purchase common stock 
for all common stock options  we recognize expense over the requisite service period using the straight line method 
in addition to the assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the options  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate of all stock based awards and only recognize expense for those awards expected to vest 
the estimation of the number of common stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period in which estimates are revised 
we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including types of awards  employee class and an analysis of our historical and known forfeitures on existing awards 
during the period in which the options vest  we will record additional expense if the actual forfeiture rate is lower than estimated and a recovery of expense if the actual forfeiture rate is higher than estimated 
as of december   there was approximately million of unrecognized stock based compensation expense  net of estimated forfeitures  related to non vested employee and non employee director common stock option awards that we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of years 

table of contents based upon the closing price of our common stock on december  of  the aggregate intrinsic value of common stock options outstanding as of december  was million  of which million related to vested common stock options and million related to unvested common stock options 
restricted stock units the fair value of a restricted stock unit is determined using the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
a restricted stock unit award entitles the holder to receive shares of our common stock as the award vests 
vesting may be based on length of service  the attainment of performance based milestones or a combination of both 
for all restricted stock unit awards  we recognize expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
as of december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost  net of estimated forfeitures  related to the unvested restricted stock unit awards 
the remaining cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years 
maximum value stock settled appreciation rights the estimated fair value of a mvsssar is determined by utilizing a lattice model under the option pricing method 
mvsssars contain a predetermined cap on the maximum stock price at which point the instrument must be exercised 
at exercise  employees holding mvsssars will receive shares of our common stock with a value equal to the difference between the exercise price and the then current market price per share of our common stock  subject to a predetermined cap 
the exercise price of mvsssars is determined by using the last sales price of our common stock on the date of grant 
vesting is based on length of service 
for all mvsssars  we recognize expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
the key inputs to the lattice model are the current price of our common stock  the fair value of our common stock at date of grant  the maximum fair value at which the mvsssars must be exercised  the vesting period  the contractual term  the volatility  the risk free interest rate  the employment termination rate and the assumptions with respect to early exercise behavior 
as of december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested mvsssars 
the remaining cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years 
research and development expense for software products software development costs are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established  at which time such costs are capitalized to the extent that the capitalizable costs do not exceed the realizable value of such costs  until the product is available for general release to customers 
based on our product development process  technological feasibility is established upon the completion of a working model of the software product that has been tested to be consistent with the product design specifications and that is free of any uncertainties related to high risk development issues 
costs incurred by us between completion of the working model and the point at which the product is ready for general release has been insignificant 
accordingly  we have charged all such costs to research and development expense 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the respective financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
for the year ended december   our tax provision consists principally of foreign tax expense and a million non cash income tax charge related to the need for a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets 
for the year ended december   our tax provision consists principally of foreign  us federal and state tax expense 
we continue to assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in assessing the realizability of these deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
we establish valuation allowances when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include our latest forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
as of december  and  our deferred tax assets had a valuation allowance of million and million 
during the year ended december   a valuation allowance was established against certain of our deferred tax assets that resulted from the uncertain realizability of those assets 
because of certain prior period ownership changes  the utilization of a portion of our us federal and state nol carry forward may be limited 
we have not finalized our analysis to determine the annual limitation  but we estimate that approximately million of our us federal and state net operating losses may be limited which has been reflected in our valuation allowance at december  if we were to determine that certain amounts of the million were not limited  a portion of our valuation allowance could be reversed 

table of contents we use a more likely than not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of tax positions taken 
tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of the tax benefits  determined on a cumulative probability basis  which is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement in the financial statements 
we recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in provision for income taxes 
at december  and  our reserve for uncertain tax positions was million and million  respectively 
we identify  evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of these positions that may not be sustained  or may only partially be sustained  upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities 
although we believe that our estimates and judgments were reasonable  actual results may differ from these estimates 
some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities 
our annual provision for income taxes and the determination of the resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities involve a significant amount of management judgment 
management s judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
we operate within federal  state and international taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve 
we accrue interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 
as of december  and  there was million and million  respectively  of accrued interest and penalties 
we expect the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries will continue to be reinvested indefinitely 
accordingly  at december   no provision has been made for us federal and state income taxes of these foreign earnings of million 
upon distribution of these earnings  in the form of dividends or otherwise  we may be subject to us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes 
the determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred us income tax liability on these earnings is not practicable because of the complexities with the hypothetical calculations 
contractual obligations and commitments off balance sheet arrangements the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
september  september  september  september  september  payment due by period 
total less than year to years to years more than years dollars in thousands operating lease obligations we generally do not enter into long term minimum purchase commitments 
our principal commitments consist of obligations under facility leases for office space 
on january   we completed our acquisition of syllogic corporation syllogic for total consideration of million 
the purchase price included a contingent cash consideration of million  which is estimated to be paid out over a four year period 
the total maximum contingent cash consideration that could be paid pursuant to the agreement is million 
during the fourth quarter of  we estimated that the total maximum contingent cash consideration of million would be paid based on the achievement of certain financial targets 
we recorded an additional million related to this change in the estimated fair value of this contingent consideration liability within sales and marketing expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  we paid million of the contingent consideration liability through december  based on the achievement of certain financial targets 
in may  we began to occupy a new leased facility in lund  sweden  and simultaneously ceased use of our previous leased facility in lund 
in july  we reached an agreement with the landlord of the previous leased facility to allow us to terminate the lease agreement in exchange for a lease termination fee of million swedish kronor approximately million based on an assumed exchanged rate of as of the date of payment 
in october  we paid the lease termination fee 
in addition to the lease termination fee  we incurred million in rent charges following its abandonment of the previous leased facility as well as an impairment charge of million related to the write off of leasehold improvements from the previous leased facility 
these items resulted in aggregate lease termination costs of million and are recorded in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  on june   we entered into two new lease agreements the new lease agreements with fastighets ab remulus lund the property owner for the new leased facility and replace in their entirety the previous lease facility 
both new lease agreements expire on april  each new lease agreement will automatically renew upon expiration for additional three year terms unless either party 
table of contents provides written notice to the other of such party s desire to not renew the applicable lease at least months prior to the end of the respective term 
the new lease agreements provide for the payment of annual base rent in the amount of approximately million swedish kronor approximately million based on an assumed exchange rate of approximately as of december   subject to annual increases 
in addition to the base rent  we are required to pay the property owner certain operating expenses and other fees in accordance with the terms of the new lease agreements 
the new lease agreements contain customary representations and covenants regarding occupancy  maintenance and care of the property 
we have obligations related to unrecognized tax benefit liabilities totaling million  which have been excluded from the tables above as we do not think it is practicable to make reliable estimates of the periods in which payment for these obligations will be made 
however  the following table estimates when these obligations will expire 
see note of our notes to the consolidated financial statements 
september  september  september  september  september  expiration by period total less than year to years to years thereafter dollars in thousands unrecognized tax benefit liabilities inflation normally  inflation does not have a significant impact on our operations as our products and services are not generally sold on long term contracts 
consequently  we can adjust our selling prices  to the extent permitted by competition  to reflect cost increases caused by inflation 
recent accounting pronouncements from time to time  new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb or other standard setting bodies that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date 
unless otherwise discussed  we believe that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations upon adoption 
in january  the fasb updated the accounting guidance related to fair value measurements disclosures 
the updated guidance i requires separate disclosure of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements  ii requires disclosure of level fair value measurements activity on a gross basis  iii clarifies existing disaggregation requirements and iv clarifies existing input and valuation technique disclosure requirements 
the updated guidance was effective for us for interim or annual periods beginning after january   except for level fair value measurement disclosure requirements  which are effective for fiscal years beginning after january  we adopted the aspects of the guidance on january  and adopted the remaining guidance on january  the adoption of the guidance had no material impact on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
in june  the fasb issued an asu no 
 comprehensive income topic topic  presentation of comprehensive income 
asu no 
requires companies to present comprehensive income in a single statement below net income or in a separate statement of comprehensive income immediately following the income statement 
this update does not change which items are reported in other comprehensive income or the requirement to report reclassifications of items from other comprehensive income to net income 
this requirement will become effective for us beginning with the quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended march  and will require retrospective application for all periods presented 
in september  the fasb issued an asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment 
under asu  an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if the entity determines that this threshold is not met  then performing the two step impairment is unnecessary 
asu is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this update is not expected to have an impact on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not hold financial instruments for trading purposes 
market risk we are exposed to certain financial risks  including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we manage our exposure to these market risks through internally established policies and procedures 
our policies do not allow speculation in derivative instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument contracts for which there are no underlying exposures 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and we are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
we monitor our underlying market risk exposures on an ongoing basis and believe that we can modify or adapt our hedging strategies as needed 
interest rate sensitivity we had cash and cash equivalents of million at december  and million at december  we held these amounts primarily in cash or money market funds 
we hold cash and cash equivalents for working capital purposes 
we do not have material exposure to market risk with respect to investments  as our investments consist primarily of highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes  however  we may adopt specific hedging strategies in the future 
any declines in interest rates  however  will reduce future interest income 
foreign exchange risk we market our products in the americas  europe  the asia pacific regions  and africa and develop our products in europe 
as a result of our business activities in foreign countries  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions in foreign markets  and there is no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not harm our business in the future 
we sell our products in certain countries in the local currency of the respective country 
there is a risk that we will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to the competitive pressure when there has been significant volatility in foreign exchange rates 
in addition  our product development activities are principally based at our facility in lund  sweden 
this provides some natural hedging because most of our subsidiaries operating expenses are denominated in their local currencies 
regardless of this natural hedging  our results of operations may be adversely impacted by the exchange rate fluctuation 
although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations and  where appropriate  may use financial hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations  we are not currently engaged in any financial hedging transactions 
we may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposure for a variety of reasons  including accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposure 
foreign exchange risk exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than our functional currency and from foreign denominated revenue and profit translated into us dollars 
approximately  and of our operating revenues for the years ended december   and were earned in foreign denominated currencies other than the us dollar 
the principal foreign currencies in which we conduct business are the euro  the swedish kronor and the british pound 
the translation of currencies in which we operate into the us dollar may affect consolidated revenues and gross profit margins as expressed in us dollars 
we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means  including managing same currency revenues in relation to same currency costs and same currency assets in relation to same currency liabilities 
as we operate in multiple foreign currencies  changes in those currencies relative to the us dollar will impact our revenues and expenses 
if the us dollar weakens against a specific foreign currency  our revenues will increase having a positive impact on net income  and our overall expenses will increase  having a negative impact on net income 
likewise  if the us dollar strengthens against a specific foreign currency  our revenues will decrease having a negative impact on net income  and our overall expenses will decrease  having a positive impact on net income 
therefore  significant shifts in foreign currencies can impact our short term results  as well as our long term forecasts and targets 
our actual future gains and losses may differ materially due to the inherent limitations with the timing and amount of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and our actual exposure and positions
