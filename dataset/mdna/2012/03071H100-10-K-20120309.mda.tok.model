reinsurance involves an insurance company transferring to  or ceding  a portion of the exposure on a risk to a reinsurer 
the reinsurer assumes the exposure in return for a portion of our premium 
the cost and limits of reinsurance we purchase can vary from year to year based upon the availability of quality reinsurance at an acceptable price and our desired level of retention 
retention refers to the amount of risk that we retain for our own account 
under excess of loss reinsurance  covered losses in excess of the retention level up to the limit of the program are paid by the reinsurer 
our excess of loss reinsurance is written in layers  in which our reinsurers accept a band of coverage up to a specified amount 
any liability exceeding the limit of the program reverts to us as the ceding company 
reinsurance does not legally discharge us from primary liability for the full amount due under our policies 
however  our reinsurers are obligated to indemnify us to the extent of the coverage provided in our reinsurance agreements 
we believe reinsurance is critical to our business 
our reinsurance purchasing strategy is to protect against unforeseen and or catastrophic loss activity that would adversely impact our income and capital base 
we generally select financially strong reinsurers with an am best rating of a excellent or better at the time we enter into a reinsurance contract 
in addition  to minimize our exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies  we evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers and monitor concentrations of credit risk on a continual basis 
excess of loss reinsurance treaty program our reinsurance program is substantially similar to our program 
effective january   we entered into a new excess of loss reinsurance treaty program related to our voluntary and assigned risk business that applies to losses incurred between january  and the date on which our reinsurance agreements are terminated 
our reinsurance treaty program provides us with reinsurance coverage for each loss occurrence up to million  subject to applicable deductibles  retentions and aggregate limits 
however  for any loss occurrence involving only one claimant  our reinsurance coverage is limited to a maximum of million for that claimant  subject to applicable deductibles  retentions and aggregate limits 
we have reinsurers participating in our reinsurance treaty program 
under certain circumstances  including a downgrade of a reinsurer s am best rating to b very good or below  such reinsurer may be required to provide us with security for amounts due under the terms of our reinsurance program 
this security may take the form of  among other things  cash advances or letters of credit 
if security is required because of a ratings downgrade  the form of security must be mutually agreed to between the reinsurer and us 

table of contents our reinsurance treaty program provides coverage in the following three layers first layer 
this layer is part of our reinsurance treaty program  and is a three year structured product 
it covers losses incurred between january  and january  the treaty affords coverage in two parts up to million for each loss occurrence in excess of million 
before our reinsurers are obligated to reimburse us under this layer  we are subject to an annual aggregate deductible of of subject earned premium under the first part of this coverage and of subject earned premium under the second part of this coverage 
the limit under the first part of this coverage for all claims  including certain terrorism claims  is of subject earned premium in any one year and of subject earned premium in the aggregate for all three years covered by this layer 
the limit under the second part of this coverage for all claims  including certain terrorism claims  is of subject earned premium in the aggregate for all three years covered by this layer 
second layer 
this is a three year treaty covering losses incurred between january  and january  the treaty affords coverage up to million for each loss occurrence in excess of million 
the aggregate limit for all claims  including terrorism  under this layer is million in any one year and million in the aggregate for all three years covered by this layer 
our program included a similar layer effective between january  and january  third layer 
affords coverage up to million for each loss occurrence in excess of million 
the aggregate limit for all claims  including terrorism  under this layer is million 
the agreement for both parts of the first layer will terminate on january   the agreement for the second layer will terminate on january  and the third layer of coverage will terminate on january  in addition  we may terminate the participation of one or more of our reinsurers under certain circumstances as permitted by the terms of our reinsurance agreements 
at our option  we have the right to commute the reinsurers obligations under the agreement for the first and second layers of coverage at any time after the end of the applicable terms of the agreements 
if we commute the reinsurers obligations  we are entitled to receive a portion of the premiums that were paid to the reinsurers prior to the effective dates of the applicable commutations  subject to certain adjustments provided in the agreement

terrorism reinsurance the terrorism risk insurance act of the act was enacted in response to the events of september  and was extended by the terrorism risk insurance extension act of the act and the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of the act 
the act  the act and the act were designed to ensure the availability of insurance coverage for losses resulting from certain acts of terrorism in the united states 
the act reauthorizes a federal program  established under the act  extended by the act  and further extended it through the end of this program provides federal reimbursement to insurance companies for a portion of their losses arising from certain acts of terrorism and requires insurance companies to offer coverage for these acts 
the program applies to insured losses arising out of acts that are certified as acts of terrorism by the secretary of the treasury in concurrence with the secretary of state and the attorney general of the united states 
in addition  the program does not provide any reimbursement for any portion of aggregate industry wide insured losses from certified acts of terrorism that exceed billion in any one year and is subject to certain other limitations and restrictions 
for insured losses in  each insurance group is responsible for a statutory deductible under the act that is equal to of its direct earned property and casualty insurance premiums 
for losses occurring in  the us federal government will reimburse of an insurance group s covered losses over the statutory deductible 
in addition  no federal reimbursement is available unless the aggregate insurance industry wide losses from a certified act of terrorism exceed million for any act of terrorism occurring in however  there is no relief from the requirement under the act that insurance companies offer coverage for certified acts of terrorism if those acts do not cause losses exceeding these threshold amounts and thus do not result in any federal reimbursement payments 
under the act  insurance companies must offer coverage for losses due to certified acts of terrorism in their workers compensation policies 
moreover  the workers compensation laws of the various states generally 
table of contents do not permit the exclusion of coverage for losses arising from acts of terrorism  including terrorism that involves the use of nuclear  biological  radioactive or chemical agents 
in addition  state law prohibits us from limiting our workers compensation insurance losses arising from any one catastrophe or any one claimant 
we have reinsurance protection in our reinsurance treaty program that affords coverage for up to million for losses arising from terrorism but excluding nuclear  biological  radiological and chemical attacks  subject to the deductibles  retentions  definitions and aggregate limits 
technology we view our internally developed and purchased management information systems as an integral part of our operations and make a substantial ongoing investment in improving our systems 
we provide our field premium auditors  field safety professionals and field case managers with computer and communication equipment to more timely and efficiently complete services 
this technology also helps to facilitate communication and to report and monitor claims 
all of our systems development and infrastructure operation and maintenance are performed by our information technology professionals  with limited assistance from outside vendors 
competition the insurance industry  in general  is highly competitive and there is significant competition in the workers compensation segment of the industry 
competition in the insurance business is based on many factors  including premium rates  policy terms  coverage availability  claims management  safety services  payment terms  types of insurance offered  overall financial strength and financial ratings assigned by independent rating organizations  such as am best 
some of the insurers with which we compete have significantly greater financial  marketing and management resources than we do 
we may also compete with new market entrants in the future 
we believe the workers compensation market for the hazardous industries we target is more fragmented and to some degree less competitive than other segments of the workers compensation market 
our competitors include other insurance companies  individual self insured companies  state insurance pools and self insurance funds 
we estimate that more than insurance companies participate in the workers compensation market 
the insurance companies with which we compete vary by state and by the industries we target 
these market conditions are also impacted by lower estimated loss costs adopted by a number of states in which we do business 
our competitive advantages include our safety service and claims management practices  our am best rating and our ability to reduce claims through implementation of our work safety programs 
in addition  we believe that our insurance is competitively priced and our premium rates are typically lower than those for policyholders assigned to the state insurance pools  allowing us to provide a viable alternative for policyholders in those pools 
employees as of december   we had full time employees and one part time employee 
none of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements 
we believe that our employee relations are good 
regulation holding company regulation nearly all states have enacted legislation that regulates insurance holding company systems 
each insurance company in a holding company system is required to register with the insurance supervisory agency of its state of domicile and furnish information concerning the operations of companies within the holding company system that may materially affect the operations  management or financial condition of the insurers within the system 

table of contents under these laws  the respective state insurance departments may examine us at any time  require disclosure of material transactions and require prior notice of or approval for certain transactions 
all transactions within a holding company system affecting an insurer must have fair and reasonable terms and are subject to other standards and requirements established by law and regulation 
change of control the insurance holding company laws of nearly all states require advance approval by the respective state insurance departments of any change of control of an insurer 
control is generally presumed to exist through the direct or indirect ownership of or more of the voting securities of a domestic insurance company or any entity that controls a domestic insurance company 
in addition  insurance laws in many states contain provisions that require pre notification to the insurance commissioners of a change of control of a non domestic insurance company licensed in those states 
any future transactions that would constitute a change of control of american interstate  silver oak casualty or american interstate of texas  including a change of control of amerisafe  would generally require the party acquiring control to obtain the prior approval of the department of insurance in the state in which the insurance company being acquired is incorporated and may require pre notification in the states where pre notification provisions have been adopted 
obtaining these approvals may result in the material delay of  or deter  any such transaction 
these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay  deter or prevent a change of control of amerisafe  including through transactions  and in particular unsolicited transactions  that some or all of the shareholders of amerisafe might consider to be desirable 
state insurance regulation insurance companies are subject to regulation and supervision by the department of insurance in the state in which they are domiciled and  to a lesser extent  other states in which they conduct business 
american interstate and silver oak casualty are primarily subject to regulation and supervision by the louisiana department of insurance and workers compensation commission 
american interstate of texas is primarily subject to regulation and supervision by the texas department of insurance and workers compensation commission 
these state agencies have broad regulatory  supervisory and administrative powers  including among other things  the power to grant and revoke licenses to transact business  license agencies  set the standards of solvency to be met and maintained  determine the nature of  and limitations on  investments and dividends  approve policy forms and rates in some states  periodically examine financial statements  determine the form and content of required financial statements and periodically examine market conduct 
detailed annual and quarterly financial statements and other reports are required to be filed with the state insurance departments in all states in which we are licensed to transact business 
the financial statements of american interstate  silver oak casualty and american interstate of texas are subject to periodic examination by the department of insurance in each state in which they are licensed to do business 
in addition  many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer s ability to withdraw from a particular market 
for example  states may limit an insurer s ability to cancel or not renew policies 
furthermore  certain states prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more lines of business from the state  except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department 
the state insurance department may disapprove a plan that may lead to market disruption 
laws and regulations that limit cancellation and non renewal and that subject program withdrawals to prior approval requirements may restrict our ability to exit unprofitable markets 
insurance agencies are also subject to regulation and supervision by the state insurance departments in the states in which they are licensed 
our wholly owned subsidiary  amerisafe general agency  inc  is licensed as an insurance agent in states and as a managing general insurance agency in states 
amerisafe general agency is domiciled in louisiana and is primarily subject to regulation and supervision by the louisiana 
table of contents department of insurance  which regulates the solicitation of insurance and the qualification and licensing of agents and agencies that may desire to conduct business in louisiana 
state insurance department examinations we are subject to periodic examinations by state insurance departments in the states in which we operate 
both louisiana and texas insurance departments generally examine its domiciliary insurance companies on a triennial basis 
american interstate insurance company and silver oak casualty  inc underwent an examination in that covered calendar years through american interstate of texas underwent an examination in that covered calendar year guaranty fund assessments in most of the states where we are licensed to transact business  there is a requirement that property and casualty insurers doing business in that state participate in a guaranty association  which is organized to pay contractual benefits owed under insurance policies issued by impaired  insolvent or failed insurers 
these associations levy assessments  up to prescribed limits  on all member insurers in a particular state on the basis of the proportionate share of the premium written by member insurers in the lines of business in which the impaired  insolvent or failed insurer is engaged 
some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets 
property and casualty insurance company insolvencies or failures may result in additional security fund assessments to us at some future date 
at this time  we are unable to determine the impact  if any  such assessments may have on our financial position or results of operations 
we have established liabilities for guaranty fund assessments with respect to insurers that are currently subject to insolvency proceedings 
residual market programs many of the states in which we conduct business or intend to conduct business  require that all licensed insurers participate in a program to provide workers compensation insurance to those employers who have not or cannot obtain coverage from a carrier on a negotiated basis 
the level of required participation in such programs is generally determined by calculating the volume of our voluntary business in that state as a percentage of all voluntary business in that state by all insurers 
the resulting factor is the proportion of premium we must accept as a percentage of all of premiums in policies included in that state s residual market program 
companies generally can fulfill their residual market obligations by either issuing insurance policies to employers assigned to them  or participating in a reinsurance pool where the results of all policies provided through the pool are shared by the participating companies 
we utilize both methods  depending on management s evaluation of the most cost efficient method to adopt in each state that allows a choice of assigned risk or participation in a pooling arrangement 
in  we had assigned risks in four states alabama  alaska  north carolina and virginia 
second injury funds a number of states operate trust funds that reimburse insurers and employers for claims paid to injured employees for aggravation of prior conditions or injuries 
the state managed trust funds are funded through assessments against insurers and self insurers providing workers compensation coverage in the applicable state 
our recoveries from state managed trust funds for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
our cash paid for assessments to state managed trust funds for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 

table of contents dividend limitations under louisiana law  american interstate and silver oak casualty cannot pay dividends to their shareholders in excess of the lesser of of statutory surplus  or statutory net income  excluding realized investment gains  for the preceding month period without the prior approval of the louisiana commissioner of insurance 
however  net income from the previous two calendar years may be carried forward to the extent that it has not already been paid out as dividends 
further  under texas law  american interstate of texas cannot pay dividends to its shareholder in excess of the greater of of statutory surplus  or statutory net income  for the preceding month period without the prior approval of the texas commissioner of insurance 
federal law and regulations for the year ended december   we derived of our voluntary in force premiums from employers engaged in the maritime industry 
as a provider of workers compensation insurance for employers engaged in the maritime industry  we are subject to the united states longshore and harbor workers compensation act  or the usl h act  and the merchant marine act of  or jones act 
we are also subject to regulations related to the usl h act and the jones act 
the usl h act  which is administered by the us department of labor  generally covers exposures on the navigable waters of the united states and in adjoining waterfront areas  including exposures resulting from stevedoring 
the usl h act requires employers to provide medical benefits  compensation for lost wages  and rehabilitation services to longshoremen  harbor workers and other maritime workers who may suffer injury  disability or death during the course and scope of their employment 
the department of labor has the authority to require us to make deposits to serve as collateral for losses incurred under the usl h act 
the jones act is a federal law  the maritime employer provisions of which provide injured offshore workers  or seamen  with a remedy against their employers for injuries arising from negligent acts of the employer or co workers during the course of employment on a ship or vessel 
privacy regulations in  congress enacted the gramm leach bliley act  which  among other things  protects consumers from the unauthorized dissemination of certain personal information 
subsequently  a majority of states have implemented additional regulations to address privacy issues 
these laws and regulations apply to all financial institutions  including insurance companies  and require us to maintain appropriate policies and procedures for managing and protecting certain personal information of our policyholders and to fully disclose our privacy practices to our policyholders 
we may also be exposed to future privacy laws and regulations  which could impose additional costs and impact our results of operations or financial condition 
in  the national association of insurance commissioners  or the naic  adopted the privacy of consumer financial and health information model regulation  which assisted states in promulgating regulations to comply with the gramm leach bliley act 
in  to further facilitate the implementation of the gramm leach bliley act  the naic adopted the standards for safeguarding customer information model regulation 
several states have now adopted similar provisions regarding the safeguarding of policyholder information 
we have established policies and procedures intended to ensure that we are in compliance with the gramm leach bliley related privacy requirements 
federal and state legislative and regulatory changes from time to time  various regulatory and legislative changes have been proposed in the insurance industry 
among the proposals that have in the past been or are at present being considered are the possible introduction of federal regulation in addition to  or in lieu of  the current system of state regulation of insurers and proposals in various state legislatures some of which proposals have been enacted to conform portions of their insurance 
table of contents laws and regulations to various model acts adopted by the naic 
we are unable to predict whether any of these laws and regulations will be adopted  the form in which any such laws and regulations would be adopted or the effect  if any  these developments would have on our operations and financial condition 
for information on the terrorism risk act  see reinsurance terrorism reinsurance 
the national association of insurance commissioners the naic is a group formed by state insurance commissioners to discuss issues and formulate policy with respect to regulation  reporting and accounting of insurance companies 
although the naic has no legislative authority and insurance companies are at all times subject to the laws of their respective domiciliary states and  to a lesser extent  other states in which they conduct business  the naic is influential in determining the form in which such laws are enacted 
model insurance laws  regulations and guidelines  which we refer to as the model laws  have been promulgated by the naic as a minimum standard by which state regulatory systems and regulations are measured 
adoption of state laws that provide for substantially similar regulations to those described in the model laws is a requirement for accreditation by the naic 
the naic provides authoritative guidance to insurance regulators on statutory accounting issues by promulgating and updating a codified set of statutory accounting practices in its accounting practices and procedures manual 
the louisiana and texas legislatures have adopted these codified statutory accounting practices 
under louisiana law  american interstate and silver oak casualty are each required to maintain minimum capital and surplus of million 
under texas law  american interstate of texas is required to maintain minimum capital and surplus of million 
property and casualty insurance companies are also subject to certain risk based capital requirements by the naic 
under those requirements  the amount of capital and surplus maintained by a property and casualty insurance company is determined based on the various risk factors related to it 
as of december   american interstate  silver oak casualty  and american interstate of texas exceeded the minimum risk based capital requirements 
the key financial ratios of the naic s insurance regulatory information system  or iris  which ratios were developed to assist insurance departments in overseeing the financial condition of insurance companies  are reviewed by experienced financial examiners of the naic and state insurance departments to select those companies that merit highest priority in the allocation of the regulators resources 
iris identifies industry ratios and specifies usual values for each ratio 
departure from the usual values on four or more of the ratios can lead to inquiries from individual state insurance commissioners as to certain aspects of an insurer s business 
the iris results for silver oak casualty and american interstate insurance company of texas were within expected values 
of the ratios  the investment yield ratio for american interstate insurance company was outside the expected range by one tenth of a percent 
this occurred because current low interest rates affected the reinvestment rate for the portfolio 
statutory accounting principles statutory accounting principles  or sap  are a basis of accounting developed to assist insurance regulators in monitoring and regulating the solvency of insurance companies 
sap is primarily concerned with measuring an insurer s surplus as regards to policyholders 
accordingly  statutory accounting focuses on valuing assets and liabilities of insurers at financial reporting dates in accordance with appropriate insurance law and regulatory provisions applicable in each insurer s domiciliary state 
generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  are concerned with a company s solvency  but are also concerned with other financial measurements  principally income and cash flows 
accordingly  gaap gives more consideration to appropriate matching of revenue and expenses and accounting for management s stewardship of assets than does sap 
as a direct result  different assets and liabilities and different amounts of assets and liabilities will be reflected in financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap as compared to sap 

table of contents statutory accounting principles established by the naic and adopted in part by louisiana and texas insurance regulators  determine  among other things  the amount of statutory surplus and statutory net income of american interstate  silver oak casualty and american interstate of texas and thus determine  in part  the amount of funds that are available to pay dividends to amerisafe

table of contents item a 
risk factors 
in evaluating our company  the factors described below should be considered carefully 
the occurrence of one or more of these events could significantly and adversely affect our business  prospects  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
risks related to our business if we do not appropriately establish our premium rates  our results of operations will be adversely affected 
in general  the premium rates for our insurance policies are established when coverage is initiated and  therefore  before all of the underlying costs are known 
like other workers compensation insurance companies  we rely on estimates and assumptions in setting our premium rates 
establishing adequate rates is necessary to generate sufficient revenue to offset losses  loss adjustment expenses and other underwriting expenses  and to earn an underwriting profit 
if we fail to accurately assess the risks that we assume  we may fail to charge adequate premium rates to cover our losses and expenses  which could reduce our net income and cause us to become unprofitable 
for example  when initiating coverage on a policyholder  we estimate future claims expense based  in part  on prior claims information provided by the policyholder s previous insurance carriers 
if this prior claims information is not accurate  we may underprice our policy by using claims estimates that are too low 
as a result  our actual costs for providing insurance coverage to our policyholders may be significantly higher than our premiums 
in order to set premium rates appropriately  we must collect and properly analyze a substantial volume of data  develop  test and apply appropriate rating formulae  closely monitor and timely recognize changes in trends  and project both frequency and severity of losses with reasonable accuracy 
we must also implement our pricing accurately in accordance with our assumptions 
our ability to undertake these efforts successfully  and as a result set premium rates accurately  is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  principally insufficient reliable data  incorrect or incomplete analysis of available data  uncertainties generally inherent in estimates and assumptions  the complexity inherent in implementing appropriate rating formulae or other pricing methodologies  costs of ongoing medical treatment  uncertainties inherent in accurately estimating retention  investment yields  and the duration of our liability for loss and loss adjustment expenses  and unanticipated court decisions  legislation or regulatory action 
consequently  we could set our premium rates too low  which would negatively affect our results of operations and our profitability  or we could set our premium rates too high  which could reduce our competitiveness and lead to lower revenues 
the effects of emerging claims and coverage issues on our business are uncertain 
as industry practices and legal  judicial  social and other environmental conditions change  unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge 
these issues may adversely affect our business by 
table of contents either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims 
in some instances  these changes may not become apparent until after we have issued insurance policies that are affected by the changes 
as a result  the full extent of our liability under an insurance policy may not be known until many years after the policy is issued 
for example  medical costs associated with permanent and partial disabilities may increase more rapidly or be higher than we currently expect 
changes of this nature may expose us to higher claims than we anticipated when we wrote the underlying policy 
the workers compensation insurance industry is cyclical in nature  which may affect our overall financial performance 
the financial performance of the workers compensation insurance industry has historically fluctuated with periods of lower premium rates and excess underwriting capacity resulting from increased competition followed by periods of higher premium rates and reduced underwriting capacity resulting from decreased competition 
although the financial performance of an individual insurance company is dependent on its own specific business characteristics  the profitability of most workers compensation insurance companies generally tends to follow this cyclical market pattern 
in and  the workers compensation industry experienced both decreasing loss costs in most of the states in which we write business and intense price competition 
because this market cyclicality is due in large part to the actions of our competitors and general economic factors  we cannot predict the timing or duration of changes in the market cycle 
we expect these cyclical patterns will cause our revenues and net income to fluctuate  which may cause the price of our common stock to be more volatile 
a decline in the level of business activity of our policyholders  particularly those engaged in the construction  trucking and agricultural industries  could negatively affect our earnings and profitability 
in  of our gross premiums written were derived from policyholders in the construction  trucking and agriculture industries 
because premium rates are calculated  in general  as a percentage of a policyholder s payroll expense  premiums fluctuate depending upon the level of business activity and number of employees of our policyholders 
as a result  our gross premiums written are primarily dependent upon economic conditions in the construction  trucking and agricultural industries and upon economic conditions generally 
we operate in a highly competitive industry and may lack the financial resources to compete effectively 
there is significant competition in the workers compensation insurance industry 
we believe that our competition in the hazardous industries we target is fragmented and not dominated by one or more competitors 
we compete with other insurance companies  state insurance pools and self insurance funds 
many of our existing and potential competitors are significantly larger and possess greater financial  marketing and management resources than we do 
moreover  a number of these competitors offer other types of insurance in addition to workers compensation and can provide insurance nationwide 
we principally offer workers compensation insurance 
we have no current plans to focus our efforts on offering other types of insurance 
as a result  negative developments in the economic  competitive or regulatory conditions affecting the workers compensation insurance industry could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
negative developments in the workers compensation insurance industry could have a greater effect on insurance companies that do not sell multiple types of insurance 
we compete on the basis of many factors  including coverage availability  claims management  safety services  payment terms  premium rates  policy terms  types of insurance offered  overall financial strength  financial ratings and reputation 
if any of our competitors offer premium rates  policy terms or types of insurance that are more competitive than ours  we could lose market share 
no assurance can be given that we will maintain our current competitive position in the markets in which we currently operate or that we will establish a competitive position in new markets into which we may expand 

table of contents our loss reserves are based on estimates and may be inadequate to cover our actual losses 
we record reserves for estimated losses under insurance policies we write and for loss adjustment expenses related to the investigation and settlement of claims 
our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses represent the estimated cost of all reported and unreported loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred and unpaid at any given point in time based on known facts and circumstances 
reserves are based on estimates of the most likely ultimate cost of individual claims 
these estimates are inherently uncertain 
our pre tax income for any period is impacted by establishing reserves for new claims as well as changes in estimates for previously reported losses 
our focus on writing workers compensation insurance for employers engaged in hazardous industries results in our experiencing fewer  but more severe  claims 
the ultimate cost of resolving severe claims is difficult to predict  particularly in the period shortly after the injury occurs 
substantial judgment is required to determine the relevance of our historical experience and industry information under current facts and circumstances 
the interpretation of this historical data can be impacted by external forces  principally frequency and severity of unreported claims  length of time to achieve ultimate settlement of claims  inflation in medical costs and wages  insurance policy coverage interpretations  jury determinations  and legislative changes 
accordingly  our reserves may prove to be inadequate to cover our actual losses 
if there are unfavorable changes affecting our assumptions  our reserves may need to be increased 
when a reserve estimate is increased  the change decreases pre tax income by a corresponding amount 
if we are unable to realize our investment objectives  our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
investment income is an important component of our net income 
as of december   our investment portfolio  including cash and cash equivalents  had a carrying value of million 
for the year ended december  we had million of net investment income 
our investment portfolio is managed under investment guidelines approved by our board of directors  and is made up predominately of fixed maturity securities and cash and cash equivalents 
although our investment guidelines emphasize capital preservation and liquidity  our investments are subject to a variety of risks  including risks related to general economic conditions  interest rate fluctuations  market illiquidity and market volatility 
general economic conditions may be adversely affected by us involvement in hostilities with other countries and large scale acts of terrorism  or the threat of hostilities or terrorist acts 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions 
changes in interest rates could have an adverse effect on the value of our investment portfolio and future investment income 
unprecedented low interest rates experienced in  and have had  and will continue to have  an adverse effect on our investment income 
additionally  changes in interest rates can expose us to prepayment risks on mortgage backed securities included in our investment portfolio 
similarly  during periods of market disruption such as we have experienced since late  including periods of rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity  the fair values of certain of our fixed maturity securities  such as asset backed and commercial mortgage backed securities  could be deemed to be other than temporarily impaired  even though we have the intent not to sell these securities and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities 
further  rapidly changing and unprecedented equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of the equity securities as reported within our consolidated financial statements and the period to period changes in value could vary significantly 
during  we recorded an impairment charge for one asset backed security in our held to maturity investment portfolio 
we impaired this security because  among other things  a loss of principal was anticipated based upon estimated future cash flows 
this charge is included in net realized gains losses on investments on our consolidated statement of income and totaled million for the year ended december  we cannot assure you that our investment portfolio will not suffer additional other than temporary investment losses 

table of contents these and other factors affect the capital markets and  consequently  the value of our investment portfolio and our future investment income 
any significant decline in our investment income would adversely affect our revenues and net income 
current economic conditions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
the economic downturn experienced throughout the united states is expected to continue in negative trends in business investment  consumer confidence and spending  the significant declines and volatility of the capital markets  the availability of credit and the rate of unemployment can adversely affect our business 
a continuation of the economic downturn could further adversely impact our growth and profitability 
although we continue to closely monitor market conditions  we cannot predict future conditions or their impact on our premium volume  the value of our investment portfolio and our financial performance 
as a result of these existing economic conditions  we could experience future decreases in business activity and incur additional realized and unrealized losses in our investment portfolio  both of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  certain actions taken by the us government to stimulate the economy and stabilize the financial markets have directly impacted the property and casualty insurance industry and our competitors 
additional measures in this regard could negatively impact our financial condition and the competitive landscape 
because we are subject to extensive state and federal regulation  legislative changes may negatively impact our business 
we are subject to extensive regulation by the louisiana department of insurance and the insurance regulatory agencies of other states in which we are licensed and  to a lesser extent  federal regulation 
state agencies have broad regulatory powers designed primarily to protect policyholders and their employees  and not our shareholders 
regulations vary from state to state  but typically address standards of solvency  including risk based capital measurements  restrictions on the nature  quality and concentration of our investments  restrictions on the terms of the insurance policies we offer  restrictions on the way our premium rates are established and the premium rates we may charge  required reserves for unearned premiums and loss and loss adjustment expenses  standards for appointing general agencies  limitations on transactions with affiliates  restrictions on mergers and acquisitions  restrictions on the ability of our insurance company subsidiaries to pay dividends to amerisafe  certain required methods of accounting  and potential assessments for state guaranty funds  second injury funds and other mandatory pooling arrangements 
we may be unable to comply fully with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations that are continually undergoing revision 
in addition  we follow practices based on our interpretations of laws and regulations that we believe are generally followed by our industry 
these practices may be different from interpretations of insurance regulatory agencies 
as a result  insurance regulatory agencies could preclude us from conducting some or all of our activities or otherwise penalize us 
for example  in order to enforce 
table of contents applicable laws and regulations or to protect policyholders  insurance regulatory agencies have relatively broad discretion to impose a variety of sanctions  including examinations  corrective orders  suspension  revocation or denial of licenses  and the takeover of one or more of our insurance subsidiaries 
the extensive regulation of our business may increase the cost of our insurance and may limit our ability to obtain premium rate increases or to take other actions to increase our profitability 
we may not be able to recover amounts due from our reinsurers  which would adversely affect our financial condition 
reinsurance does not discharge our obligations under the insurance policies we write 
we remain liable to our policyholders even if we are unable to make recoveries that we are entitled to receive under our reinsurance contracts 
as a result  we are subject to credit risk with respect to our reinsurers 
losses are recovered from our reinsurers as claims are paid 
in long term workers compensation claims  the creditworthiness of our reinsurers may change before we recover amounts to which we are entitled 
therefore  if a reinsurer is unable to meet any of its obligations to us  we would be responsible for all claims and claim settlement expenses for which we would have otherwise received payment from the reinsurer 
as of december   we had million of recoverables from reinsurers 
of this amount  million was unsecured 
as of december   our largest recoverables from reinsurers included million from hannover reinsurance ireland limited  million from aspen insurance limited and million from odyssey america reinsurance company 
if we are unable to collect amounts recoverable from our reinsurers  our financial condition would be adversely impacted 
in the past  we have been unable to recover amounts from our reinsurers 
in  reliance insurance company  one of our former reinsurers  was placed under regulatory supervision by the pennsylvania insurance department and was subsequently placed into liquidation 
as a result  between and december   we recognized losses related to uncollectible amounts due from reliance aggregating million 
our business is dependent on the efforts of our executive officers because of their industry expertise  knowledge of our markets and relationships with the independent agencies that sell our insurance 
our success is dependent on the efforts of our executive officers because of their industry expertise  knowledge of our markets and relationships with our independent agencies 
we have entered into employment agreements with each of our executive officers 
those agreements expire in march except for mr 
gau s agreement which expires june  in each case  unless extended 
should any of our executive officers cease working for us  we may be unable to find acceptable replacements with comparable skills and experience in the workers compensation insurance industry and the hazardous industries that we target 
as a result  our operations may be disrupted and our business may be adversely affected 
we do not currently maintain life insurance policies with respect to our executive officers 
if we cannot sustain our relationships with independent agencies  we may be unable to operate profitably 
we market a substantial portion of our workers compensation insurance through independent agencies 
as of december   independent agencies produced of our voluntary in force premiums 
no independent agency accounted for more than of our voluntary in force premiums at that date 
independent agencies are not obligated to promote our insurance and may sell insurance offered by our competitors 
as a result  our continued profitability depends  in part  on the marketing efforts of our independent agencies and on our ability to offer workers compensation insurance and maintain financial strength ratings that meet the requirements of our independent agencies and their policyholders 

table of contents an inability to effectively manage of our operations could make it difficult for us to compete and could affect our ability to operate profitably 
our continuing strategy includes expanding in our existing markets  entering new geographic markets and further developing our agency relationships 
our strategy is subject to various risks  including risks associated with our ability to profitably increase our business in existing markets  identify profitable new geographic markets for entry  attract and retain qualified personnel for expanded operations  identify  recruit and integrate new independent agencies  and augment our internal operations and systems as we expand our business 
if we are unable to obtain reinsurance on favorable terms  our ability to write policies could be adversely affected 
we purchase reinsurance to protect us from the impact of large losses 
reinsurance is an arrangement in which an insurance company  called the ceding company  transfers insurance risk by sharing premiums with another insurance company  called the reinsurer 
conversely  the reinsurer receives or assumes reinsurance from the ceding company 
our reinsurance program provides us with reinsurance coverage for each loss occurrence up to million  subject to applicable deductibles  retentions and aggregate limits 
however  for any loss occurrence involving only one claimant  our reinsurance coverage is limited to million for any single claimant  subject to applicable deductibles  retentions and aggregate limits 
our program calls for us to retain the first million of each loss 
for losses between million and million  we are subject to an annual aggregate deductible of of subject earned premium before our reinsurers are obligated to reimburse us 
the three year aggregate limit for all claims for losses between million and million is of subject earned premium for part a and of subject earned premium for part b 
for losses between million and million  the three year aggregate limit for all claims for losses between million and million is million 
see business reinsurance 
the availability  amount  and cost of reinsurance are subject to market conditions and our experience with insured losses 
as a result  any material changes in market conditions or our loss experience could adversely affect our financial performance 
if any of our current reinsurers were to terminate participation in our reinsurance treaty program  we could be exposed to an increased risk of loss 
the reinsurance treaty program s first casualty excess of loss layers will terminate on january  the second casualty excess of loss and casualty catastrophe layers will terminate on january  when our reinsurance treaty program is terminated and we enter into a new program  any decrease in the amount of reinsurance at the time we enter into a new program  whether caused by the existence of more restrictive terms and conditions or decreased availability  will also increase our risk of loss and  as a result  could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we currently have reinsurers participating in our reinsurance treaty program  and we believe that this is a sufficient number of reinsurers to provide us with the reinsurance coverage we require 
however  it is possible that one or more of our current reinsurers could terminate participation in our program 
regarding the first casualty excess of loss treaty  it is possible that one or more of our current reinsurers could terminate continued participation in this loss layer 
in addition  we may terminate the participation of one or more of our reinsurers under certain circumstances as permitted by the terms of our reinsurance agreements 
in any of these events  if our reinsurance broker is unable to reallocate the terminated reinsurance among the remaining reinsurers in the program  it could take a significant period of time to identify and negotiate agreements with one or more replacement reinsurers 
during this period  we would be exposed to an increased risk of loss  the extent of which would depend on the coverage previously provided by the terminated reinsurance 

table of contents a downgrade in our am best rating would likely reduce the amount of business we are able to write 
rating agencies evaluate insurance companies based on their ability to pay claims 
we are currently assigned a group letter rating of a excellent from am best  which is the rating agency that we believe has the most influence on our business 
this rating is assigned to companies that  in the opinion of am best  have demonstrated an excellent overall performance when compared to industry standards 
am best considers a rated companies to have an excellent ability to meet their ongoing obligations to policyholders 
the ratings of am best are subject to periodic review using  among other things  proprietary capital adequacy models  and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time 
am best ratings are directed toward the concerns of policyholders and insurance agencies and are not intended for the protection of investors or as a recommendation to buy  hold or sell securities 
our competitive position relative to other companies is determined in part by our am best rating 
any downgrade in our rating would likely adversely affect our business through the loss of certain existing and potential policyholders and the loss of relationships with certain independent agencies 
a downgrade in the am best rating of one or more of our significant reinsurers could adversely affect our financial condition 
our financial condition could be adversely affected if the am best rating of one or more of our significant reinsurers is downgraded 
for example  our am best rating may be downgraded if our amounts recoverable from a reinsurer are significant and the am best rating of that reinsurer is downgraded 
if one of our reinsurers suffers a rating downgrade  we may consider various options to lessen the impact on our financial condition  including commutation  novation and the use of letters of credit to secure amounts recoverable from reinsurers 
however  these options may result in losses to our company  and there can be no assurance that we could implement any of these options 
we may require additional capital in the future  which may not be available to us or may be available only on unfavorable terms 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including state regulatory requirements  the financial stability of our reinsurers and our ability to write new business and establish premium rates sufficient to cover our estimated claims 
we may need to raise additional capital or curtail our growth if the capital of our insurance subsidiaries is insufficient to support future operating requirements and or cover claims 
if we had to raise additional capital  equity or debt financing might not be available to us or might be available only on terms that are not favorable 
future equity offerings could be dilutive to our shareholders and the equity securities issued in any offering may have rights  preferences and privileges senior to our common stock 
if we cannot obtain adequate capital on favorable terms or at all  we may be unable to support future growth or operating requirements and  as a result  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 
as an insurance holding company  amerisafe is dependent on the results of operations of its insurance subsidiaries  and our company s ability to pay dividends depends on the regulatory and financial capacity of its subsidiaries to pay dividends to amerisafe 
amerisafe is a holding company that transacts business through its operating subsidiaries  including american interstate insurance company 
amerisafe s primary assets are the capital stock of these operating subsidiaries 
the ability of amerisafe to pay dividends to our shareholders depends upon the surplus and earnings of our subsidiaries and their ability to pay dividends to amerisafe 
payment of dividends by our insurance subsidiaries is restricted by state insurance laws  including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds  and could be subject to contractual restrictions in the future  including those imposed by indebtedness we may incur in the future 
as a result  amerisafe may not be able to receive dividends from its insurance subsidiaries and may not receive dividends in amounts necessary to pay dividends on our capital stock 

table of contents assessments and premium surcharges for state guaranty funds  second injury funds and other mandatory pooling arrangements may reduce our profitability 
most states require insurance companies licensed to do business in their state to participate in guaranty funds  which require the insurance companies to bear a portion of the unfunded obligations of impaired  insolvent or failed insurance companies 
these obligations are funded by assessments  most of which are expected to continue in the future 
state guaranty associations levy assessments  up to prescribed limits  on all member insurance companies in the state based on their proportionate share of premiums written in the lines of business in which the impaired  insolvent or failed insurance companies are engaged 
see business regulation in item of this report 
accordingly  the assessments levied on us may increase as we increase our written premium 
some states also have laws that establish second injury funds to reimburse insurers and employers for claims paid to injured employees for aggravation of prior conditions or injuries 
these funds are supported by either assessments or premium surcharges based on case incurred losses 
in addition  as a condition to conducting business in some states  insurance companies are required to participate in residual market programs to provide insurance to those employers who cannot procure coverage from an insurance carrier on a negotiated basis 
insurance companies generally can fulfill their residual market obligations by  among other things  participating in a reinsurance pool where the results of all policies provided through the pool are shared by the participating insurance companies 
although we price our insurance to account for obligations we may have under these pooling arrangements  we may not be successful in estimating our liability for these obligations 
accordingly  mandatory pooling arrangements may cause a decrease in our profits 
at december   we participated in mandatory pooling arrangements in states and the district of columbia 
as we write policies in new states that have mandatory pooling arrangements  we will be required to participate in additional pooling arrangements 
further  the impairment  insolvency or failure of other insurance companies in these pooling arrangements would likely increase the liability for other members in the pool 
the effect of assessments and premium surcharges or changes in them could reduce our profitability in any given period or limit our ability to grow our business 
we may have exposure to losses from terrorism for which we are required by law to provide coverage 
when writing workers compensation insurance policies  we are required by law to provide workers compensation benefits for losses arising from acts of terrorism 
the impact of any terrorist act is unpredictable  and the ultimate impact on us would depend upon the nature  extent  location and timing of such an act 
our reinsurance treaty program affords limited coverage for up to million for losses arising from terrorism  subject to applicable deductibles  retentions and aggregate limits 
notwithstanding the protection provided by reinsurance and the terrorism risk insurance extension act of  the risk of severe losses to us from acts of terrorism has not been eliminated because our reinsurance treaty program includes various sub limits and exclusions limiting our reinsurers obligation to cover losses caused by acts of terrorism 
accordingly  events constituting acts of terrorism may not be covered by  or may exceed the capacity of  our reinsurance and could adversely affect our business and financial condition 
in addition  the terrorism risk insurance extension act of is set to expire on december  if this law is not extended or replaced by legislation affording a similar level of protection to the insurance industry against insured losses arising out of acts of terrorism  reinsurance for losses arising from terrorism may be unavailable or prohibitively expensive  and we may be further exposed to losses arising from acts of terrorism 

table of contents risks related to our common stock our revenues and results of operations may fluctuate as a result of factors beyond our control  which fluctuation may cause the price of our common stock to be volatile 
the revenues and results of operations of our insurance subsidiaries historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties 
our profitability can be affected significantly by rising levels of claims costs  including medical and prescription drug costs  that we cannot anticipate at the time we establish our premium rates  fluctuations in interest rates  inflationary or deflationary pressures and other changes in the investment environment that affect returns on our invested assets  changes in the frequency or severity of claims  the financial stability of our reinsurers and changes in the level of reinsurance capacity and our capital capacity  new types of claims and new or changing judicial interpretations relating to the scope of liabilities of insurance companies  volatile and unpredictable developments  including man made  weather related and other natural catastrophes or terrorist attacks  and price competition 
if our revenues and results of operations fluctuate as a result of one or more of these factors  the price of our common stock may become more volatile 
the trading price of our common stock may decline 
the trading price of our common stock may decline for many reasons  some of which are beyond our control  including  among others our results of operations  changes in expectations as to our future results of operations  including financial estimates and projections by securities analysts and investors  results of operations that vary from those expected by securities analysts and investors  developments in the healthcare or insurance industries  current and expected economic conditions  changes in laws and regulations  announcements of claims against us by third parties  and future issuances or sales of our common stock 
in addition  the stock market experiences significant volatility from time to time that is often unrelated to the operating performance of companies whose shares are traded 
these market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
securities analysts may discontinue coverage of our common stock or may issue negative reports  which may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
there is no assurance that securities analysts will continue to cover our company 
if securities analysts do not cover our company  this lack of coverage may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock

these factors could cause our actual results in and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in  or implied by  those forward looking statements 
overview amerisafe is a holding company that markets and underwrites workers compensation insurance through its insurance subsidiaries 
workers compensation insurance covers statutorily prescribed benefits that employers are obligated to provide to their employees who are injured in the course and scope of their employment 
our business strategy is focused on providing this coverage to small to mid sized employers engaged in hazardous industries  principally construction  trucking and agriculture 
employers engaged in hazardous industries pay substantially higher than average rates for workers compensation insurance compared to employers in other industries  as measured per payroll dollar 
the higher premium rates are due to the nature of the work performed and the inherent workplace danger of our target employers 
hazardous industry employers also tend to have less frequent but more severe claims as compared to employers in other industries due to the nature of their businesses 
we provide proactive safety reviews of employers workplaces 
these safety reviews are a vital component of our underwriting process and also promote safer workplaces 
we utilize intensive claims management practices that we believe permit us to reduce the overall cost of our claims 
in addition  our audit services ensure that our policyholders pay the appropriate premiums required under the terms of their policies and enable us to monitor payroll patterns that cause underwriting  safety or fraud concerns 
we believe that the higher premiums typically paid by our policyholders  together with our disciplined underwriting and safety  claims and audit services  provide us with the opportunity to earn attractive returns for our shareholders 
we actively market our insurance in states and the district of columbia through independent agencies  as well as through our wholly owned insurance agency subsidiary 
we are also licensed in an additional states and the us virgin islands 
two of the key financial measures that we use to evaluate our performance are return on average equity and growth in book value per share 
we calculate return on average equity by dividing annual net income by the average of annual shareholders equity 
our return on average equity was in  in and in we calculate book value per share by dividing ending shareholder s equity by number of common shares outstanding 
our book value per share was at december   at december  and at december  investment income is an important element of our net income 
because the period of time between our receipt of premiums and the ultimate settlement of claims is often several years or longer  we are able to invest cash from premiums for significant periods of time 
as a result  we are able to generate more investment income from our premiums as compared to insurance companies that operate in other lines of business that pay claims more quickly 
from december  to december   our investment portfolio  including cash and cash equivalents  increased from million to million and produced net investment income of million in  million in and million in the use of reinsurance is an important component of our business strategy 
we purchase reinsurance to protect us from the impact of large losses 
our reinsurance program for includes reinsurers that provide coverage to us in excess of a certain specified loss amount  or retention level 
our reinsurance program provides us with reinsurance coverage for each loss occurrence up to million  subject to applicable deductibles  retentions and aggregate limits 
however  for any loss occurrence involving only one claimant  our reinsurance coverage is limited to million for any single claimant  subject to applicable deductibles  
table of contents retentions and aggregate limits 
our program was substantially similar to our program which calls for us to retain the first million of each loss 
for losses between million and million  we are subject to an annual aggregate deductible of of subject earned premium before our reinsurers are obligated to reimburse us 
the aggregate limit for all claims for losses between million and million has two parts  as fully described in business reinsurance in item of this report 
for losses between million and million  the three year aggregate limit is million 
as losses are incurred and recorded  we record amounts recoverable from reinsurers for the portion of the losses ceded to our reinsurers 
our most significant balance sheet liability is our reserve for loss and loss adjustment expenses 
we record reserves for estimated losses under insurance policies that we write and for loss adjustment expenses related to the investigation and settlement of claims 
our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses represent the estimated cost of all reported and unreported loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred and unpaid at any given point in time based on known facts and circumstances 
reserves are based on estimates of the most likely ultimate cost of individual claims 
these estimates are inherently uncertain 
in addition  there are no policy limits on the liability for workers compensation claims as there are for other forms of insurance 
therefore  estimating reserves for workers compensation claims may be more uncertain than estimating reserves for other types of insurance claims with shorter or more definite periods between occurrence of the claim and final determination of the loss and with policy limits on liability for claim amounts 
our focus on providing workers compensation insurance to employers engaged in hazardous industries results in our receiving relatively fewer but more severe claims than many other workers compensation insurance companies 
severe claims  which we define as claims having an estimated ultimate cost of more than million  usually have a material effect on each accident year s loss reserves and our reported results of operations as a result of both the number of severe claims reported in any year and the timing of claims in the year 
as a result of our focus on higher severity  lower frequency business  our reserve for loss and loss adjustment expenses may have greater volatility than other workers compensation insurance companies 
for example  for the five year period ended december  we had recorded severe claims  or an average of severe claims per year for accident years through the number of severe claims reported in any one accident year as of december  ranged from a low of in to a high of in the average reported severity for these claims ranged from million for the accident year to million for the accident year 
for the five accident years  these severe claims accounted for an average of percentage points of our overall loss and loss adjustment expense  or lae  ratio  measured at december  further  the ultimate cost of severe claims is more difficult to estimate  principally due to uncertainties as to medical treatment and outcome and the length and degree of disability 
because of these uncertainties  the estimate of the ultimate cost of severe claims can vary significantly as more information becomes available 
as a result  at year end  the case reserve for a severe claim reported early in the year may be more accurate than the case reserve established for a severe claim reported late in the year 
a key assumption used by management in establishing loss reserves is that average per claim case incurred loss and loss adjustment expenses will increase year over year 
we believe this increase primarily reflects medical and wage inflation and utilization 
however  changes in per average claim case incurred loss and loss adjustment expenses can also be affected by frequency of severe claims in the applicable accident years 
as more fully described in business loss reserves in item of this report  the estimate for loss and loss adjustment expenses is established based upon management s analysis of historical data  and factors and trends derived from that data  including claims reported  average claim amount incurred  case development  duration  severity and payment patterns  as well as subjective assumptions 
this analysis includes reviews of case reserves for individual open severe claims in the current and prior years 
management reviews the outcomes from actuarial analyses to confirm the reasonableness of its reserve estimate 

table of contents substantial judgment is required to determine the relevance of our historical experience and industry information under current facts and circumstances 
the interpretation of this historical and industry data can be impacted by external forces  principally frequency and severity of unreported claims  length of time to achieve ultimate settlement of claims  utilization  inflation in medical costs and wages  insurance policy coverage interpretations  jury determinations and legislative changes 
accordingly  our reserves may prove to be inadequate to cover our actual losses 
if we change our estimates  these changes would be reflected in our results of operations during the period in which they are made  with increases in our reserves resulting in decreases in our earnings 
our gross reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses at december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
as a percentage of gross reserves at year end  ibnr represented in  in and in in  we decreased our estimates for prior year loss reserves by million

in  we decreased our estimates for prior year loss reserves by million 
the workers compensation insurance industry is cyclical in nature and influenced by many factors  including price competition  medical cost increases  natural and man made disasters  changes in interest rates  changes in state laws and regulations  and general economic conditions 
a hard market in our industry is characterized by decreased competition that results in higher premium rates  more restrictive policy coverage terms  and lower commissions paid to agencies 
in contrast  a soft market is characterized by increased competition that results in lower premium rates  expanded policy coverage terms  and higher commissions paid to agencies 
we believe that the workers compensation insurance industry is transitioning from a soft market cycle 
our strategy is to focus on maintaining underwriting profitability 
for additional information regarding our loss reserves and the analyses and methodologies used by management to establish these reserves  see the information under the caption business loss reserves in item of this report 
principal revenue and expense items our revenues consist primarily of the following net premiums earned 
net premiums earned is the earned portion of our net premiums written 
net premiums written is equal to gross premiums written less premiums ceded to reinsurers 
gross premiums written includes the estimated annual premiums from each insurance policy we write in our voluntary and assigned risk businesses during a reporting period based on the policy effective date or the date the policy is bound  whichever is later 
premiums are earned on a daily pro rata basis over the term of the policy 
at the end of each reporting period  premiums written that are not earned are classified as unearned premiums and are earned in subsequent periods over the remaining term of the policy 
our insurance policies typically have a term of one year 
thus  for a one year policy written on july  for an employer with constant payroll during the term of the policy  we would earn half of the premiums in and the other half in on a monthly basis  we also recognize net premiums earned from mandatory pooling arrangements 
we estimate the annual premiums to be paid by our policyholders when we issue the policies and record those amounts on our balance sheet as premiums receivable 
we conduct premium audits on all of our voluntary business policyholders annually  upon the expiration of each policy  including when the policy is renewed 
the purpose of these audits is to verify that policyholders have accurately reported their payroll expenses and employee job classifications  and therefore have paid us the premium required under the terms of the policies 

table of contents the difference between the estimated premium and the ultimate premium is referred to as earned but unbilled premium  or ebub premium 
ebub premium can be higher or lower than the estimated premium 
ebub premium is subject to significant variability and can either increase or decrease earned premium based upon several factors  including changes in premium growth  industry mix and economic conditions 
due to the timing of audits and other adjustments  the ultimate premium earned is generally not determined for several months after the expiration of the policy 
we review the estimate of ebub premiums on a quarterly basis using historical data and applying various assumptions based on the current market  and we record an adjustment to premium  related losses  and expenses as warranted 
net investment income and net realized gains and losses on investments 
we invest our statutory surplus funds and the funds supporting our insurance liabilities in fixed maturity and equity securities 
in addition  a portion of these funds are held in cash and cash equivalents to pay current claims 
our net investment income includes interest and dividends earned on our invested assets  and amortization of premiums and discounts on our fixed maturity securities 
we assess the performance of our investment portfolio using a standard tax equivalent yield metric 
investment income that is tax exempt is increased by our marginal federal tax rate of to express yield on tax exempt securities on the same basis as taxable securities 
net realized gains and losses on our investments are reported separately from our net investment income 
net realized gains occur when our investment securities are sold for more than their costs or amortized costs  as applicable 
net realized losses occur when our investment securities are sold for less than their costs or amortized costs  as applicable  or are written down as a result of other than temporary impairment 
we classify the majority of our fixed maturity securities as held to maturity 
we also have some fixed maturity securities classified as available for sale  as are our equity securities 
net unrealized gains or losses on our securities classified as available for sale are reported separately within accumulated other comprehensive income on our balance sheet 
fee and other income 
we recognize commission income earned on policies issued by other carriers that are sold by our wholly owned insurance agency subsidiary as the related services are performed 
we also recognize a small portion of interest income from mandatory pooling arrangements in which we participate 
our expenses consist primarily of the following loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred 
loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred represents our largest expense item and  for any given reporting period  includes estimates of future claim payments  changes in those estimates from prior reporting periods and costs associated with investigating  defending  and administering claims 
these expenses fluctuate based on the amount and types of risks we insure 
we record loss and loss adjustment expenses related to estimates of future claim payments based on case by case valuations and statistical analyses 
we seek to establish all reserves at the most likely ultimate exposure based on our historical claims experience 
it is typical for our more serious claims to take several years to settle and we revise our estimates as we receive additional information about the condition of the injured employees 
our ability to estimate loss and loss adjustment expenses accurately at the time of pricing our insurance policies is a critical factor in our profitability 
underwriting and certain other operating costs 
underwriting and certain other operating costs are those expenses that we incur to underwrite and maintain the insurance policies we issue 
these expenses include state and local premium taxes and fees and other operating costs  offset by commissions we receive from reinsurers under our reinsurance treaty programs 
we pay state and local taxes  licenses and fees  assessments  and contributions to state workers compensation security funds based on premiums 
in addition  other operating costs include general and administrative expenses  excluding commissions and salaries and benefits  incurred at both the insurance company and corporate level 
commissions 
we pay commissions to our subsidiary insurance agency and to the independent agencies that sell our insurance based on premiums collected from policyholders 

table of contents salaries and benefits 
we pay salaries and provide benefits to our employees 
policyholder dividends 
in limited circumstances  we pay dividends to policyholders in particular states as an underwriting incentive 
additionally  florida law requires payment of dividends to florida policyholders pursuant to a formula based on underwriting results from policies written in florida over a consecutive three year period 
interest expense 
interest expense represents amounts we incur on our outstanding indebtedness at the then applicable interest rate 
income tax expense 
we incur federal  state  and local income tax expense 
critical accounting policies understanding our accounting policies is key to understanding our financial statements 
management considers some of these policies to be very important to the presentation of our financial results because they require us to make significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures 
some of the estimates result from judgments that can be subjective and complex and  consequently  actual results in future periods might differ from these estimates 
management believes that the most critical accounting policies relate to the reporting of reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses  including losses that have occurred but have not been reported prior to the reporting date  amounts recoverable from reinsurers  assessments  deferred policy acquisition costs  deferred income taxes  the impairment of investment securities and share based compensation 
the following is a description of our critical accounting policies 
reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses 
we record reserves for estimated losses under insurance policies that we write and for loss adjustment expenses  which include defense and cost containment  or dcc  and adjusting and other  or ao  expenses  related to the investigation and settlement of policy claims 
our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses represent the estimated cost of all reported and unreported loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred and unpaid at any given point in time based on known facts and circumstances 
our reserves for loss and dcc expenses are estimated using case by case valuations based on our estimate of the most likely outcome of the claim at that time 
in addition to these case reserves  we establish reserves on an aggregate basis that have been incurred but not reported  or ibnr 
our ibnr reserves are also intended to provide for aggregate changes in case incurred amounts as well as for recently reported claims which an initial case reserve has not been established 
the third component of our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses is our ao reserve 
our ao reserve is established for those future claims administration costs that cannot be allocated directly to individual claims 
the final component of our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses is the reserve for mandatory pooling arrangements 
in establishing our reserves  we review the results of analyses using actuarial methods that utilize historical loss data from our more than years of underwriting workers compensation insurance 
the actuarial analysis of our historical data provides the factors we use in estimating our loss reserves 
these factors are primarily measures over time of the number of claims paid and reported  average paid and incurred claim amounts  claim closure rates and claim payment patterns 
in evaluating the results of our analyses  management also uses substantial judgment in considering other factors that are not considered in these actuarial analyses  including changes in business mix  claims management  regulatory issues  medical trends  employment and wage patterns  insurance policy coverage interpretations  judicial determinations and other subjective factors 
due to the 
table of contents inherent uncertainty associated with these estimates  and the cost of incurred but unreported claims  our actual liabilities may vary significantly from our original estimates 
on a quarterly basis  we review our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses to determine whether adjustments are required 
any resulting adjustments are included in the results for the current period 
in establishing our reserves  we do not use loss discounting  which would involve recognizing the time value of money and offsetting estimates of future payments by future expected investment income 
additional information regarding our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses and the actuarial method and other factors used in establishing these reserves can be found under the caption business loss reserves in item of this report 
amounts recoverable from reinsurers 
amounts recoverable from reinsurers represent the portion of our paid and unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses that are assumed by reinsurers and related commissions due from reinsurers 
these amounts are separately reported on our balance sheet as assets and do not reduce our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses because reinsurance does not relieve us of liability to our policyholders 
we are required to pay claims even if a reinsurer fails to pay us under the terms of a reinsurance contract 
we calculate amounts recoverable from reinsurers based on our estimates of the underlying loss and loss adjustment expenses  as well as the terms and conditions of our reinsurance contracts  which could be subject to interpretation 
in addition  we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers  which can be significant because some of the unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses for which we have reinsurance coverage remain outstanding for extended periods of time 
premiums receivable 
premiums receivable represents premium related balances due from our policyholders based on annual premiums for policies written  including surcharges and deposits and it is adjusted for premium audits  endorsements  cancellations  cash transactions and charge offs 
the balance is shown net of the allowance for doubtful accounts and it includes an estimate for ebub 
the ebub estimate is subject to significant variability and can either increase or decrease premiums receivable and earned premiums based upon several factors  including changes in premium growth  industry mix and economic conditions 
assessments 
we are subject to various assessments and premium surcharges related to our insurance activities  including assessments and premium surcharges for state guaranty funds and second injury funds 
assessments based on premiums are recorded as an expense as premiums are earned and generally paid one year after the calendar year in which the policies are written 
assessments based on losses are recorded as an expense as losses are incurred and are generally paid within one year of when claims are paid by us 
state guaranty fund assessments are used by state insurance oversight agencies to pay claims of policyholders of impaired  insolvent or failed insurance companies and the operating expenses of those agencies 
second injury funds are used by states to reimburse insurers and employers for claims paid to injured employees for aggravation of prior conditions or injuries 
in some states  these assessments and premium surcharges may be partially recovered through a reduction in future premium taxes 
deferred policy acquisition costs 
we defer commission expenses  premium taxes and certain marketing  sales  underwriting and safety costs that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of insurance policies 
these acquisition costs are capitalized and charged to expense ratably as premiums are earned 
in calculating deferred policy acquisition costs  these costs are limited to their estimated realizable value  which gives effect to the premiums to be earned  anticipated losses and settlement expenses and certain other costs we expect to incur as the premiums are earned  less related net investment income 
judgments as to the ultimate recoverability of these deferred policy acquisition costs are highly dependent upon estimated future profitability of unearned premiums 
if the unearned premiums were less than our expected claims and expenses after considering investment income  we would reduce the deferred costs 
deferred income taxes 
we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributed to differences 
table of contents between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from a tax rate change impacts our net income or loss in the reporting period that includes the enactment date of the tax rate change 
in assessing whether our deferred tax assets will be realized  management considers whether it is more likely than not that we will generate future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income in making this assessment 
if necessary  we establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
impairment of investment securities 
impairment of an investment security results in a reduction of the carrying value of the security and the realization of a loss when the fair value of the security declines below our cost or amortized cost  as applicable  for the security  and the impairment is deemed to be other than temporary 
we regularly review our investment portfolio to evaluate the necessity of recording impairment losses for other than temporary declines in the fair value of specific investments 
we consider various factors in determining if a decline in the fair value of an individual security is other than temporary 
some of the factors we consider include any reduction or elimination of preferred stock dividends  or nonpayment of scheduled principal or interest payments  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer of the applicable security  including any specific events that may affect its operations or earnings  how long and by how much the fair value of the security has been below its cost or amortized cost  any downgrades of the security by a rating agency  our intent not to sell the security for a sufficient time period for it to recover its value  the likelihood of being forced to sell the security before the recovery of its value  and an evaluation as to whether there are any credit losses on debt securities 
share based compensation 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  compensation stock compensation  we recognize compensation costs for stock option awards over the applicable vesting periods

table of contents the table below sets forth the number of open claims as of december   and  and the numbers of claims reported and closed during the years then ended 
twelve months ended december  open claims at beginning of period claims reported claims closed open claims at end of period at december   our incurred amounts for certain accident years  particularly  and  have not developed to the degree management previously expected 
the assumptions we used in establishing our reserves for these accident years were based on our historical claims data 
however  as of december   actual results for these accident years have been better than our assumptions would have predicted 
at the same time  actual results for accident year are higher than we predicted 
we do not presently intend to modify our assumptions for establishing reserves in light of recent results 
however  if actual results for current and future accident years are consistent with  or different than  our results in these recent accident years  our historical claims data will reflect this change and  over time  will impact the reserves we establish for future claims 
our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses are inherently uncertain and our focus on providing workers compensation insurance to employers engaged in hazardous industries results in our receiving relatively fewer but more severe claims than many other workers compensation insurance companies 
as a result of this focus on higher severity  lower frequency business  our reserve for loss and loss adjustment expenses may have greater volatility than other workers compensation insurance companies 
for additional information  see business loss reserves 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of operating funds are premiums  investment income  and proceeds from maturities of investments 
our primary uses of operating funds include payments for claims and operating expenses 
we pay claims and operating expenses using cash flow from operations and invest our excess cash in fixed maturity and equity securities 
we presently expect that our projected cash flow from operations will provide us sufficient liquidity to fund future operations  including payment of claims and operating expenses  payment of interest on our subordinated notes and other holding company expenses  for at least the next months 
we forecast claim payments based on our historical trends 
we seek to manage the funding of claim payments by actively managing available cash and forecasting cash flows on a short and long term basis 
cash payments  net of reinsurance  for claims were million in  million in and million in we fund claim payments out of cash flow from operations  principally premiums  net of amounts ceded to our reinsurers  and net investment income 
our investment portfolio has increased from million at december  to million at december  as discussed above under overview  we purchase reinsurance to protect us against severe claims and catastrophic events 
based on our estimates of future claims  we believe we are sufficiently capitalized to satisfy the deductibles and retentions in our reinsurance program 
we reevaluate our reinsurance program at least annually  taking into consideration a number of factors  including cost of reinsurance  our liquidity requirements  operating leverage and coverage terms 
even if we maintain our existing retention levels  if the cost of reinsurance increases  our cash flow from operations would decrease as we would cede a greater portion of our written premiums to our reinsurers 
conversely  our cash flow from operations would increase if the cost of reinsurance declined relative to our retention

amerisafe is a holding company that transacts business through its operating subsidiaries  including american interstate  silver oak casualty and american interstate of texas 
amerisafe s primary assets are the capital stock of these insurance subsidiaries 
the ability of amerisafe to fund its operations depends upon the surplus and earnings of its subsidiaries and their ability to pay dividends to amerisafe 
payment of dividends by our insurance subsidiaries is restricted by state insurance laws  including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds 
based upon the prescribed calculation  the insurance subsidiaries could pay to amerisafe dividends of up to million after march of without seeking regulatory approval 
see business regulation dividend limitations in item of this report 
in march  we commuted certain reinsurance agreements with lincoln national life insurance company  connecticut general life insurance and phoenix life insurance company covering portions of the accident year 
we received cash of million in exchange for releasing lincoln national  connecticut general and phoenix life from their reinsurance obligations under the commuted agreements 
as a result of the commutation  we recorded additional pre tax income of approximately million in the first quarter of lincoln national remains obligated to subsidiaries of the company under other reinsurance agreements 
investment portfolio the principal objectives of our investment portfolio are to preserve capital and surplus and to maintain appropriate liquidity for corporate requirements 
additional objectives are to support our am best rating and to maximize after tax income and total return 
we presently expect to maintain sufficient liquidity from funds generated by operations to meet our anticipated insurance obligations and operating and capital expenditure needs 
excess funds from operations will be invested in accordance with our investment policy and statutory requirements 
we allocate our portfolio into four categories cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  fixed maturity securities and equity securities 
cash and cash equivalents include cash on deposit  money market funds and municipal securities  corporate securities and certificates of deposit with an original maturity of less than days 
short term investments include municipal securities  corporate securities and certificates of deposit with an original maturity greater than days but less than one year 
our fixed maturity securities include obligations of the us treasury or us agencies  obligations of states and their subdivisions  long term certificates of deposit  us dollar denominated obligations of the us or canadian corporations  us agency based mortgage backed securities  commercial mortgage backed securities and asset backed securities 
under louisiana and texas law  as applicable  each of american interstate  silver oak casualty and american interstate of texas is required to invest only in securities that are either interest bearing  interest accruing or eligible for dividends  and must limit its investment in the securities of any single issuer to five percent of the insurance company s assets 
as of december   we were in compliance with these requirements 
we employ diversification policies and balance investment credit risk and related underwriting risks to minimize our total potential exposure to any one business sector or security 
as of december   our investment portfolio  including cash and cash equivalents  totaled million  an increase of from december  the majority of our fixed maturity securities are classified as held to maturity  as defined by fasb asc topic  investments debt and equity securities 
as such  the 
table of contents reported value of those securities is equal to their amortized cost  and is not impacted by changing interest rates 
the remainder of our fixed maturity securities and all of equity securities are classified as available for sale and reported at fair value 
on january   we adopted fasb asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  which defines fair value  establishes a fair value hierarchy and requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 
as disclosed in note of the financial statements  our securities available for sale are classified using level and inputs 
we did not elect the fair value option prescribed under fasb asc topic  financial instruments  for any financial assets or financial liabilities in or the composition of our investment portfolio  including cash and cash equivalents  as of december  is shown in the following table

as of that date  unrealized gains and losses are recorded against accumulated other comprehensive income loss  except when such securities are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired 
for our securities classified as held to maturity  unrealized gains and losses are not recorded in the financial statements until realized or until a decline in fair value  below amortized cost  is deemed to be other than temporary 
we regularly review our investment portfolio to evaluate the necessity of recording impairment losses for other than temporary declines in the fair value of our investments 
we consider various factors in determining if a decline in the fair value of an individual security is other than temporary 
the key factors we consider are any reduction or elimination of preferred stock dividends  or nonpayment of scheduled principal or interest payments  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer of the applicable security  including any specific events that may affect its operations or earnings  
table of contents how long and by how much the fair value of the security has been below its cost or amortized cost  any downgrades of the security by a rating agency  our intent not to sell the security for a sufficient time period for it to recover its value  the likelihood of being forced to sell the security before the recovery of its value  and an evaluation as to whether there are any credit losses on debt securities 
the following table summarizes the fair value of  and the amount of unrealized losses on  our investment securities  segregated by the time period each security has been in a continuous unrealized loss position as of december  and less than twelve months twelve months or longer fair value unrealized losses fair value unrealized losses in thousands december  fixed maturity securities equity securities december  fixed maturity securities equity securities we reviewed all securities with unrealized losses in accordance with the impairment policy described above 
we determined that the unrealized losses in the fixed maturity securities portfolio related primarily to changes in market interest rates since the date of purchase  current conditions in the capital markets and the impact of those conditions on market liquidity and prices generally  and the transfer of the investments from the available for sale classification to the held to maturity classification in january we expect to recover the carrying value of these securities as it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis 
in addition  none of the unrealized losses on debt securities are considered credit losses 
in  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to one asset backed security in our held to maturity investment portfolio 
we impaired this security because  among other things  a loss of principal was anticipated based upon estimated future cash flows 
the impairment charge is included in net realized gains losses on investments for in  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to one equity security 
the impairment charge is included in net realized gains losses on investments for we also sold certain equity securities classified as available for sale for which an other than temporary impairment had previously been recognized 
the realized gain of million on these previously impaired securities is included in net realized gains losses on investments for there were no impairment charges recorded in in order to recapture realized capital gains for income tax purposes  we sold certain equity securities and one fixed maturity security which was classified as held to maturity 
these particular securities had been impaired in the held to maturity security was eligible for sale because the security had been downgraded below investment grade 
with limited securities classified as available for sale  the sale of this fixed maturity security was needed to maximize our carryback potential 
the realized gain of million on the sale of these previously impaired securities is included in net realized gains losses on investments for the pre tax investment yield on our investment portfolio was per annum during the twelve months ended december   compared to per annum during the same period in 
table of contents contractual obligations and commitments we manage risk on certain long duration claims by settling these claims through the purchase of annuities from unaffiliated life insurance companies 
in the event these companies are unable to meet their obligations under these annuity contracts  we could be liable to the claimants  but our reinsurers remain obligated to indemnify us for all or part of these obligations in accordance with the terms of our reinsurance contracts 
as of december   the present value of these annuities was million  as estimated by our annuity providers 
substantially all of the annuities are issued or guaranteed by life insurance companies that have an am best rating of a excellent or better 
for additional information  see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
we lease equipment and office space under noncancelable operating leases 
future minimum lease payments at december   were as follows year future minimum lease payments in thousands rental expense was million in  million in and million in the table below provides information with respect to our long term debt and contractual commitments as of december  contractual obligations payment due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands subordinated notes loss and loss adjustment expenses loss based insurance assessments capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total amounts do not include interest payments associated with these obligations 
interest rates on our subordinated notes are variable and may change on a quarterly basis 
see liquidity and capital resources above for further discussion of our subordinated notes 
the loss and loss adjustment expense payments due by period in the table above are based upon the loss and loss adjustment expense estimates as of december  and actuarial estimates of expected payout patterns and are not contractual liabilities as to a time certain 
our contractual liability is to provide benefits under the policy 
as a result  our calculation of loss and loss adjustment expense payments due by period is subject to the same uncertainties associated with determining the level of loss and loss adjustment expenses generally and to the additional uncertainties arising from the difficulty of predicting when claims including claims that have not yet been reported to us will be paid 
for a discussion of our loss and loss adjustment expense process  see business loss reserves in item of this report 
actual payments of loss and loss adjustment expenses by period will vary  perhaps materially  from the amounts shown in the table above to the extent that current estimates of loss and loss adjustment expenses vary from actual ultimate claims 
table of contents amounts and as a result of variations between expected and actual payout patterns 
see risk factors risks related to our business our loss reserves are based on estimates and may be inadequate to cover our actual losses in item a of this report for a discussion of the uncertainties associated with estimating loss and loss adjustment expenses 
we are subject to various annual assessments imposed by certain of the states in which we write insurance policies 
these assessments are generally based upon the amount of premiums written or losses paid during the applicable year 
assessments based on premiums are generally paid within one year after the calendar year in which the policies are written  while assessments based on losses are generally paid within one year after the loss is paid 
when we establish a reserve for loss and loss adjustment expenses for a reported claim  we accrue our obligation to pay any applicable assessments 
if settlement of the claim is to be paid out over more than one year  our obligation to pay any related loss based assessments extends for the same period of time 
because our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses are based on estimates  our accruals for loss based insurance assessments are also based on estimates 
actual payments of loss and loss adjustment expenses may differ  perhaps materially  from our reserves 
accordingly  our actual loss based insurance assessments may vary  perhaps materially  from our accruals 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of potential economic loss principally arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
the major components of market risk affecting us are credit risk  interest rate risk  and equity price risk 
we currently have no exposure to foreign currency risk 
credit risk credit risk is the potential loss arising principally from adverse changes in the financial condition of the issuers of our fixed maturity securities and the financial condition of our reinsurers 
we address the credit risk related to the issuers of our fixed maturity securities by primarily investing in fixed maturity securities that are rated as investment grade by one or more of moody s  standard poor s or fitch 
we also independently monitor the financial condition of all issuers of our fixed maturity securities 
to limit our risk exposure  we employ diversification policies that limit our credit exposure to any single issuer or business sector 
we are also subject to credit risk with respect to our reinsurers 
although our reinsurers are obligated to reimburse us to the extent we cede risk to them  we are ultimately liable to our policyholders on all risks we have reinsured 
as a result  reinsurance contracts do not limit our ultimate obligations to pay claims and  in some cases  we might not be able to collect amounts recoverable from our reinsurers 
we address this credit risk by initially selecting reinsurers with an am best rating of a excellent or better and by performing  along with our reinsurance broker  periodic credit reviews of our reinsurers 
if one of our reinsurers suffers a credit downgrade  we may consider various options to lessen the risk of asset impairment  including commutation  novation or letters of credit 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources in item of this report 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that we may incur losses due to adverse changes in interest rates 
as of december   we had fixed maturity securities with a fair value of million and a carrying value of 
table of contents million 
these securities are all subject to interest rate risk  but because we classify the majority of our fixed maturity securities as held to maturity  changes in fair values have a small effect on the carrying value of our portfolio 
we manage our exposure to interest rate risk with respect to these securities by investing in a portfolio of securities with moderate effective duration 
at december   the effective duration of the total investment portfolio  including cash and short term investments  was years 
we are also subject to interest rate risk on our subordinated debt security  which has quarterly adjustable interest rates based on libor plus a fixed margin 
as such  fluctuations in interest rates have a direct effect on interest expense associated with our subordinated debt security 
the table below summarizes the interest rate risk associated with our fixed maturity securities by illustrating the sensitivity of the fair value and carrying value of our fixed maturity securities as of december  to selected hypothetical changes in interest rates  and the associated impact on our shareholders equity 
hypothetical change in interest rates fair value estimated change in fair value carrying value estimated change in carrying value hypothetical percentage increase decrease in shareholders equity basis point increase basis point increase no change basis point decrease basis point decrease equity price risk equity price risk is the risk that we may incur losses due to adverse changes in the market prices of the equity securities we hold in our investment portfolio 
we classify our portfolio of equity securities as available for sale and carry these securities on our balance sheet at fair value 
accordingly  adverse changes in the market prices of our equity securities result in a decrease in the value of our total assets and shareholders equity 
in order to minimize our exposure to equity price risk  we independently monitor the financial condition of our equity securities  and diversify our investments 
in addition  we limit the percentage of equity securities held in our investment portfolio to the lesser of of the investment portfolio or of shareholders equity 
as of december   the equity securities in our investment portfolio had a fair value of million  representing of shareholders equity on that date
