item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview and highlights we design  develop  manufacture and sell high performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components 
we own our sales and service network  and market and sell our vehicles directly to consumers via the phone and internet  in person at our corporate events and through our network of tesla stores 
we were incorporated in delaware in july  opened our first store in los angeles  california in may  and introduced our first vehicle  the tesla roadster  in early we are targeting our second vehicle  the model s sedan  for a significantly broader customer base than the tesla roadster and plan to manufacture model s in higher volumes than those for the tesla roadster 
first customer deliveries of model s are planned by july we have also recently revealed an early prototype of the model x crossover  a vehicle based on the model s platform 
this unique vehicle has been designed to fill the niche between the roominess of a minivan and the style of an suv  while having high performance features such as a dual motor all wheel drive system 
during the year ended december   we recognized total revenues of million  an increase of over total revenues of million for the year ended december  automotive sales revenue of million increased from the year ended december   driven by strong customer demand for the tesla roadster globally and significantly higher powertrain component sales 
we completed with cumulative deliveries worldwide from inception of approximately  roadsters and concluded the production run of the tesla roadster in january we expect to sell our remaining tesla roadsters primarily in europe and asia during until our inventory is depleted 
development services revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   due primarily to our development activities for the toyota motor corporation toyota rav ev program for a full electric powertrain system 
we completed planned milestones and deliveries of samples to toyota during the year  and we currently expect to complete our remaining development services milestones and sample deliveries during the first quarter of we made significant progress on the model s program this year and we remain on schedule to commence customer deliveries by july during the year  we moved from building alpha to beta prototypes and performed detailed testing of systems integration  performance and safety 
our significant efforts in development and testing  both of which are ongoing  has allowed us to further refine the overall design of model s and its constituent parts as well as the production and assembly processes to manufacture the vehicle 
in october  
table of contents we finalized a long term supply contract with panasonic corporation for battery cells to be used in our products  which gives us increased visibility into our variable costs 
research and development expenses included expenses related to model s alpha and beta prototype build  development of the tesla factory  significant engineering  design and testing work being undertaken to support model s development  design and engineering activities related to model x  and other research and development activities 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for the year ended december  in addition to model s engineering  we also experienced significant activity at the tesla factory  where we intend to produce our model s  model x and future vehicles 
significant construction has taken place and detailed manufacturing readiness plans are being executed 
almost all of our model s vehicle manufacturing equipment has been installed at the tesla factory 
as part of our testing and qualifying activities of our manufacturing equipment  we are now assembling beta prototype vehicles at the tesla factory and expect to start building release candidate vehicles in the first quarter of during this process  we are continuing to fine tune our production processes and incorporate a higher percentage of production intent components into the cars 
once we complete these activities  the tesla factory will be fully commissioned for production and ready for its intended use 
as a result of investments being made in the tesla factory and related supplier tooling for model s  capital expenditures increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  our capital expenditures in were comprised primarily of payments we had made towards the purchase of the tesla factory from new united motor manufacturing  inc nummi 
with the opening of our santana row store in  we launched what we believe to be a new and unique retail experience designed to engage and inform potential customers about electric vehicles in general  learn about tesla s innovations and configure their cars through hands on interactive screens 
during the year  we further expanded our company owned retail network with the opening of several more stores in the united states utilizing the new store concept embodied by our santana row tesla store 
some of these new stores will replace existing stores which we plan to continue using as service locations 
as a result of our activities to support the sales of the tesla roadster  the opening and operation of new stores  higher store related and marketing activities  as well as the growth of our business in general  we incurred higher selling  general and administrative expenses of million for the year ended december  when compared to expenses of million for the year ended december  in june  we completed a follow on offering of common stock in which a total of  shares of our common stock were sold  and received cash proceeds of million  net of underwriting discounts 
concurrent with this offering  we also sold  shares of common stock to elon musk  our chief executive officer and  shares of common stock to blackstar investco llc  an affiliate of daimler and received total cash proceeds of million in these private placements 
no underwriting discounts or commissions were paid in connection with these private placements 
along with the proceeds from our public offerings and private placements  our continued draw downs under the department of energy loan facility doe loan facility and other sources of cash including cash from the sales of the tesla roadster  development services to toyota  sales of powertrain components to daimler  and cash received from refundable reservation payments for our model s  provided the liquidity to fund our model s  model x and powertrain development activities  as well as our capital investments in manufacturing infrastructure 
during the year ended december   we received million in draw downs under the doe loan facility bringing our total long term debt under the facility to million 
as we continue to progress on our model s and powertrain activities  we expect to continue making draw downs under the doe loan facility 
as of december   we had million in principal sources of liquidity available from our cash and cash equivalents  short term marketable securities  cash held in our dedicated doe account and the remaining amounts available under the doe loan facility 
this includes our cash and cash equivalents in the 
table of contents amount of million which includes investments in money market funds  short term marketable securities of million  cash of million deposited in a dedicated doe account in accordance with the requirements of our doe loan facility  and million available under the doe loan facility 
we expect that these principal sources of liquidity together with our current projections of cash flow from operating activities will provide us adequate liquidity until we reach profitability in management opportunities  challenges and risks our principal focus has continued to be on the disciplined development of model s so that we can commence deliveries by july we have also been focused on the continued sales of the tesla roadster and powertrain components  development services activities with our strategic partners  advanced engineering work on the planned model x and pursuing new electric powertrain opportunities with automobile manufacturers 
in january  we concluded the production run of our current generation tesla roadster 
through december   we had delivered approximately  roadsters to customers 
we plan to sell our remaining tesla roadsters during primarily in europe and asia until our inventory is depleted 
powertrain component sales in were driven primarily by our deliveries to supply daimler ag daimler with battery packs and chargers for the daimler smart fortwo and a class ev programs 
we completed both of these production programs as of december  in july  we entered into a supply and services agreement with toyota for the production of an electric powertrain system  including a battery pack  charging system  inverter  motor  gearbox and associated software  which will be integrated into the toyota rav ev 
additionally  we will provide toyota with certain services related to the supply of these components 
pursuant to the agreement  toyota will pay us approximately million from through based on our delivery of these components for the toyota rav ev 
due to the wind down of the daimler smart fortwo and a class ev production programs at the end of  we expect powertrain component sales to be limited until the planned start of production of the toyota rav ev powertrain system in the first half of as we have a limited number of the tesla roadsters left for sale and as we expect powertrain component sales to decline until the start of production for the toyota rav ev program  we anticipate our automotive sales will decline  potentially significantly  just prior to the planned launch of our model s 
the launch of our model s could be delayed for a number of reasons and any such delays may be significant and would extend the period in which we would generate limited revenues from sales of our electric vehicles and electric powertrain systems 
we completed all of our planned milestones and deliveries of samples to toyota during  and we currently expect to complete our remaining development services milestones and sample deliveries during the first quarter of as such  we expect that the remaining development services revenue under the toyota rav ev program will also be recognized in the first quarter 
since the revenue related to development services milestones are recognized when achieved while milestone costs must be expensed as incurred  our development services gross margin will reflect this favorability when we recognize our final toyota rav ev milestones in in november  we received a letter of intent from daimler for a full electric powertrain program for a vehicle in the mercedes line and recently  we received a purchase order to begin the development work 
however  we have not yet finalized with daimler the terms for this program and may never do so 
due to timing differences that may arise between the recognition of future milestone revenue and the underlying costs of development services  the gross margin from our development services activities may vary from period to period as we have seen under our previous development services agreements including that for the toyota rav ev program 
the build of model s beta prototypes continues to progress and we will begin building release candidate vehicles in the first quarter of we continue to work closely with suppliers to design  develop and test components that will meet our anticipated production design specifications and schedule 
ensuring that our design  engineering  operations and manufacturing engineering teams  and our suppliers  execute on all 
table of contents significant activities will be critical to a timely launch of first customer deliveries of our model s by july our continuing negotiations with suppliers and the adequate maturation of our manufacturing capabilities will influence our ability to achieve the cost per unit that we are currently projecting 
our plan to commence deliveries of model s by july is also dependent upon the timely availability of funds from the doe loan facility  upon our finalizing the related design  engineering  component procurement  testing  build out and manufacturing plans in a timely manner and upon our ability to execute these plans within the current timeline 
in february  we revealed an early prototype of the model x crossover as the first vehicle we intend to develop by leveraging the model s platform 
this unique vehicle has been designed to fill the niche between the roominess of a minivan and the style of an suv  while having high performance features such as a dual motor all wheel drive system 
we currently plan to start production of model x in the fourth quarter of with significant deliveries in our ability to develop and introduce the model x in this timeframe is based on our expectations of leveraging the model s platform 
additionally  if there is a lower level of commonality between model s and model x than anticipated  our future development and tooling costs may exceed expectations 
our operating expenses in have been significant as we continued to execute on the model s program and are systematically and strategically expanding our sales and service infrastructure globally to support the launch of model s 
as we continue to make significant investments in research and development and our infrastructure to launch model s as well as incur costs for the development of model x  we expect to continue generating a net loss until we reach planned volume sales of model s in as pre production expenses and development and prototyping costs cannot be capitalized  we expect our operating expenses to continue increasing due to our ongoing activities to prepare the tesla factory for production  refine model s through our engineering and testing on beta prototype and release candidate vehicles  and continue the advanced engineering work on model x 
once we start recognizing revenue from the sales of model s  our model s production costs  including direct parts  material and labor costs  manufacturing overhead and amortized tooling  and logistics  will begin to be reflected in cost of automotive sales 
capital spending for the model s program will continue into as we complete our commissioning activities of the tesla factory and as we make final payments for tooling and manufacturing equipment required for production 
depreciation of our capital expenditures related to the manufacturing of model s will begin with the start of model s production 
we anticipate that most of the capital expenditures on model s will continue to be funded by the doe loan facility until the launch of model s 
we also anticipate our aggregate capital expenditures for to be comparable to that in  primarily focused on vehicle development and manufacturing activities for model s and model x 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience  as appropriate  and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
accordingly  actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our future financial statement presentation  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows will be affected 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity than our other accounting policies 
accordingly  these are the policies we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents revenue recognition automotive sales we recognize automotive sales revenue from sales of the tesla roadster  including vehicle options  accessories and destination charges  vehicle service and sales of zero emission vehicle  or zev credits 
we also recognize automotive sales revenue from the sales of electric vehicle powertrain components  such as battery packs and battery chargers  to other manufacturers 
we recognize revenue when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance  iii fees are fixed or determinable  and iv collection is reasonably assured 
automotive sales consist primarily of revenue earned from the sale of vehicles 
sales or other amounts collected in advance of meeting all of the revenue recognition criteria are not recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and are instead recorded as deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets 
prior to february  we did not provide direct financing for the purchase of the tesla roadster although a third party lender has provided financing arrangements to our customers in the united states 
under these arrangements we have been paid in full by the customer at the time of purchase 
starting in february  we began offering a leasing program to qualified customers in the united states 
automotive sales also consist of revenue earned from the sales of vehicle options  accessories and destination charges 
while these sales may take place separately from a vehicle sale  they are often part of one vehicle sale agreement resulting in multiple element arrangements 
contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting for recognition of our revenue  including whether the deliverables specified in the multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting  and  if so  how the price should be allocated among the elements  when to recognize revenue for each element  and the period over which revenue should be recognized 
we are also required to evaluate whether a delivered item has value on a stand alone basis prior to delivery of the remaining items by determining whether we have made separate sales of such items or whether the undelivered items are essential to the functionality of the delivered items 
further  we assess whether we know the fair value of the undelivered items  determined by reference to stand alone sales of such items 
to date  we have been able to establish the fair value for each of the deliverables within the multiple element arrangements because we sell each of the vehicles  vehicle accessories and options separately  outside of any multiple element arrangements 
as each of these items has stand alone value to the customer  revenue from sales of vehicle accessories and options are recognized when those specific items are delivered to the customer 
increased complexity to our sales agreements or changes in our judgments and estimates regarding application of these revenue recognition guidelines could result in a change in the timing or amount of revenue recognized in future periods 
effective january   we adopted amended accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements on a prospective basis for applicable transactions originating or materially modified after january  the new standard changes the requirements for establishing separate units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement and requires the allocation of arrangement consideration to each deliverable to be based on the relative selling price 
for fiscal and future periods  when a sales arrangement contains multiple elements  we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy 
the selling price for a deliverable is based on its vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available  third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available  or estimated selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
to date  we have been able to establish the fair value for each of the deliverables within the multiple element arrangements because we sell each of the vehicles  vehicles accessories and options separately  outside of any multiple element arrangements 
therefore  there were no material differences between total revenue reported and pro forma total revenues that would have been reported during the year ended december   if the transactions entered into or materially modified after january  were subject to previous accounting guidance 

table of contents development services revenue from development services arrangements consist of revenue earned from the development of electric vehicle powertrain components for other automobile manufacturers  including the design and development of battery packs  chargers and sample vehicles to meet a customer s specifications 
beginning in the quarter ended march   we started entering into such contracts with the expectation that our development services would constitute a viable revenue generating activity 
revenue is recognized as a development arrangement is finalized  the performance requirements of each development arrangement are met and collection is reasonably assured 
where development arrangements include substantive at risk milestones  revenue is recognized based upon the achievement of the contractually defined milestones 
amounts collected in advance of meeting all of the revenue recognition criteria are not recognized in the consolidated statement of operations and are instead recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet 
increased complexity to our development agreements or changes in our judgments and estimates regarding application of these revenue recognition guidelines could result in a change in the timing or amount of revenue recognized in future periods 
costs of development services are expensed as incurred 
costs of development services incurred in periods prior to the finalization of an agreement are recorded as research and development expenses  once an agreement is finalized  these costs are recorded in cost of development services 
prior to  compensation from the smart fortwo ev development arrangement with daimler  which is discussed below under development compensation  was recorded as an offset to research and development expenses 
this early arrangement was motivated primarily by the opportunity to engage daimler and at the same time  jointly progress our own research and development activities with the associated development compensation 
development compensation we began receiving payments under the smart fortwo ev development arrangement with daimler in the year ended december  to compensate us for the cost of our development activities 
we deferred recognition for these payments received in advance of the execution of the final agreement because a number of significant contractual terms were not in place prior to that time 
upon entering into the final agreement in may  we began recognizing the deferred development compensation as an offset to our research and development expenses on a straight line basis 
this amount was recognized over the expected life of the agreement  beginning in may and continuing through november payments that we received upon the achievement of development milestones subsequent to contract execution in may were recognized upon achievement and acceptance of the respective milestones 
all amounts received under this development agreement have been recognized as an offset to our research and development expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 
all development activities under this agreement were completed as of december  marketable securities during the year ended december   we purchased marketable securities including commercial paper and corporate debt 
all marketable securities are designated as available for sale and reported at estimated fair value  with unrealized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss which is included within stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses on the sale of available for sale marketable securities are recorded in other expense  net 
the cost of available for sale marketable securities sold is based on the specific identification method 
interest  dividends  amortization and accretion of purchase premiums and discounts on our marketable securities are included in other expense  net 
available for sale marketable securities with maturities greater than three months at the date of purchase and remaining maturities of one year or less are classified as short term marketable securities 
where temporary declines in fair value exist  we have the ability and the intent to hold these securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 

table of contents we regularly review all of our marketable securities for other than temporary declines in fair value 
the review includes but is not limited to i the consideration of the cause of the impairment  ii the creditworthiness of the security issuers  iii the length of time a security is in an unrealized loss position  and iv our ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
inventory valuation we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
cost is computed using standard cost  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis 
we record inventory write downs for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventories based upon assumptions about future demand forecasts 
if our inventory on hand is in excess of our future demand forecast  the excess amounts are written off 
we also review inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory 
this requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert inventory on hand into a finished product 
once inventory is written down  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
during the years ended december   and  we recorded write downs of million  million and million  in cost of automotive sales  respectively 
the inventory amounts are based on our current estimates of demand  selling prices and production costs 
should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change  material changes to these reserves may be required 
further  a small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results 
warranties we accrue warranty reserves at the time a vehicle or powertrain component is delivered to a customer 
warranty reserves include management s best estimate of the projected costs to repair or to replace any items under warranty  based on actual warranty experience as it becomes available and other known factors that may impact our evaluation of historical data 
we review our reserves at least quarterly to ensure that our accruals are adequate in meeting expected future warranty obligations  and we will adjust our estimates as needed 
initial warranty data can be limited early in the launch of a new vehicle or powertrain component and accordingly  the adjustments that we record may be material 
as of december  and  we had million and million in warranty reserves  respectively 
adjustments to warranty reserves are recorded in cost of automotive sales 
it is likely that as we sell additional tesla roadsters and powertrain components and as we repair or replace items under warranty  we will acquire additional information on the projected costs to service work under warranty and may need to make additional adjustments 
further  a small change in our warranty estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results 
valuation of stock based awards  common stock and warrants stock based compensation we use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options granted to employees and employee stock purchase plan espp which require us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock based awards  based on the grant date fair value of the awards 
the fair value of the awards is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
the resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards  usually the vesting period which is generally four years for stock options and six months for the espp 
stock based compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis  net of forfeitures 

table of contents the fair value of each stock based award was estimated on the grant date for the periods below using the black scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions 
year ended december  risk free interest rate stock options espp expected term in years stock options espp expected volatility stock options espp dividend yield stock options espp if in the future we determine that another method for calculating the fair value of our stock based awards is more reasonable  or if another method for calculating the above input assumptions is prescribed by authoritative guidance  the fair value calculated for our stock based awards could change significantly 
the black scholes option pricing model requires inputs such as the risk free interest rate  expected term and expected volatility 
further  the forfeiture rate also affects the amount of aggregate compensation 
these inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment 
the risk free interest rate that we use is based on the united states treasury yield in effect at the time of grant for zero coupon united states treasury notes with maturities approximating each grant s expected life 
given our limited history with employee grants  we use the simplified method in estimating the expected term for our employee grants 
the simplified method  as permitted by the sec  is calculated as the average of the time to vesting and the contractual life of the options 
our expected volatility is derived from the historical volatilities of several unrelated public companies within industries related to our business  including the automotive oem  automotive retail  automotive parts and battery technology industries  because we have limited trading history on our common stock 
when making the selections of our peer companies within industries related to our business to be used in the volatility calculation  we also considered the stage of development  size and financial leverage of potential comparable companies 
our historical volatility is weighted based on certain qualitative factors and combined to produce a single volatility factor 
we estimate our forfeiture rate based on an analysis of our actual forfeitures and will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience  analysis of employee turnover behavior and other factors 
quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported stock based compensation expense  as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 
if a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate  an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
if a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate  an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
as we accumulate additional employee stock based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock  we may calculate significantly different volatilities  expected lives and 
table of contents forfeiture rates  which could materially impact the valuation of our stock based awards and the stock based compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods 
stock based compensation expense is recorded in our cost of revenues  research and development expenses  and selling  general and administrative expenses 
unadjusted error in in june  we identified an error related to the understatement in stock based compensation expense subsequent to the issuance of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  in the fourth quarter of  we granted certain stock options for which a portion of the grant was immediately vested 
we erroneously accounted for the expense on a straight line basis over the term of the award  while expense recognition should always be at least commensurate with the number of awards vesting during the period 
as a result  selling  general and administrative expenses and net loss for the year ended december  were understated by million 
the error did not have an effect on the valuation of the stock options 
as stock based compensation expense is a non cash item  there was no impact on net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  to correct this error  we recorded additional stock based compensation of million during the three months ended june  we considered the impact of the error on reported operating expenses and trends in operating results and determined that the impact of the error was not material to previously reported financial information as well as those related to the three months ended june  common stock valuation upon the completion of our ipo on july   our common stock has been valued by reference to its publicly traded price 
prior to the ipo  we historically granted stock options with exercise prices equal to the fair value of our common stock as determined at the date of grant by our board of directors 
because there was no public market for our common stock  our board of directors determined the fair value of our common stock by considering a number of objective and subjective factors  including the following our sales of convertible preferred stock to unrelated third parties  our operating and financial performance  the lack of liquidity of our capital stock  trends in our industry  arm s length  third party sales of our stock  and contemporaneous valuations performed by an unrelated third party 

table of contents there is inherent uncertainty in these estimates and if we had made different assumptions than those used  the amount of our stock based compensation expense  net loss and net loss per share amounts could have been significantly different 
the following table summarizes  by grant date  the number of stock options granted since january  through the completion of our ipo on july   and the associated per share exercise price  which equaled the fair value of our common stock for each of these grants 
grant date number of options granted exercise price and fair value per share of common stock june  july  september  october  march  april  april  august  october  december  december  march  april  june  included in the december  awards  were  stock options granted to our chief executive officer comprised of two grants 
in recognition of his and our company s achievements and to create incentives for future success  the board of directors approved an option grant representing of our fully diluted share base prior to such grant as of december   or  stock options  with th of the shares vesting immediately  and th of the remaining shares scheduled to vest each month over three years  assuming continued employment through each vesting date 
in addition  to create incentives for the attainment of clear performance objectives around a key element of our current business plan the successful launch and commercialization of model s the board of directors approved additional options totaling an additional of our fully diluted shares prior to such grant as of december   with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of performance objectives as follows  assuming mr 
musk s continued service to us through each vesting date th of the shares subject to the option are scheduled to vest upon the successful completion of model s engineering prototype  th of the shares subject to the option are scheduled to vest upon the successful completion of model s validation prototype  th of the shares subject to the option are scheduled to vest upon the completion of the first model s production vehicle  and th of the shares subject to the option are scheduled to vest upon the completion of the  th model s production vehicle 
if mr 
musk does not meet one or more of the above milestones prior to the fourth anniversary of the date of grant  he will forfeit his right to the unvested portion of the grant 
included in our june and september stock option grants were  and  stock options granted respectively  to various members of our senior management with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of the same performance objectives as those outlined for mr 
musk above 

table of contents prior to our ipo which was completed on july   our board of directors performed valuations of our common stock for purposes of granting stock options in a manner consistent with the methods outlined in the american institute of certified public accountants practice aid  valuation of privately held company equity securities issued as compensation 
the enterprise value input of our common stock valuations were derived either using fundamental analysis income and market approaches or based on a recent round of financing option pricing approach 
the income approach estimates the enterprise value of the company by discounting the expected future cash flows of the company to present value 
we have applied discount rates that reflect the risks associated with our cash flow projections and have used venture capital rates of return for companies at a similar stage of development as us  as a proxy for our cost of capital 
our discounted cash flow calculations are sensitive to highly subjective assumptions that we were required to make at each valuation date relating to appropriate discount rates for various components of our business 
for example  the discount rates used to value the cash flow projections from the model s business factored in the low cost debt we expected to raise from the us department of energy 
valuation date range of discount rates may  december  february  may  august  october  november  february  april  june  our projected cash flows were primarily derived from our tesla roadster  model s and powertrain revenue streams 
in more recent valuations  these cash flow projections took into account the fact that we had been selling the tesla roadster since  that we began selling powertrain components in the quarter ended december  and our anticipation of model s production in mid under the market approach  the total enterprise value of the company was estimated by comparing our business to similar businesses whose securities are actively traded in public markets  or businesses that are involved in a public or private transaction 
prior transactions in our stock were also considered as part of the market approach methodology 
we selected revenue valuation multiples derived from trading multiples of public companies that participate in the automotive oem  automotive retail  automotive parts and battery technology industries 
these valuation multiples were then applied to the equivalent financial metric of our business  giving consideration to differences between our company and similar companies for such factors as company size and growth prospects 
for those reports that relied on the fundamental analysis  we prepared a financial forecast to be used in the computation of the enterprise value for both the market approach and the income approach 
the financial forecasts took into account our past experience and future expectations 
the risks associated with achieving these forecasts were assessed in selecting the appropriate discount rate 
as discussed below  there is inherent uncertainty in these estimates 
second  we allocated the resulting equity value among the securities that comprise our capital structure using the option pricing method 
the aggregate value of the common stock derived from the option pricing method was then divided by the number of common shares outstanding to arrive at the per common share value 
for those reports before our ipo that relied on the recent round of financing  we back solved for the total equity value such that the value of the instrument sold in the recent round as calculated by the option pricing model was consistent with the observed transaction price 

table of contents our board of directors considered the valuations derived from the approaches above  the probability and timing of completing an ipo as of those dates  as well as other qualitative factors in arriving at our common stock valuations  including the following significant operating losses since inception  macroeconomic uncertainty in  the absence of a significant ipo market throughout and continuing through the second quarter of  and other market developments that influence forecasted revenue 
our common stock valuations have required the significant use of estimates and assumptions 
if different estimates and assumptions had been used  our common stock valuations could have been significantly different and related stock based compensation expense may be materially impacted 
warrants we have accounted for our freestanding warrants to purchase shares of our convertible preferred stock as liabilities at fair value upon issuance 
we have recorded the warrants as a liability because the underlying shares of convertible preferred stock are contingently redeemable and  therefore  may obligate us to transfer assets at some point in the future 
the warrants are subject to re measurement to fair value at each balance sheet date and any change in fair value is recognized as a component of other expense  net  on the consolidated statements of operations 
in january  we issued a warrant to the doe in connection with the closing of the doe loan facility to purchase shares of our series e convertible preferred stock at an exercise price of per share 
this convertible preferred stock warrant became a warrant to purchase shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share upon the closing of our ipo in july beginning on december  and until december   the shares subject to purchase under the warrant will become exercisable in quarterly amounts depending on the average outstanding balance of the doe loan facility during the prior quarter 
the warrant may be exercised until december  if we prepay the doe loan facility in part or in full  the total amount of shares exercisable under the warrant will be reduced 
since the number of shares of common stock ultimately issuable under the warrant will vary  this warrant will be carried at its estimated fair value with changes in its fair value reflected in other expense  net  until its expiration or vesting 
our ability to prepay the doe loan facility and consequently  the number of shares ultimately issuable under the doe warrant  was determined to represent an embedded derivative 
this embedded derivative is inherently valued and accounted for as part of the warrant 
since the number of shares ultimately issuable under the doe warrants will vary depending on the average outstanding balance of the loan during the contractual vesting period  and decisions to prepay would be influenced by our future stock price as well as the interest rates on our loans in relation to market interest rates  we measured the fair value of the doe warrant using a monte carlo simulation approach 
the monte carlo approach simulates various scenarios and captures the optimal decisions to be made between prepaying the doe loan and the cancellation of the doe warrant over the expected term of the doe loan facility of years 
for the purposes of the simulation  the optimal decision represents the scenario with the lowest economic cost to us 
the total warrant value would then be calculated as the average warrant payoff across all simulated paths discounted to our valuation date 
the significant assumptions that we use in the valuation of the doe warrant include similar assumptions used in the valuation of otherwise featureless stock warrants at various simulated stock prices  as well as the interest rate differential between the interest rates under our doe loan facility and market interest rates for companies comparable to us 
the estimated value of our stock warrant requires us to use a black scholes 
table of contents option pricing model  which incorporates several assumptions that are subject to significant management judgment as is the case for stock based compensation discussed above 
the differential between the interest rates under our doe loan facility and market interest rates is derived from the credit spread data of several unrelated public companies within industries related to our business 
as the average simulated value of our stock warrant increases relative to the credit spread of our comparator companies  the fair value of our doe warrant decreases since the economic cost of prepaying our outstanding loans under the doe loan facility and replacing the funds with market interest rate debt  would be lower than the economic cost associated with the dilution caused by the vesting of warrants 
similarly  as the credit spread of our comparator companies increases relative to the average simulated value of our stock warrant  the fair value of our doe warrant increases since the economic cost associated with prepaying our outstanding loans under the doe loan facility and replacing the funds with market interest rate debt is higher than the economic cost associated with the dilution caused by the vesting of warrants  and therefore  we would not prepay our outstanding doe debt and we would allow a higher number of warrants to vest 
prior to completion of our ipo  the fair value of the doe warrant was included within the convertible preferred stock warrant liability on the consolidated balance sheet 
upon the completion of our ipo on july   this warrant was reclassified on our consolidated balance sheet from convertible preferred stock warrant liability to common stock warrant liability 
the doe warrant will continue to be recorded at its estimated fair value with changes in the fair value reflected in other expense  net  as the number of common stock ultimately issuable under the warrant is variable until its expiration or vesting 
the relative movements in our stock price as compared to the credit spread of our comparator companies will result in fair value changes being recorded in other expense  net  in future periods which may be significant 
excluding the warrant issued to the doe in january  we have estimated the fair value of our convertible preferred stock warrants at the respective balance sheet dates using a black scholes option pricing model which used several assumptions that are subject to significant management judgment as is the case for stock based compensation as discussed above 
upon the completion of our ipo in july  these convertible preferred stock warrants outstanding as of june   were net exercised and the related convertible preferred stock warrant liability was settled 
income taxes we record our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of operations by estimating our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences arising from differing treatment of items recognized for financial reporting versus tax return purposes 
in general  deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in our consolidated statements of operations become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws  or loss or credit carryforwards are utilized 
valuation allowances are recorded when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we make these estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our future plans 
as of december   we had recorded a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets because we expect that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future 
should the actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted 
furthermore  significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions 
in the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain 
as a result  we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes based on our estimates of the eventual outcome 
these effects are recognized when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable  we believe that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities 
we are required to file income tax returns in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions  
table of contents which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions 
such returns are subject to audit by the various federal  state and foreign taxing authorities  who may disagree with respect to our tax positions 
we believe that our accounting consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors  including past experience and interpretations of tax law 
we review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit  the lapse of a statute of limitations or a material change in estimate 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations  such differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made 
the eventual impact on our income tax expense depends in part if we still have a valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets in the period that such determination is made 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued an accounting standard update  which revises the manner in which companies present comprehensive income in their financial statements 
the new guidance removes the presentation options and requires entities to report components of comprehensive income in either a continuous statement of comprehensive income or two separate but consecutive statements 
in december  the fasb further amended its guidance to defer changes related to the presentation of reclassification adjustments indefinitely 
the guidance other than the portion regarding the presentation of reclassification adjustments which  as noted above  has been deferred indefinitely is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted 
we anticipate adopting the guidance in fiscal we do not expect the adoption of the guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued updated guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures which requires a reporting entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level i and level ii fair value measurements and to describe the reasons for the transfers 
in addition  in the reconciliation of fair value measurements using level iii inputs  a reporting entity will be required to disclose information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements on a gross rather than on a net basis 
the updated guidance will also require fair value disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities and disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and non recurring level ii and level iii fair value measurements 
the adoption of this updated guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data for the periods presented in thousands  except per share data year ended december  revenues automotive sales development services total revenues cost of revenues automotive sales development services total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development net of development compensation of  for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative total operating expenses loss from operations interest income interest expense other expense  net loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net loss revenues automotive sales automotive sales  which include vehicle  options and related sales  and powertrain component and related sales  consisted of the following for the periods presented in thousands year ended december  vehicle  options and related sales powertrain component and related sales total automotive sales automotive sales for the year ended december  were million  an increase from million for the year ended december  vehicle  options and related sales represent sales of the tesla roadster  including vehicle options  accessories and destination charges  vehicle service and sales of zero emission vehicle credits 
powertrain component and related sales represent the sales of electric vehicle powertrain components  such as battery packs and battery chargers  to other manufacturers 
vehicle  options and related sales for the year ended december  were million  an increase from million for the year ended december  the increase in vehicle  options and related sales was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of tesla roadsters that we sold  particularly in north america 
table of contents and asia  coupled with slightly higher average selling prices 
under our supply agreement with lotus  we have built  roadster gliders 
we plan to sell our remaining tesla roadsters primarily in europe and asia during until our inventory is depleted 
in february  we began offering a leasing program to qualified customers in the united states for the tesla roadster 
through our wholly owned subsidiary  qualifying customers are permitted to lease the tesla roadster for months  after which time they have the option of either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing it for a pre determined residual value 
we account for these leasing transactions as operating leases and accordingly  we recognize leasing revenues on a straight line basis over the term of the individual leases 
lease revenues are recorded in vehicle  options and related sales within automotive sales revenue and for the years ended december  and  we recognized million and million  respectively 
during the years ended december  and  approximately and of the vehicles delivered during those years were under operating leases 
as of december  and  we had deferred revenues of million and million of down payments which will be recognized over the term of the individual leases  respectively 
powertrain component and related sales for the year ended december  were million  an increase from million for the year ended december  the increase in powertrain component and related sales was primarily due to significant shipments of battery packs and chargers to daimler 
we began delivering battery packs and chargers for the daimler smart fortwo ev program at the end of  and for the daimler a class ev program late in the fourth quarter of production for both the smart fortwo and a class ev programs was completed as of december  automotive sales for the year ended december  were million  a decrease from million for the year ended december  vehicle  options and related sales for the year ended december  were million  a decrease from million for the year ended december  during the first three quarters of  we continued to fulfill reservations for the tesla roadster and we had made a significant effort to increase our production capacity in order to accelerate deliveries to customers who had been on our waitlist for a significant amount of time 
as a result  a significant portion of the revenue recognized during the first three quarters of came from fulfilling reservations placed prior to beginning with the fourth quarter of  sales of the tesla roadster began more closely approximating the level of orders placed during the quarter 
consequently  the comparison of revenue for the year ended december  versus the year ended december  may not be meaningful 
similarly  zev credit sales which are included in vehicle  options and related sales  were higher during the year ended december  as the fulfillment of a significant number of reservations allowed us to sell a larger number of zev credits 
the year over year decrease in vehicle deliveries was partially offset by higher selling prices from an expanded offering of vehicle options to our customers as well as higher average selling prices outside of the united states 
powertrain component and related sales for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we were selected by daimler to supply it with battery packs and chargers to support a trial of the smart fortwo ev program in a least five european cities 
we began delivering and recognizing revenue for these production battery packs and chargers at the end of prior to  most of our revenues had been generated through sales of our vehicles in the united states and we had no revenues from sales outside of the united states prior to the third quarter of our international sales commenced with the launch of the tesla roadster in europe in july and since then  we have recognized revenue from sales of the tesla roadster in additional countries including canada  japan and hong kong 
for the years ended december   and   and of our revenue from vehicle  options and related sales  respectively  were derived outside of the united states 
for the same periods  all of our powertrain component and related sales were derived outside of the united states 

table of contents development services development services represent arrangements where we develop electric vehicle powertrain components for other automobile manufacturers  including the design and development of battery packs and chargers to meet customer s specifications 
development services revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase from million for the year ended december  beginning in the first quarter of  we started entering into development services arrangements with the expectation that our development services would constitute a viable revenue generating activity 
we began recognizing development services revenue during the first quarter of with the development and delivery of modular battery packs for freightliner custom chassis corporation freightliner  an affiliate of daimler 
these battery packs were to be used in electric delivery vans in a limited number of freightliner s customer trials 
prior to  compensation that we had received from our first development arrangement with daimler for battery packs and chargers for its smart fortwo ev program  was recorded as an offset to research and development expenses 
this early arrangement was motivated primarily by the opportunity to engage daimler and at the same time  jointly progress our own research and development activities with the associated development compensation 
during the first quarter of  daimler also engaged us to assist with the development and production of a battery pack and charger for a pilot fleet of its a class electric vehicles to be introduced in europe during we began providing development services for this program during the first quarter of and had received an aggregate of million in payments  however  as we had not executed a final agreement related to this program as of march   we deferred the million of payments that had been received from daimler to that point 
in may  we executed a final agreement under which daimler would make additional payments to us for the successful completion of certain development milestones and the delivery of prototype samples 
as of december   we had completed our deliverables under this agreement and for the year ended december   we recognized million in development services revenue 
in july  we entered into an agreement with toyota to initiate development of an electric powertrain for the toyota rav ev 
under this phase development agreement  prototypes would be made by us by combining the toyota rav model with a tesla electric powertrain 
through june   we had completed all prototype vehicles under the phase agreement and for the years ended december  and  we recognized million and million in development service revenue  respectively 
in october  we also entered into a phase contract services agreement with toyota for the development of a validated powertrain system  including a battery pack  power electronics module  motor  gearbox and associated software  which will be integrated into an electric vehicle version of the toyota rav pursuant to this agreement  toyota would pay us up to million for the anticipated development services to be provided by us over the expected term of our performance  including a million upfront payment that we received upon the execution of the agreement 
during the year ended december  and  we completed various milestones and delivered samples under the phase agreement 
including the amortization of our upfront payment  for the years ended december  and  we recognized million and million in development services revenue  respectively  under the phase agreement 
we expect that the phase agreement  and the associated development services revenues  will be completed by early we intend to grow our development services revenue over time by establishing additional commercial arrangements with other automobile manufacturers and by looking for new development opportunities with existing strategic partners 
additionally  we expect our development services revenue may fluctuate in future periods based on the timing of our delivery of milestones and samples  as well as the timing of meeting revenue recognition criteria 

table of contents cost of revenues and gross profit cost of revenues includes cost of automotive sales and costs related to our development services 
cost of revenues for the year ended december  was million  an increase from million for the year ended december  the increase in cost of automotive sales for the year ended december  was driven primarily by an increase in the number of vehicles that we sold and the increased shipments of battery packs and chargers to daimler 
we began delivering battery packs and chargers for the daimler smart fortwo ev program at the end of and for the daimler a class ev program at the end of cost of development services includes engineering support and testing  direct parts  material and labor costs  manufacturing overhead  including amortized tooling costs  shipping and logistic costs and other development expenses that we incur in the performance of our services under development agreements 
the increase in cost of development services was driven primarily by our activities for the toyota rav ev program which began in the second half of gross profit for the year ended december  was million  an increase from million for the year ended december  the increase was driven primarily by higher sales of the tesla roadster coupled with higher average selling prices and ongoing cost improvement program on the roadster  increased shipments of battery packs and chargers to daimler  as well as gross profit from our development services activities which we expanded in the latter half of with the toyota rav ev program 
cost of revenues for the year ended december  was million  a decrease from million for the year ended december  the decrease in cost of revenues was driven primarily by the significant number of vehicles delivered during the first three quarters of from fulfilling customer reservations placed prior to the decrease in cost of revenues from automotive sales for the year ended december  was partially offset by the increase in cost of revenues from our development services activities 
cost of development services includes engineering support and testing  direct parts  material and labor costs  manufacturing overhead  including amortized tooling costs  shipping and logistic costs and other development expenses that we incur in the performance of our services under development agreements 
during the quarter ended march   daimler engaged us to assist with the development and production of a battery pack and charger for a pilot fleet of its a class electric vehicles to be introduced in europe during as of march   a development agreement had yet to be finalized and as such  the related development services costs of million that we incurred during the quarter ended march  were expensed in research and development 
in may  we finalized the agreement and began recording the costs related to this program in cost of revenues 
gross profit for the year ended december  was million  an increase from million for the year ended december  the increase was driven primarily by the gross profit contributed by our development services revenues which we began to recognize in  an expanded offering of vehicle options to our customers  the continued launch of the tesla roadster internationally  where in certain markets  we have experienced higher selling prices  and cost improvements associated with the model changeover from the tesla roadster to the tesla roadster during the second half of gross profit for the year ended december  was also favorably impacted by the fact that certain of the a class development services revenue that we recognized during the year ended december  did not have any corresponding cost of revenues  since these costs were recorded in research and development expenses prior to us finalizing the development agreement in may we expect our development services revenue may fluctuate in future periods based on the timing of cash receipts as compared to the timing of meeting revenue recognition criteria 
this may cause our gross profit and gross margin to be similarly impacted 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our teams in engineering and research  supply chain  quality  manufacturing engineering and manufacturing test organizations  prototyping 
table of contents expense  contract and professional services and amortized equipment expense 
overhead costs related to the tesla factory prior to the start of production of model s are also included in research and development expenses 
also included in research and development expenses are development services costs that we incur  if any  prior to the finalization of agreements with our development services customers as reaching a final agreement and revenue recognition is not assured 
development services costs incurred after the finalization of an agreement are recorded in cost of revenues 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  an increase from million for the year ended december  the million increase in research and development expenses during the year ended december  consisted primarily of a million increase in materials and prototyping expenses primarily to support our model s alpha and beta builds  overhead costs related to the tesla factory  powertrain development activities  a million increase in costs related to model s and model x engineering  design and testing activities incurred by our suppliers  a million increase in employee compensation expenses from higher headcount  a million increase in stock based compensation expense related to a larger number of outstanding equity awards and generally an increasing common stock valuation applied to new grants  and a million increase in office  information technology and facilities related costs to support the growth of our business 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  an increase from million for the year ended december  research and development expenses during the year ended december  included million in daimler smart fortwo ev development compensation which was recorded as an offset to research and development expenses 
the million increase in research and development expenses during the year ended december  consisted primarily of a million increase in employee cash and stock based compensation expenses primarily associated with significantly higher headcount to support our model s and powertrain development activities  the million daimler development compensation offset recognized during the year ended december   a million increase in materials and prototyping expenses primarily to support our model s alpha build as well as powertrain development activities  a million increase in professional and outside services costs related to model s engineering  design and testing activities  and a million increase in office  information technology and facilities related costs to support the growth of our business  including our transition to our palo alto headquarters 
during the first quarter of  daimler engaged us to assist with the development and production of a battery pack and charger for a pilot fleet of its a class electric vehicles to be introduced in europe during as of march   a development agreement had yet to be finalized and as such  the related development services costs of million that we incurred during the quarter ended march  were expensed in research and development 
in may  we finalized the agreement and began recording the costs associated with this program in cost of revenues 
we have significantly increased our research and development efforts for model s  which has resulted in an increase in our research and development expenses 
we anticipate that our research and development expenses will rise moderately as we incur additional costs to further develop model s  to develop model x and to operate our tesla factory in fremont  california prior to the start of model s production 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and facilities costs related to our tesla stores  marketing  sales  executive  finance  human resources  information technology and legal organizations  as well as litigation settlements and fees for professional and contract services 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  an increase from million for the year ended december  the million increase in our selling  general and administrative expenses during the year ended december  consisted primarily of a 
table of contents million increase in employee compensation expenses related to higher sales and marketing headcount to support sales activities worldwide and higher general and administrative headcount to support the expansion of the business  a million increase in office  information technology and facilities related costs to support the growth of our business  a million increase in professional and outside services costs  and a million increase in costs principally related to our tesla store and gallery openings 
the increase is also attributable to a million increase in stock based compensation expense related to a larger number of outstanding equity awards and generally an increasing common stock valuation applied to new grants 
the increase for the year ended december  was partially offset by an additional stock based compensation charge of million recognized during the year ended december   which reflected a correction of stock based compensation expense that should have been recorded during the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  an increase from million for the year ended december  the million increase in our selling  general and administrative expenses during the year ended december  consisted primarily of a million increase in stock based compensation expense related to a larger number of outstanding equity awards  expense related to performance based awards  an increasing common stock valuation applied to new grants made in  and an additional stock based compensation charge of million which reflected a correction of stock based compensation expense that should have been recorded during the year ended december   a million increase in employee cash compensation expenses related to higher sales and marketing headcount to support a larger number of stores in the united states and europe and higher general and administrative headcount to support the expansion of the business  a million increase in office  information technology and facilities related costs to support the growth of our business  including the opening of new stores and service locations and our transition to our palo alto headquarters  a million increase in travel and expenses related to our sales and marketing activities  and a million increase in professional services costs related to ongoing trademark and patent work  recruiting  as well as general corporate development activities 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in future periods as we continue to grow and expand our operations  increase our sales and marketing activities to handle our expanding market presence and prepare for the planned model s commercial launch by july  and as we support the requirements of being a public company 
we plan to open additional stores and service centers during  mostly in the united states  and some of these stores will replace existing stores  which we may continue to use as service locations 
interest expense our interest expense is primarily due to our loans under the doe loan facility which we began accessing in although interest expense will increase as we continue to draw down on the doe loan facility to fund our model s and powertrain activities  we expect to capitalize this interest to construction in progress until the start of model s production 
during the years ended december  and  we capitalized million and million  respectively  of interest expense to construction in progress 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million  a decrease from million for the year ended december  interest expense during the year ended december  was primarily related to our convertible notes which were converted into shares of our series e convertible preferred stock in may  while interest expense during the year ended december  was primarily due to our loans under the doe loan facility which we began accessing in other expense  net other expense  net consists primarily of the change in the fair value of our warrant liabilities and transaction gains and losses on our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
we expect our transaction gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in the underlying exchange rates 
income or charges resulting from 
table of contents the change in the fair value of our convertible preferred stock warrant liability  excluding the doe warrant liability  was eliminated after july   as these warrants were net exercised at the completion of our ipo 
the doe convertible preferred stock warrant which we issued in january  became a common stock warrant on july  and is carried at its estimated fair value with changes in its fair value continuing to be reflected in other expense  net  until its expiration or vesting 
other expense  net  for the year ended december  was million  a decrease from other expense  net  of million for the year ended december  the decrease in expense for the year ended december  was primarily due to the elimination of warrant liabilities  excluding the doe warrant liability  upon the completion of our ipo in july other expense  net  for the year ended december  was million  an increase in expense compared to other expense  net  of million for the year ended december  the increase in expense for the year ended december  was primarily due to the fair value changes in our warrant liabilities as well as the liability related to common stock warrants to certain of our stockholders which we issued in may  both of which increased significantly in conjunction with the increase in our common stock valuation 
provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was million  an increase from million for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to the increase in taxable income in our international jurisdictions 
our provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was million  an increase from  for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to the launch of the tesla roadster in europe in july and the ensuing increase in taxable income in our international jurisdictions 
liquidity and capital resources since inception and through the year ended december   we had accumulated net operating losses of million and have used million of cash in operations 
as of december   we had million in principal sources of liquidity available from our cash and cash equivalents  short term marketable securities  cash held in our dedicated doe account and the remaining amounts available under the doe loan facility 
this includes our cash and cash equivalents in the amount of million which included investments in money market funds  our short term marketable securities in the amount of million  cash of million deposited in a dedicated doe account in accordance with the requirements of our doe loan facility  and approximately million available under the doe loan facility  which is primarily intended to cover spending related to the development of model s and our powertrain activities 
other sources of cash also include cash from the sales of the tesla roadster  cash from the provision of development services  sales of powertrain components and refundable reservation payments for our model s 
we expect that our current sources of liquidity  including cash  cash equivalents  short term marketable securities  cash held in our dedicated doe account and the remaining amounts available under the doe loan facility  together with our anticipated cash from operating activities will provide us adequate liquidity until we reach profitability in this capital will fund our ongoing operations  continue research and development projects  establish sales and service centers  improve infrastructure such as expanded battery pack assembly facilities  and to make the investments in tooling and manufacturing capital required to introduce model s and to continue development of model x 
the acceleration of the development of future vehicles  investments in new technologies  increased in sourcing of manufacturing capabilities  investments to expand our powertrain activities or further expand our sales and service network  may require us to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity  equity related or debt securities or through obtaining credit 
we may also choose to opportunistically raise additional funds if market conditions are favorable 
we cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required  or at all 

table of contents doe loan facility on january   we entered into a loan facility with the federal financing bank ffb  and the doe  pursuant to the advanced technology vehicles manufacturing atvm incentive program such loan facility  including amendments thereto  the doe loan facility 
under the doe loan facility  the ffb has made available to us two multi draw term loan facilities in an aggregate principal amount of up to million 
up to an aggregate principal amount of million will be made available under the first term loan facility to finance up to of the costs eligible for funding for the powertrain engineering and the build out of a facility to design and manufacture lithium ion battery packs  electric motors and electric components the powertrain facility 
up to an aggregate principal amount of million will be made available under the second term loan facility to finance up to of the costs eligible for funding for the development of  and to build out the manufacturing facility for  our model s sedan the model s facility 
under the doe loan facility  we are responsible for the remaining of the costs eligible for funding under the atvm program for the projects as well as any cost overruns for each project 
our doe loan facility draw downs were as follows in thousands loan facility available for future draw downs interest rates beginning balance  january  draw downs received during the three months ended march  draw downs received during the three months ended june  draw downs received during the three months ended september  draw downs received during the three months ended december  remaining balance  december  draw downs received during the three months ended march  draw downs received during the three months ended june  draw downs received during the three months ended september  draw downs received during the three months ended december  remaining balance  december  in february  we received additional loans under the doe loan facility of million at interest rates ranging from to 
we have agreed that  in connection with the sale of our stock in any follow on equity offering  at least of the net offering proceeds will be received by us 
offering proceeds may not be used to pay bonuses or other compensation to officers  directors  employees or consultants in excess of the amounts contemplated by our business plan approved by the doe 
upon completion of our ipo in  we set aside million to fund a separate dedicated account under our doe loan facility 
this dedicated account is used by us to fund any cost overruns for our powertrain and tesla factory projects and is used as a mechanism to defer advances under the doe loan facility 
this will not affect our ability to draw down the full amount of the doe loans  but will require us to use the dedicated account 
table of contents to fund certain project costs upfront  which costs may then be reimbursed by loans under the doe loan facility once the dedicated account is depleted  or as part of the final advance for the applicable project 
we will be then required to deposit a portion of these reimbursements into the dedicated account  in an amount equal to up to of the remaining project costs for the applicable project  and these amounts may similarly be used by us to fund project costs and cost overruns and will similarly be eligible for reimbursement by the draw down of additional loans under the doe loan facility once used in full  or as part of the final advance for the applicable project 
depending on the timing and magnitude of our draw downs and the funding requirements of the dedicated account  the balance of the dedicated account will fluctuate throughout the period in which we plan to make draw downs under the doe loan facility 
upon completion of our final advance under the doe loan facility  the balance in the dedicated account will be fully transferred out of the dedicated account 
as of december  and  million and million were held in the dedicated account  respectively
