vendor allowances totaled billion in  billion in and billion in vendor allowances can be grouped into the following broad categories promotional allowances  slotting allowances and contract allowances 
promotional allowances make up more than of all allowances 
with promotional allowances  vendors pay safeway to promote their product 
the promotion may be any combination of a temporary price reduction  a feature in print ads  a feature in a safeway circular or a preferred location in the store 
the promotions are typically one to two weeks long 
slotting allowances are a small portion of total allowances approximately of all allowances 
with slotting allowances  the vendor reimburses safeway for the cost of placing new product on the shelf 
safeway has no obligation or commitment to keep the product on the shelf for a minimum period 
contract allowances make up the remainder of all allowances 
under a typical contract allowance  a vendor pays safeway to keep product on the shelf for a minimum period of time or when volume thresholds are achieved 
promotional and slotting allowances are accounted for as a reduction in the cost of purchased inventory and recognized when the related inventory is sold 
contract allowances are recognized as a reduction in the cost of goods sold as volume thresholds are achieved or through the passage of time

the tax expense reflects the tax effect of the goodwill impairment charge which is largely nondeductible for income tax purposes and  therefore  increases the company s effective income tax rate 
the impact of the goodwill impairment charge on the tax expense was partly offset by a benefit of million from the favorable resolution of various tax matters 
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that management believes are important to the portrayal of safeway s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
workers compensation the company is primarily self insured for workers compensation  automobile and general liability costs 
it is the company s policy to record its self insurance liability as determined actuarially  based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
self insurance reserves are actuarially determined primarily by applying historical paid loss and incurred loss development trends to current cash and incurred expected losses in order to estimate total losses 
we then discount total expected losses to their present value using a risk free rate of return 
any actuarial projection of self insured losses is subject to a high degree of variability 
for example  self insurance expense was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in litigation trends  legal interpretations  benefit level changes  claim settlement patterns and similar factors influenced historical development trends that were used to determine the current year expense and therefore contributed to the variability in annual expense 
however  these factors are not direct inputs into the actuarial projection  and thus their individual impact cannot be quantified 
the discount rate is a significant factor that has led to variability in self insured expenses 
since the discount rate is a direct input into the estimation process  we are able to quantify its impact 
the discount rate  which is based on the united states treasury note rates for the estimated average claim life of five years  was in  in and in a basis point change in the discount rate affects the self insured liability between million and million 
the majority of the company s workers compensation liability is from claims occurring in california 
california workers compensation has received intense scrutiny from the state s politicians  insurers  employers and providers  as well as the public in general 
recent years have seen escalation in the number of legislative reforms  judicial rulings and social phenomena affecting this business

store lease exit costs and impairment charges safeway assesses store impairment quarterly 
safeway s policy is to recognize losses relating to the impairment of long lived assets when expected net future cash flows are less than the assets carrying values 
when stores that are under long term leases close  safeway records a liability for the future minimum lease payments and related ancillary costs  net of estimated cost recoveries 
in both cases  fair value is determined by estimating net future cash flows and discounting them using a risk adjusted rate of interest 
the company estimates future cash flows based on its experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is located and  when necessary  uses real estate brokers 
however  these estimates project future cash flows several years into the future and are affected by factors such as inflation  real estate markets and economic conditions 
at any one time  safeway has a portfolio of closed stores which is widely dispersed over several markets 
while individual closed store reserves are likely to be adjusted up or down in the future to reflect changes in assumptions  the change to the total closed store reserve has not been nor is expected to be material 
employee benefit plans the company recognizes in its balance sheet a liability for the underfunded status of its employee benefit plans 
the company measures plan assets and obligations that determine the funded status as of fiscal year end 
additional disclosures are provided in note k to the consolidated financial statements  set forth in part ii  item of this report 
the determination of safeway s obligation and expense for pension benefits is dependent  in part  on the company s selection of certain assumptions used by its actuaries in calculating these amounts 
these assumptions are disclosed in note k to the consolidated financial statements and include  among other things  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rate of compensation increases 
actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  the amount by which actual results differ from the actuarial assumptions is accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  affects recognized expense in such future periods 
while safeway believes its assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in actual results or significant changes in the company s assumptions may materially affect safeway s pension and other postretirement obligations and its future expense 
safeway bases the discount rate on current investment yields on high quality fixed income investments 
the discount rate assumption used to determine the year end projected benefit obligation is increased or decreased to be consistent with the change in yield rates for high quality fixed income investments for the expected period to maturity of the pension benefits 
the discount rate used to determine pension expense was 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
expected return on pension plan assets is based on historical experience of the company s portfolio and the review of projected returns by asset class on broad  publicly traded equity and fixed income indices  as well as target asset allocation 
safeway s target asset allocation mix is designed to meet the company s long term pension requirements 
for  the company s assumed rate of return was on us pension assets and on canadian pension assets 
for  the company s assumed rate of return is on u 
s pension assets and on canadian pension assets 
over the year period ended december   the average rate of return was approximately for us and for canadian pension assets 
the deteriorating conditions in the global financial markets during led to a substantial reduction in the year average rate of return on pension assets 
we expect that the markets will eventually recover to our assumed long term rate of return

these audits may challenge certain of the company s tax positions such as the timing and amount of income and deductions and the allocation of taxable income to various tax jurisdictions 
the company evaluates its tax positions and establishes liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes 
these tax uncertainties are reviewed as facts and circumstances change and are adjusted accordingly 
this requires significant management judgment in estimating final outcomes
