current trends and recent developments for the company overview we supply technology based products utilizing our portable digital video and audio recording capabilities  for the law enforcement and security industries and for the commercial fleet and mass transit markets 
we have the ability to integrate electronic  radio  computer  mechanical  and multi media technologies to create unique solutions to our customers requests 
we began shipping our flagship digital video mirror in march we have developed additional products to complement our dvm and dvm in car video products including lower priced in car video mirrors the dvm and dvm speed detection laser ally and body worn camera firstvu products designed for law enforcement usage 
furthermore  we have launched a new line of digital video mirrors the dvm and dvm plus that serve as event recorders for the commercial fleet and mass transit markets that expands our customer base beyond the traditional law enforcement agencies 
we have additional research and development projects that we anticipate will result in several new product launches during we believe that the launch of these new products will help to diversify and increase our product offerings and we anticipate that such new products will result in increased revenues in the future 
we experienced a negative trend in our operating results in and and have reported operating losses during each of the previous eight fiscal quarters 
the following is a summary of our recent operating results on a quarterly basis for the three months ended december  september  june  march  december  september  june  march  total revenue gross profit gross profit margin percentage total selling  general and administrative expenses operating loss operating margin percentage net loss our business is subject to substantial fluctuations on a quarterly basis as reflected in the significant variations in revenues and operating results in the above table 
these variations result from the timing of large individual orders particularly from international customers and our new products  such as the dvm  dvm and dvm we incurred an operating loss during fourth quarter of  on revenues of  compared to an operating loss of  on total revenues of  the third quarter our revenues declined substantially in fourth quarter compared to the first  second  and third quarters of  which contributed to our increased operating loss of  compared to operating losses of  for third quarter   for second quarter  and  for first quarter our gross margin percentage decreased to compared to in third quarter  but improved slightly compared to in second quarter and in first quarter the reduction in gross margin percentage also contributed to the increased operating loss in fourth quarter compared to third quarter we decreased our selling  general and administrative sg a expenses each quarter in compared to each quarter in as we implemented our cost reduction and containment initiative  which resulted in approximately million in sg a cost savings per quarter 
our international revenues during improved over levels as we shipped international orders totaling  in  compared to  during we expect to continue to experience significant fluctuations in revenues in and beyond due to the timing of larger orders particularly from international customers 
for  we are focusing on increasing revenues and improving gross margins on sales in addition to continuing our general and administrative cost reduction and containment measures 
we plan  however  to continue to invest in research  development  sales and marketing resources on a prudent basis 
inventory levels declined significantly during as we sold inventory  decreased production rates and reduced procurement throughout our supply chain 
this reversed our trend when we experienced a general increase in inventory levels in anticipation of higher sales that did not materialize  particularly from international customers 
there have been a number of factors trends affecting our recent performance  which include we experienced lower than expected revenues during each quarter of due in part to the challenging economy  which has negatively impacted state  county and municipal budgets upon which our law enforcement customers are dependent 
we expect that the current economic climate will continue to depress certain state and local tax bases  and may continue to make a challenging business environment 
we incurred a non cash charge of  in fourth quarter related to an increase in the valuation reserve on deferred tax assets  which resulted in a net loss of  for fourth quarter as described in note  income taxes  to the financial statements in this annual report 
we have increased the valuation reserve by an additional  during the year ended december  we expect to maintain a full valuation allowance until we determine that we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to realize these assets 
to the extent we determine that the realization of some or all of these benefits is more likely than not  based upon expected future taxable income  a portion or all of the valuation allowance will be reversed 
such a reversal would be recorded as an income tax benefit and  for some portion related to deductions for stock option exercises  an increase in shareholders equity 
our gross profit on sales dropped to during fourth quarter reversing the positive quarter we experienced in third quarter when our gross profit was 
our gross profit was in second quarter and in first quarter we implemented a printed circuit board revision during fourth quarter that resulted in the replacement of all older version boards in our dvm inventory 
the cost of the labor  overhead and material to accomplish this replacement of boards was charged to cost of sales during fourth quarter and resulted in a significant decrease in our gross margin percentage 
we expect to achieve improved margins during because of our supply chain initiative  reduced manufacturing overhead  increases in sales volume and product mix 
we continue to focus on reducing the costs of our products through changes to our supply chain whereby we are emphasizing outsourcing of component part production and changing our supply chain vendors to lower cost alternatives suppliers throughout the world 
we have reduced our inventory levels throughout through our sales and began to see the effects of our supply chain improvements in third quarter as we shipped current orders in particular for the dvm plus that were manufactured during using components from our new supply chain 
in addition  our sales mix improved gross margins during third quarter as we shipped significant orders of our newer products  such as the dvm and dvm these newer products yield higher margins than our traditional in car video systems 
we implemented our supply chain plan in to improve gross margins through better outsourcing of our component parts in the future  including foreign sources  which has allowed us to reduce our production overhead costs through headcount and other cost reductions 
however  we are experiencing increased price competition and pressure from certain of our competitors that has led to pricing discounts on larger contract opportunities 
we believe this pricing pressure will continue as our competitors attempt to regain market share and revive sales and expect it to have a negative impact on our gross margins to some degree 
we believe that current and potential customers may be delaying or reducing the size of orders due to a number of factors  including budget reductions  in order to preserve their currently available funding and budgets 
many of the existing federal funding programs require matching funds from the local agencies that continues to be difficult given the budget restrictions 
we cannot predict whether such funding on a matching basis will have a positive impact on our revenues in the future 
our international revenues improved in fiscal  with total international revenues of  of total revenues compared to  of total revenues for during march  we received and shipped an order from a governmental agency in mexico for dvm units valued in excess of  during third quarter  we shipped several significant orders to customers in central america and the previously announced order to the turkish gendarmerie that contributed to the improvement in international revenues 
we experienced an increase in inquiries and bid activity from international customers in late  however  international sale cycles generally take longer than domestic business 
we also believe that our new products may appeal to international customers  in particular the dvm and dvm we have built in capability to install a variety of language packs into our dvm system  which currently includes english  spanish  turkish and arabic  with additional languages to become available in this language flexibility may be a positive factor in our efforts to improve future international sales 
since the fourth quarter  we have reduced selling general and administrative costs sg a and improved gross margins and undertaken headcount reductions and other cost reduction and containment measures 
in that regard  our total sg a expenses declined approximately million and we reduced production overhead expenses by approximately  during compared to despite the improvement in sg a and production overhead expenses  our revenues decreased million during compared to  which served to offset the benefits of such cost reductions 
we will continue to make specific but smaller headcount reductions and implement other cost reduction and containment measures during we have reorganized our production and manufacturing operations by placing a greater emphasis on contract manufacturers 
uncertainties regarding the size and timing of large international orders make it difficult for us to maintain efficient production and staffing levels if all orders are processed through our manufacturing facility 
by outsourcing more of our production requirements to contract manufacturers  we believe that we can benefit from greater volume purchasing and production efficiencies  while at the same time reducing our fixed and semi fixed overhead costs 
it is  of course  important that selected contract manufacturers be able to ramp up production quickly in order to meet the varying demands of our international customers 
we have developed additional products to complement our dvm and dvm in car video products 
in that respect  we launched the laser ally speed detection system in third quarter  the thermal ally night vision system in fourth quarter  the dvm event recorder during first quarter  the dvm in car video system in third quarter and the dvm in car video system in fourth quarter we are hopeful that our expanded product line will help generate incremental revenues to supplement our traditional dvm plus and dvm revenues 
in addition  the dvm event recorder is designed for commercial fleet operators  which will allow us to seek new customers outside of law enforcement 
our recent operating losses caused deterioration in our cash and liquidity in and we borrowed  under two unsecured subordinated notes payable to a private  third party lender 
the notes are due and payable in full on may  and may be prepaid without penalty at any time 
we utilized the proceeds to retire our bank line of credit and provide cash for operations 
we had no institutional credit lines available to provide working capital as of december  at december   we had available cash balances of  and approximately million of working capital primarily in the form of inventory and accounts receivable 
we focused on reducing inventory and accounts receivable levels to generate additional liquidity and improve our cash position during in that regard we have reduced our inventory and accounts receivable levels by approximately million and million  respectively  during fiscal compared to december  during the year ended december   we borrowed an aggregate of million in two separate transactions under two unsecured notes payable to a private  third party lender 
the loans are represented by two promissory notes the notes in the principal amounts of  and  that bear interest at the rate of per annum and are payable interest only on a monthly basis 
in november  we extended the maturity date of the  note from may  to may   which made both notes due and payable in full on may  they may be prepaid without penalty at any time and are subordinated to all existing and future senior indebtedness  as such term is defined in the notes 

we may seek additional credit facilities to complement the notes and provide us with funding should the need arise to finance growth or other expenditures 
our existing notes are unsecured and do not prevent us from obtaining senior secured financing should we find it necessary 
however  we expect that it will be difficult for us to obtain a new line of credit facility given our recent operating losses and the current banking environment 
any new credit facility  if obtained  may not be on terms favorable to us 
we do not consider raising capital through an equity offering to be a viable alternative to supplement working capital needs  given our current public equity valuation 
however  we may find it necessary to raise additional capital if we do not regain profitability during  are unable to improve liquidity through a reduction in our inventory and accounts receivable levels in the near term and do not have other means to support our planned operating activities 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet debt nor did we have any transactions  arrangements  obligations including contingent obligations or other relationships with any unconsolidated entities or other persons that may have material current or future effect on financial conditions  changes in the financial conditions  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  capital resources  or significant components of revenue or expenses 
we are a party to operating leases and license agreements that represent commitments for future payments described in note to our consolidated financial statements and we have issued purchase orders in the ordinary course of business that represent commitments to future payments for goods and services 
we are contingently liable as of december  for standby letters of credit issued by enterprise bank for an aggregate amount of  to certain customers as security if we do not honor our contractual warranty obligations on the products delivered to such customers 
the outstanding standby letters expire in may we have never had a beneficiary demand funding related to such standby letters of credit 
we entered into a supply and distribution agreement on may  under which we were granted the exclusive worldwide right to sell and distribute a proprietary law enforcement speed measurement device and derivatives to its customers 
the term of the agreement was months after the date the supplier began full scale production of the product  which commenced in august  and final certification of the product was obtained  which was in august  the agreement had minimum purchase requirements of  units per period over three commitment periods 
on january   the parties amended the agreement to reduce the minimum purchase commitments over the second and third years by compared to the original commitment  or to approximately  from january  through its expiration in february 
we agreed to release our world wide right to exclusively market the product to the law enforcement market in exchange for the reduction in the purchase commitment 
after the initial term has expired  the parties may continue on a month to month basis and is terminable by either party upon days advance notice 
the contract may be terminated earlier in case of material breach by either party that is not cured within thirty days of notice of the breach 
the agreement contains required minimum order quantities and fixed prices per unit according to the following schedule minimum order commitment amount commitment time period commitment purchases remaining commitment august through february march through february march through february the company holds approximately  of such products in finished goods inventory as of december  for the years ended december  and results of operations summarized immediately below and discussed in more detail in the subsequent sub sections is an analysis of our operating results for the years ended december  and  represented as a percentage of total revenues for each respective year years ended december  revenue cost of revenue gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expense selling  advertising and promotional expense stock based compensation expense general and administrative expense total selling  general and administrative expenses operating loss interest income expense loss before income tax benefit income tax provision net loss net loss per share information basic diluted revenues our current product offerings include the following product description retail price dvm plus an in car digital audio video system that is integrated into a rear view mirror primarily designed for law enforcement customers 
dvm ultra an all weather mobile digital audio video system that is designed for motorcycle  atv and boat users mirror primarily for law enforcement customers 
dvm an in car digital audio video system that is integrated into a rear view mirror primarily designed for law enforcement customers 
dvf a digital audio video system that is integrated into a law enforcement style flashlight primarily designed for law enforcement customers 
dvm an in car digital audio video system that is integrated into a rear view mirror primarily designed for law enforcement customers 
this system uses an integrated fixed focus camera 
dvm an in car digital audio video system that is integrated into a rear view mirror primarily designed for law enforcement customers 
this system uses an external zoom camera 
dvm an in car digital audio video system that is integrated into a rear view mirror primarily designed for commercial fleet customers 
we also offer the dvm plus which has additional features and retails for thermal ally a hand held thermal imaging camera that improves night vision or other low light situations primarily designed for law enforcement customers 
laser ally a hand held mobile speed detection and measurement device that uses light beams rather than sound waves to measure the speed of vehicles 
firstvu a body worn digital audio video camera system primarily designed for law enforcement customers 
the company sells its products and services to law enforcement and commercial customers in the following manner sales to domestic and international customers are made direct to the end customer typically a law enforcement agency or a commercial customer through commissioned third party sales agents or our direct sales force digital ally employees 
revenue is recorded when the product is shipped to the end customer 
sales to domestic and international customers are made through independent distributors who purchase products from the company at a wholesale price and sell to the end user typically law enforcement agencies or a commercial customer at a retail price 
the distributor retains the margin as its compensation for their role in the transaction 
the distributor generally maintains product inventory  customer receivables and all related risks and rewards of ownership 
revenue is recorded when the product is shipped to the distributor consistent with the terms of the distribution agreement 
repair parts and services for domestic and international customers are generally handled by our inside customer service employees 
revenue is recognized upon shipment of the repair parts and acceptance of the service or materials by the end customer 
we may discount our prices on specific orders when considering the size of the order  the specific customer and the competitive landscape 
we believe that our systems are cost competitive compared to our primary competition and generally are lower priced when considering comparable features and capabilities 
we sold a total of  and  dvm units during the year ended december  and  respectively 
our dvm and dvm plus models on a combined basis represented approximately and of total unit sales during the year ended december  and  respectively 
we stopped selling the legacy dvm in january revenues for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively  a decrease of   due to the following factors we experienced a decrease in revenues due to the challenging economy that negatively impacted state  county and municipal budgets which fund our law enforcement customers 
we believe that current and potential customers may have delayed or reduced the size of their orders due to a number of factors  including their local budget reductions and anticipation of receiving the federal government s stimulus funds in order to preserve their currently available funding and budgets 
our average order size decreased from approximately  in the year ended december  to  during the year ended december  we shipped orders in excess of  for a total of  in revenue  in the year ended december  compared to orders individually in excess of  for total revenue of approximately million  in the year ended december  we believe that this reflects reduced law enforcement budgets where the customers are covering only the minimum required needs rather than full fleet deployments 
in addition  the new products we introduced in and firstvu  laser ally  thermal ally  dvm and dvm all have lower average selling prices than our digital video mirror lines 
repair orders at lower average invoice amounts have also increased as our installed base continues to come off of warranty 
these repair orders are at lower average price levels and are impacting our overall average invoice size 
we are hopeful that in will see an easing of such budgetary constraints and that purchasing patterns will resume at their former  higher levels  although we can make no assurances in this regard 
our international revenues increased to  representing of total revenues  during the year ended december  compared to  representing of total revenues  during the year ended december  despite the improvement in international revenues  such revenues are substantially less than our expectations 
sales to certain countries that were strong revenue sources for us historically were negatively impacted by political and social unrest  economic recession and a weakening of their currency exchange rate versus the us dollar 
during the third quarter we shipped several significant orders to customers in central america and the previously announced order to the turkish gendarmerie that contributed to the improvement in international revenues 
we had an increase in inquiries and bid activity from international customers in late  however  international sale cycles generally take longer than domestic business 
we also believe that our new products may appeal to international customers  in particular the dvm  dvm and dvm  which could generate additional international revenues for the balance of and we have been reorganizing our domestic sales force and organization for our law enforcement channel since late traditionally  we have emphasized the usage of third party sales agents to market our law enforcement products 
we believe that type of sales force was effective and efficient for us when we initially entered the market with a new product 
we are now changing principally to an employee direct sales force that provides us with more control and monitoring of our sales agents and their activities 
in addition  we have reduced the size of certain sales territories and consequently increased the overall number of our salesmen to improve our penetration of all markets 
we believe this new model will encourage salesmen in lower performing territories to improve their efforts and sales 
we also believe that a portion of the revenue decrease experienced in revenues resulted from third party sales agents reducing their sales efforts because they did not have the financial resources to travel  meet and market directly to their customers 
we maintained consistent retail pricing on our law enforcement mirror models during and do not plan any material changes in pricing during including the new products recently introduced 
our newer mirror based products include the dvm and the dvm  which will be sold at lower retail pricing levels compared to our legacy products during due to fewer features 
we are  however  experiencing some price competition and discounting from our competitors as they attempt to regain market share 
for certain opportunities that involve multiple units and or multi year contracts we have occasionally discounted our products to gain or retain market share and revenues 
cost of revenue cost of revenue on units sold for the year ended december  and was  and  respectively  a decrease of  
the decrease in costs of goods sold is primarily due to the decrease in revenues during the year ended december  compared to  offset by an increase in the cost of goods sold as a percent of revenues 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased to during the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  our goal is to reduce cost of sales as a percentage of revenues to during and beyond 
the cost of wireless transmission modules wtms substantially increased our cost of sales during as we upgraded many existing and new customers to a new wtm solution  which was substantially more costly than our previous solution 
we were unable to pass the increased cost on to our customers for this wtm upgrade  which negatively impacted our cost of sales 
our manufacturing overhead rates also increased during  primarily due to the slowing of production rates to allow for the reduction of overall inventory levels 
improving gross margins through reductions in conversion costs engineering changes and rework and manufacturing inefficiencies related to our base products  such as the dvm and dvm plus  are main focuses of management and engineering at the current time 
we implemented a printed circuit board revision during the fourth quarter of that resulted in the replacement of all older version boards in our dvm inventory 
the cost of the labor  overhead and material to accomplish this replacement of boards was charged to cost of sales during and resulted in a significant decrease in our gross margin percentage 
in addition  we continue to reorganize our production and manufacturing operations by placing a greater emphasis upon contract manufacturers  including those located offshore 
uncertainties regarding the size and timing of large international orders make it difficult for us to maintain efficient production and staffing levels if all orders are processed through our manufacturing facility 
by outsourcing more of our production requirements to contract manufacturers  we believe that we can benefit from greater volume purchasing and production efficiencies  while at the same time reducing our fixed and semi fixed overhead costs 
we believe that the selected contract manufacturers will be able to ramp up production quickly in order to meet the varying demands of our international customers 
we expect that our newer product offerings  in particular the dvm  dvm and dvm  should improve our cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales during we do not expect to incur significant capital expenditures to ramp up production of the new products because our internal process is largely assembling subcomponents  testing and shipping of completed products or we use contract manufacturers 
we rely on our subcontractors to produce finished circuit boards that represent the primary components of our products  thereby reducing our need to purchase capital equipment 
we had  and  in reserves for obsolete and excess inventories at december  and december   respectively 
we had no remaining units of the legacy dvm units in finished goods at december  and have discontinued it 
we are maintaining component parts specific to the legacy dvm in inventory at levels reasonably expected to be consumed for service and repair demands 
total raw materials and component parts were  and  at december  and december   respectively  a decrease of  
the decrease in raw materials and component parts reflects our focus on the reduction of overall inventory levels in to improve our liquidity position 
we believe that introduction of new parties to our supply chain will continue to help reduce cost of sales as a percent of revenues during finished goods balances were  and  at december  and december   respectively  a decrease of  
the decrease in finished goods was primarily in the dvm plus products because we focused on reducing overall inventory levels to improve our liquidity position 
finished goods at december  are primarily in the dvm  the dvm plus and laser ally  products which will be used to fulfill international and domestic orders during finished goods also included supplies of our other new products  including the firstvu  thermal ally  dvm  dvm and dvm at december  the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory as a percent of total inventory balances increased to as of december  compared to at december  we believe that our obsolescence risk was less at december  compared to december  because we have no remaining dvm legacy systems in finished goods inventory and the increased reserve as a percentage of total gross inventory balances 
we believe these reserves are appropriate given our inventory levels at december  gross profit gross profit for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively  a decrease of  
the significant decrease is commensurate with the decline in revenues and increase in cost of revenues as a percent of sales that we experienced during the year ended december  compared to our gross profit percentage decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  we expect that our margins will improve based upon the expected margins of our new products  in particular the dvm  dvm and dvm  if we gain traction in the marketplace and increase commercial production during in addition  as revenues increase from these products  we will seek to further improve our margins from these new products through economies of scale and more effectively utilizing fixed manufacturing overhead components 
we plan to concentrate on more efficient management of our supply chain through outsourcing production  quantity purchases and more effective purchasing practices 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of  
overall selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales remained at in and the significant components of selling  general and administrative expenses are as follows year ended december  research and development expense selling  advertising and promotional expense stock based compensation expense professional fees and expense executive  sales and administrative staff payroll other total research and development expense 
we continue to focus on bringing new products to market  including updates and improvements to current products 
our research and development expenses totaled  and  for the year ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of  
we believe that our cost trends have improved substantially in the year ended december  because of our cost containment efforts and increased scrutiny of engineering resources by our vice president of engineering 
his efforts have greatly improved the development cycle and costs associated with our new products  including line extensions for our current products that we plan to bring to market in the future 
we employed a total of engineers at december   most of whom are dedicated to research and development activities for new products 
research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues were in and in  illustrating our continuing commitment to bring new products to market and expanding our current product line 
we have active research and development projects on several new products  as well as upgrades to our existing product lines 
during first quarter  we introduced the dvm event recorder  which is targeting commercial fleet operators  the dvm in third quarter and the dvm in fourth quarter the dvm  firstvu  dvm  dvm and dvm products are the result of our current research and development efforts 
we purchase and resell the thermal ally and laser ally products under our name from third parties who developed them 
the number of engineers devoted to research and development activities is expected to increase during because we have several development projects in process that are expected to be completed and launched in we consider our research and development capabilities and new product focus to be a competitive advantage and will continue to invest in this area on a prudent basis 
selling  advertising and promotional expenses 
selling  advertising and promotional expense totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of   which is commensurate with the decrease in revenues 
the largest component of selling  promotional and advertising expense is commissions paid to our independent agents who represent our sales force in the domestic market 
these agents generally receive a commission on sales ranging from to of the gross sales price to the end customer 
sales commissions totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of   which is commensurate with the sales decrease in compared to  offset by the costs of reorganizing our law enforcement sales agents and the establishment of our direct sales force to address the sale of the our new dvm product through the commercial fleet sales channel 
sales commissions increased during by costs associated with the restructuring of our sales agents within our law enforcement sales channel and the new salesmen hired to launch the new dvm product line 
we have changed sales agents in four territories for our law enforcement sales channel and have hired five new salesmen focused on the dvm sales launch  which represents our new commercial sales channel 
sales commissions as a percentage of overall sales increased to during the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december promotional and advertising expenses totaled  during the years ended december  compared to  during the year ended december   a decrease of  
the decrease is attributable to our cost containment and reduction initiative during  which resulted in a reduction in our attendance at trade shows particularly at international venues 
we expect increases in expenses for brochures and other marketing initiatives designed to help launch the dvm event recorder  the dvm and the dvm during stock based compensation expense 
stock based compensation expense totaled  and  for the year ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of  
the decrease was primarily attributable to stock options issued in january to officers with longer four year vesting periods compared to the restricted stock grant to officers in january with shorter one year vesting periods 
the longer amortization period related to such stock option grants in january resulted in reduced stock based compensation expense in the year ended december  compared to we expect this trend to continue during professional fees and expense 
professional fees and expenses totaled  and  for the year ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of  
professional fees during were related primarily to normal public company matters  intellectual property matters and litigation matters 
the decrease in professional fees and expenses is primarily attributable to the company s cost containment measures coupled with the settlement of certain litigation 
we expect increased legal research and consultation regarding several patents and trademarks that have been or may be filed on the company s new products and litigation expense during executive  sales and administrative staff payroll 
executive  sales and administrative staff payroll expenses totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of  
this decrease is attributable to the cost containment initiative that resulted in headcount reductions  including the elimination of the vice president of operations position during january the base salaries of our officers were reduced by at least effective january   which contributed to the reduction in executive payroll costs 
severance costs charged to executive  sales and administrative payroll exceeded  during the year ended december   which offset the overall decrease in such payroll costs 
management anticipates that the reduction in executive  sales and administrative payroll will continue during as the full benefit of the headcount reductions are is realized 
however  such reductions may be offset partially because we may find it necessary to hire additional technical support staff during to handle field inquiries  wireless download and installation matters as our installed customer base continues to increase and additional technical support is required for our new products  such as the dvm  dvm and dvm other 
other selling  general and administrative expenses totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of  
the decrease in was attributable to substantial increases in our overall insurance expense offset by our cost containment measures that generally reduced the cost of information technology  telephone and internet services as we negotiated better contracts rates or moved to new service providers 
we decreased the amount of leased space for our engineering and distribution departments effective june   which contributed to the reductions in property insurance and facility related expenses 
we plan to continue our cost containment initiatives for and expect the improvement in our overhead costs will continue 
operating loss for the reasons previously stated  our operating loss was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  an improvement of  
operating loss as a percentage of revenues increased to in compared to in interest income interest income decreased to  in the year ended december  from  in the decrease in interest income was a result of our decreased average cash balances and significantly lower average interest rate earned on such balances during the year ended december  compared to interest expense we incurred interest expense of  and  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
we began drawing on our line of credit during the third quarter to fund our operating losses and the repurchase of  of common stock during we issued a note in the principal amount of million during second quarter  the proceeds of which were used to repay the outstanding line of credit 
we issued another note in the principal amount of million in fourth quarter and extended the maturity date of the first note such that both notes are due and payable in full on may  the notes payable bear interest at per annum and can be prepaid at any time without penalty 
in conjunction with the issuance of these notes during  we issued a total of  warrants to purchase common stock with an exercise price of per share until november  the estimated value of these warrants is reflected as a discount on the related notes payable and is amortized to interest expense ratably over the term of the notes 
the outstanding balance on our notes was million as of december   less the unamortized discount of  loss on debt extinguishment during november  we extended the maturity date of the million note issued in may and issued a second note for million under the same terms 
the modification of the original note payable was treated as an early extinguishment of the debt 
accordingly  the remaining unamortized discount as of the date of modification  was charged off and reflected as a loss on extinguishment of debt in the statement of operations 
loss before income tax benefit as a result of the above  we reported a loss before income tax benefit of  and  for the year ended december  and  respectively  a deterioration of  
income tax benefit our income tax provision was  for the year ended december  we recorded no income tax benefit related to our losses for the year ended december  due to management s decision to continue providing a full valuation reserve on our net deferred tax assets as of december  we incurred significant operating losses in that placed us in a three year cumulative loss position at december   despite the improvement in general economic conditions and our ongoing cost containment efforts 
accordingly  we determined there was not sufficient positive evidence regarding our potential for future profits to outweigh the negative evidence of our three year cumulative loss position under the applicable accounting guidance 
therefore  we determined that our valuation allowance should be increased to  to fully reserve our deferred tax assets at december  during  we continued to incur operating losses which provides a basis to continue to fully reserve our deferred tax assets as of december  therefore  the valuation reserve has been increased to  as of december  which provides a full reserve on all deferred tax assets 
we expect to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance until we determine that we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to realize these assets 
to the extent we determine that the realization of some or all of these benefits is more likely than not based upon expected future taxable income  a portion or all of the valuation allowance will be reversed 
such a reversal would be recorded as an income tax benefit and  for some portion related to deductions for stock option exercises  an increase in shareholders equity 
we had approximately  of net operating loss carryforwards and  of research and development tax credit carryforwards as of december  available to offset future net taxable income 
net loss as a result of the above  for the years ended december  and  we reported a net loss of  and  respectively  an improvement of  
basic and diluted loss per share the basic and diluted loss per share was and for the years ended december  and  respectively  for the reasons previously noted 
all outstanding stock options were considered antidilutive and therefore excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share for the years ended december  and because of the net loss reported for each period 
liquidity and capital resources overall on may   we borrowed million under an unsecured credit facility with a private  third party lender 
on november   we borrowed an additional million under an unsecured credit facility with the same private  third party lender 
the loans are represented by two promissory notes the notes that bear interest at the rate of per annum and are payable interest only on a monthly basis 
the notes are due and payable in full on may  and may be prepaid without penalty at any time 
the notes are subordinated to all existing and future senior indebtedness  as such term is defined in the notes 
warrants to purchase  shares of common stock for per share were granted in conjunction with the issuance of these notes 
such warrants are exercisable immediately and expire on november  the company used the proceeds from the million note to pay the outstanding borrowings under its line of credit with a bank 
such bank line of credit was retired as of december  the company used the proceeds of million note to provide working capital 
the existing notes are unsecured and do not prevent us from obtaining new senior secured financings 
we may seek additional credit facilities to complement the notes and provide us with funding should the need arise to finance growth or other expenditures 
it will be difficult to obtain a new line of credit facility given our recent operating losses and the current banking environment 
any new credit facility  if obtained  may not be on terms favorable to us 
we had over  of available cash and equivalents and net working capital of approximately  as of december  net working capital as of december  includes approximately million of accounts receivable and million of inventory 
we reduced both accounts receivable and inventory by approximately million during the year ended december  to generate cash  which  along with the proceeds of the notes  has provided adequate funding to support our operations 
management believes that it can continue to reduce inventory levels into to provide funding for operations  however no assurances can be given in that regard 
we do not consider raising capital through an equity offering to be a viable alternative to supplement working capital needs  given our current public equity valuation 
however  we may find it necessary to raise additional capital if we do not regain profitability during  are unable to improve liquidity through a reduction in our inventory and accounts receivable levels in the near term and do not have other means to support our planned operating activities 
our ability to obtain such capital  if required  would have a material adverse impact on our business  operations and financial condition  including our ability to continue operating as a going concern 
further such capital  if available  most likely would not be on terms favorable to us and our shareholders 
cash and cash equivalents balances as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents with an aggregate balance of  an increase from a balance of  at december  summarized immediately below and discussed in more detail in the subsequent subsections are the main elements of the  net increase in cash during the year ended december  operating activities  of net cash provided by operating activities through collections of accounts receivables and decreases in inventory levels  offset by our net losses and the payment of accounts payable 
non cash charges to income  such as the depreciation and amortization  increase in inventory obsolescence reserves  loss on debt extinguishment and stock based compensation were positive adjustments to reconcile net cash provided by operating activities 
investing activities  of net cash used in investing activities  primarily to acquire test and quality control equipment to supply our contract manufacturers  the acquisition of demonstration products for our salesman and the costs to acquire patents on our proprietary technology utilized in our new products 
financing activities  of net cash provided by financing activities related to the issuance of the million subordinated notes payable during offset by the repayment of the million bank line of credit and the payment of debt issuance costs 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was  for the year ended december  compared to net cash used in operating activities of  for the year ended december   an improvement of  the improvement in cash flow from operations for was primarily the result of collections of accounts receivable  the deferred tax provision and substantial decreases in inventory offset by our net losses and the payment of accounts payable 
during the year ended december   management focused on improving liquidity by reducing inventory levels and the collection of accounts receivable to fund payments to vendors and build cash reserves 
our goal is to increase revenues  return to profitability and decrease our inventory levels during  thereby providing positive cash flows from operations  although there can be no assurances that we will be successful in this regard 
investing activities cash used in investing activities was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in both and  we purchased production and research and development equipment to support our activities 
in the purchases were focused on acquiring test and quality control equipment to be used by our contract manufacturers and the acquisition of demonstration products for our salesman 
during and  we also incurred costs for patent applications on our proprietary technology utilized in our new products and included in intangible assets 
financing activities cash provided by investing activities was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during the year ended december   we issued subordinated notes in the aggregate principal amount of million  the proceeds of which were used to repay the  outstanding balance on our bank line of credit and to provide working capital 
we paid  of debt issuance costs related to the notes issued during there were no purchases of stock held in treasury  stock option exercises or similar transactions during the year ended december   which is attributable to the depressed value of our common stock 
net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december  was  which is attributable to borrowings under the company s line of credit and proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and their related tax benefits 
the net result of these activities was an increase in cash of  to  for the year ended december  commitments we had  of cash and cash equivalent balances and net positive working capital approximating million as of december  accounts receivable balances represented  of our net working capital at december  we intend to collect our outstanding receivables on a timely basis and reduce the overall level substantially during  which would help to provide positive cash flow to support our operations during inventory represented  of our net working capital at december  and finished goods represented  of total inventory 
we expect that finished goods will be converted to cash quickly when customer orders are received and shipments occur during we are actively managing the overall level of inventory and believe that such levels will be further reduced during by our sales activities  which should provide additional cash flow to help support our operations during capital expenditures 
we had no material commitments for capital expenditures at december  lease commitments 
we have several non cancelable long term operating lease agreements for office space and warehouse space 
the agreements expire at various dates through december we have also entered into month to month leases for equipment and facilities 
rent expense for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively  related to these leases 
the future minimum amounts due under the leases are as follows year ending december and thereafter license agreements 
we have several license agreements whereby we have been assigned the rights to certain licensed materials used in its products 
certain of these agreements require us to pay ongoing royalties based on the number of products shipped containing the licensed material on a quarterly basis 
royalty expense related to these agreements aggregated  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
following is a summary of our licenses as of december  license type effective date expiration date terms production software license agreement april  april  automatically renews for one year periods unless terminated by either party 
software sublicense agreement october  october  automatically renews for one year periods unless terminated by either party 
technology license agreement july  july  automatically renews for one year periods unless terminated by either party 
development  license and manufacturing agreement july  july  company has option to renew for three successive options to renew for three years periods unless terminated by either party 
limited license agreement august  perpetual may be terminated by either party 
during april  we terminated two license agreements because of failure of the counterparty to deliver the required materials and refusal to honor warranty provisions 
in addition  one of the agreements was never approved by the company 
both of these terminations are in dispute and we have filed a lawsuit to enforce our rights and protect our interests pursuant to these agreements 
see litigation below 
supply and distribution agreement 
we entered into a supply and distribution agreement on may  under which we were granted the exclusive worldwide right to sell and distribute a proprietary law enforcement speed measurement device and derivatives to its customers 
the term of the agreement was months after the date the supplier began full scale production of the product which commenced in august and final certification of the product was obtained 
the agreement had minimum purchase requirements of  units per period over three commitment periods 
on january   the parties amended the supply and distribution agreement to reduce the minimum purchase commitments over the second and third years by from the original commitment 
we also agreed to terminate our world wide right to exclusively market the products to the law enforcement community in exchange for the reduction in the purchase commitment 
after the initial term has expired  the parties may continue on a month to month basis and is terminable by either party upon thirty days advance notice 
the contract may be terminated earlier in case of material breach by either party that is not cured within thirty days of notice of the breach 
the agreement contains required minimum order quantities and fixed prices per unit according to the following schedule minimum order commitment amount commitment time period commitment purchases remaining commitment august through february march through february march through february the above table reflects the modified terms of the amended supply and distribution agreement 
the supplier is responsible for all warranty  damage or other claims  losses or liabilities related to the product and is obligated to defend and indemnify us against such risks 
we hold approximately  of such products in finished goods inventory as of december  litigation 
we are subject to various legal proceedings arising from normal business operations 
although there can be no assurances  based on the information currently available  management believes that it is probable that the ultimate outcome of each of the actions will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
however  an adverse outcome in certain of the actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial results in the period in which it is recorded 
on june   we filed suit against z technologies  llc z in federal court for the district of kansas claiming breach of a production software license agreement entered into during october and the rescission of a second limited license agreement entered into during january among various other claims  we asserted that z failed to deliver the material required under the contracts  the product that was delivered by z is defective and or unusable and that the january contract should be rescinded and declared void  unenforceable and of no force or effect 
we paid license fees and made other payments to z totaling  to date under these contracts 
z has denied our claims and has filed counterclaims that allege we did not have the right to terminate the contracts and therefore that it has been damaged for loss of profits and related damages 
our insurance carrier has settled a portion of the counterclaims under our director and officer liability insurance policy 
the counterclaims that remain after the settlement by the insurance carrier are still in controversy 
discovery and depositions by both parties have been concluded and both parties have filed summary judgment motions at this time 
these summary judgment motions have not yet been ruled upon and no trial date has been set 
on october   the circuit court of jackson county  missouri awarded us an interlocutory judgment against a former contract manufacturer 
we had filed for and received a temporary restraining order in june that forbids the supplier from engaging in certain actions involving us 
the interlocutory judgment was entered against the supplier that in effect cancelled all purchase orders and confirmed that we had no further obligations  whether monetary or otherwise  to the supplier 
we have received a notice of the filing of bankruptcy under chapter effective october  by this supplier 
on may   the court granted a default judgment awarding us damages and legal fees totaling  we intend to pursue collection from the bankruptcy estate and applicable insurance policies 
management believes that the ultimate collection of any award of damages over and above the  in unpaid invoices is uncertain at this time because of the current financial status of the supplier in the pending bankruptcy proceedings and the uncertainty of insurance coverage 
we have filed a garnishment claim against all insurance proceeds from policies issued and in force covering the contract manufacturer when these actions occurred 
we are also involved as a plaintiff and defendant in ordinary  routine litigation and administrative proceedings incidental to its business from time to time  including customer collections  vendor and employment related matters 
we believe the likely outcome of any other pending cases and proceedings will not be material to our business or financial condition 
k plan 
we sponsor a k retirement savings plan for the benefit of our employees 
the plan  as amended  requires us to provide matching contributions for employees who elect to contribute up to of their compensation to the plan and matching contributions for employee s elective deferrals on the next of their contributions 
we made matching contributions totaling  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
each participant is vested at all times in employee and employer matching contributions 
stock repurchase program 
during june  our board of directors approved a program that authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock in the open market  or in privately negotiated transactions  through july  our board of directors approved an extension of this program to july  we made no purchases under this program during the years ended december  and the company has repurchased  shares at a total cost of  average cost of per share under this program from inception to december  standby letters of credit 
we are contingently liable as of december  for standby letters of credit issued by a bank for an aggregate amount of  to certain customers as security if we do not honor our contractual warranty obligations on the products delivered to such customers 
the outstanding standby letters expire in may and we have never had a beneficiary demand funding related to such standby letters of credit 
non compliance with nasdaq listing requirements 
on september  we received a notice from the nasdaq stock market stating that the closing bid price of our common stock for the prior consecutive business days had been below per share and therefore we were not in compliance with marketplace rule a 
we had calendar days  or until march   to regain compliance with the minimum bid requirement under the first notice  but were unable to do so 
on march   the nasdaq stock market advised us that it had determined that we are eligible for an additional day calendar period to regain compliance with the minimum bid requirement for continued listing on it 
accordingly  to regain compliance  the closing bid price of our common stock must be at least per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days prior to september  in accordance with marketplace rule c a 
if we fail to achieve compliance within such period our common stock could be de listed and we would most likely be traded on the otc bulletin board 
such event could have an adverse impact on the liquidity of our trading market and price of our common stock  among other items 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item  financial statements  of this report 
while the selection and application of any accounting policy may involve some level of subjective judgments and estimates  we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to our financial statements  potentially involve the most subjective judgments in their selection and application  and are the most susceptible to uncertainties and changing conditions revenue recognition allowance for doubtful accounts  allowance for excess and obsolete inventory  warranty reserves  stock based compensation expense  and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition allowances for doubtful accounts 
revenue is recognized for the shipment of products or delivery of service when all four of the following conditions are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the price is fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
we review all significant  unusual or nonstandard shipments of product or delivery of services as a routine part of our accounting and financial reporting process to determine compliance with these requirements 
our principal customers are state  local and federal law enforcement agencies  which historically have been low risks for uncollectible accounts 
however  we do have commercial customers and international distributors that present a greater risk for uncollectible accounts than such law enforcement customers and we consider a specific reserve for bad debts based on their individual circumstances 
our historical bad debts have been negligible with less than  charged off as uncollectible on cumulative revenues of million since we commenced deliveries during as of december  and december   we recorded a reserve for doubtful accounts of  and  respectively 
we periodically perform a specific review of significant individual receivables outstanding for risk of loss due to uncollectibility 
based on our specific review  we consider our reserve for doubtful accounts to be adequate as of december  however  should the balance due from any significant customer ultimately become uncollectible then our allowance for bad debts will not be sufficient to cover the charge off and we will be required to record additional bad debt expense in our statement of operations 
allowance for excess and obsolete inventory 
we record valuation reserves on our inventory for estimated excess or obsolete inventory items 
the amount of the reserve is equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
on a quarterly basis  management performs an analysis of the underlying inventory to identify reserves needed for excess and obsolescence 
management uses its best judgment to estimate appropriate reserves based on this analysis 
in addition  we adjust the carrying value of inventory if the current market value of that inventory is below its cost 
inventories consisted of the following at december  and december  december  december  raw material and component parts work in process finished goods subtotal reserve for excess and obsolete inventory total we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive delivery performance to our customers against the risk of inventory obsolescence due to changing technology and customer requirements 
as reflected above  our inventory reserves represented of the gross inventory balance at december   compared to of the gross inventory balance at december  our finished goods are composed primarily of our new dvm system  the dvm plus  the firstvu  the laser ally  the thermal ally  the dvm event recorder and the dvf flashlight products  none of which is considered excess or obsolete 
we have reduced the finished goods inventory related to the legacy dvm system to zero as of december  and therefore it does not represent an obsolescence risk 
raw material and component part inventory balances were substantially decreased at december  compared to december   as we focused on reducing our overall inventory levels 
in  we also focused on outsourcing more component part production and increasing our efforts to carry efficient levels of raw materials and component parts commensurate with current sales forecasts 
we plan to continue our efforts to reduce overall inventory levels during we have inventory reserves for pending changes to the product line  engineering upgrades and design changes that alter the demand for component parts and a shift of production to outsourcing 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management or significant engineering changes to our products that are not anticipated and appropriately managed  additional inventory write downs may be required in excess of the inventory reserves already established 
warranty reserves 
we generally provide a two year parts and labor warranty on our products to our customers 
provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranties are made at the time products are sold 
these estimates are established using historical information on the nature  frequency  and average cost of claims 
we actively study trends of claims and take action to improve product quality and minimize claims 
our warranty reserves were decreased to  as of december  compared to  as of december   which reflects the decreased number of units under warranty and the resolution of the wireless transfer module failures experienced in early our new dvm product failure rate has improved significantly during and  which has contributed to the relatively stable level of warranty reserves 
we have recently introduced several new products  including the firstvu  laser ally  dvm  dvm  dvm and thermal ally  for which we have limited exposure since the third party manufacturers of these products are responsible for all warranty claims 
there is a risk that we will have higher warranty claim frequency rates and average cost of claims than our history has indicated on our legacy mirror products 
actual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods 
stock based compensation expense 
we grant stock options to our employees and directors and such benefits provided are share based payment awards which require us to make significant estimates related to determining the value of our share based compensation 
our expected stock price volatility assumption is based on historical volatilities of the underlying stock which are obtained from public data sources 
we granted  options during the year ended december  the assumptions used for the determining the grant date fair value of options granted during the year ended december  are reflected in the following table year ended december  expected term of the options in years years expected volatility of company stock expected dividends none risk free interest rate expected forfeiture rate if factors change and we develop different assumptions in future periods  the compensation expense that we record in the future may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
there is a high degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to estimate share based compensation 
changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect our estimates of fair values of our share based compensation 
certain share based payment awards  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  values may be realized from these instruments that are significantly in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
although the fair value of employee share based awards is determined using an established option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 
in addition  we are required to net estimated forfeitures against compensation expense 
this requires us to estimate the number of awards that will be forfeited prior to vesting 
if actual forfeitures in future periods are different than our initial estimate  the compensation expense that we ultimately record may differ significantly from what was originally estimated 
the estimated forfeiture rate for unvested options outstanding as of december  range from to accounting for income taxes 
accounting for income taxes requires significant estimates and judgments on the part of management 
such estimates and judgments include  but are not limited to  the effective tax rate anticipated to apply to tax differences that are expected to reverse in the future  the sufficiency of taxable income in future periods to realize the benefits of net deferred tax assets and net operating losses currently recorded and the likelihood that tax positions taken in tax returns will be sustained on audit 
as required by authoritative guidance  we record deferred tax assets or liabilities based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently enacted rates that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
authoritative guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
as of december   cumulative valuation allowances in the amount of  were recorded in connection with the net deferred income tax assets 
based on a review of our deferred tax assets and recent operating performance  we determined that our valuation allowance should be increased to  to fully reserve our deferred tax assets at december  we determined that it was appropriate to continue to provide a full valuation reserve on our net deferred tax assets as of december  because of the losses we incurred during the year ended december  we expect to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance until we determine that we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to realize these assets 
to the extent we determine that the realization of some or all of these benefits is more likely than not based upon expected future taxable income  a portion or all of the valuation allowance will be reversed 
such a reversal would be recorded as an income tax benefit and  for some portion related to deductions for stock option exercises  an increase in shareholders equity 
as required by authoritative guidance  we have performed a comprehensive review of our portfolio of uncertain tax positions in accordance with recognition standards established by the fasb  an uncertain tax position represents our expected treatment of a tax position taken in a filed tax return  or planned to be taken in a future tax return  that has not been reflected in measuring income tax expense for financial reporting purposes 
we have no recorded liability as of december  representing uncertain tax positions 
we have generated substantial deferred income tax assets related to our operations primarily from the charge to compensation expense taken for stock options  certain tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards 
for us to realize the income tax benefit of these assets  we must generate sufficient taxable income in future periods when such deductions are allowed for income tax purposes 
in some cases where deferred taxes were the result of compensation expense recognized on stock options  our ability to realize the income tax benefit of these assets is also dependent on our share price increasing to a point where these options have intrinsic value at least equal to the grant date fair value and are exercised 
in assessing whether a valuation allowance is needed in connection with our deferred income tax assets  we have evaluated our ability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to utilize the benefit of the deferred income tax assets 
we continue to evaluate our ability to use recorded deferred income tax asset balances 
if we fail to generate taxable income for financial reporting in future years  no additional tax benefit would be recognized for those losses  since we will not have accumulated enough positive evidence to support our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards in the future 
therefore we may be required to increase our valuation allowance in future periods should our assumptions regarding the generation of future taxable income not be realized 
inflation and seasonality inflation has not materially affected us during the past fiscal year 
we do not believe that our business is seasonal in nature however  generally we generate higher revenues during the second half of the calendar year than in the first half
