item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company is a financial holding company that offers a broad array of financial service products to its target market of professionals  small and medium sized businesses  and high net worth individuals 
our operating segments include commercial banking  investment banking  wealth management  and insurance 
earnings are derived primarily from our net interest income  which is interest income less interest expense  and our noninterest income earned from fee based business lines and banking service fees  offset by noninterest expense 
as the majority of our assets are interest earning and our liabilities are interest bearing  changes in interest rates impact our net interest margin  the largest component of our operating revenue which is defined as net interest income plus noninterest income 
we manage our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on our operating results 
we also have focused on reducing our dependency on our net interest margin by increasing our noninterest income 
during the economic and industry turmoil since  we have continued to focus on developing an organization with personnel  management systems and products that will allow us to compete effectively and position us for growth 
many of our competitors have drastically cut costs by closing locations and reducing employee bases during this time 
although we have also focused on reducing costs that do not impact customer service  we have also continued to invest in systems and business production personnel to strengthen our future growth prospects 
the economic downturn has also negatively impacted our customer base and our levels of nonperforming assets have increased as a result 
the combination of the increased levels of nonperforming assets and continued investment in the business has caused relatively high levels of noninterest expense that has adversely affected our earnings over the past several years 
salaries and employee benefits  loan workout costs and losses on other real estate owned oreo have comprised most of this overhead category

this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this form k beginning on page f for a discussion of the segments included in our principal activities and for certain financial information for each segment  see segment results discussed below and note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
in making those critical accounting estimates  we are required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate 
different estimates we could reasonably have used  or changes in the assumptions that could occur  could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of operations 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy that requires subjective estimates in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management s periodic review of the collectability of loans in light of historical experience  the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
in determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses  we analyze the various components of the loan portfolio  including all significant credits  on an individual basis 
when analyzing the adequacy  we segment the loan portfolio into components with similar characteristics  such as risk classification  past due status  type of loan  industry or collateral 
we have a systematic process to evaluate individual loans and pools of loans within our loan portfolio 
we maintain a loan grading system whereby each loan is assigned a grade between and  with representing the highest quality credit  representing a loan where collection or liquidation in full is highly questionable and improbable  and representing a loss that has been or will be charged off 
loans that are graded or lower are categorized as non classified credits  while loans graded and higher are categorized as classified credits that have a higher risk of loss 
grades are assigned based upon the degree of risk associated with repayment of a loan in the normal course of business pursuant to the original terms 
differences between the actual credit outcome of a loan and the risk assessment made by the company could negatively impact the company s earnings by requiring additional provision for loan losses 
as a hypothetical example  if million of grade  non classified loans were transferred into classified loans at the same percentage level of existing classified loans  an additional million of provision for loan losses would be required 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on management s methodology 
other real estate owned other real estate owned oreo represents properties acquired through foreclosure or physical possession 
write downs to fair value at the time of transfer to oreo are charged to the allowance for loan losses 
subsequent to foreclosure  we periodically evaluate the value of oreo held for sale and record a valuation allowance for any subsequent declines in fair value less selling costs 
subsequent declines in value are charged to operations 
fair value is based on our assessment of information available to us at the end of a reporting period and depends upon a number of factors  including our historical experience  economic conditions  and issues specific to individual properties 
our evaluation of these factors involves subjective estimates and judgments that may change 

table of contents deferred taxes the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
if current available information raises doubt as to the realization of the deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance may be established 
we consider the determination of this valuation allowance to be a critical accounting policy because of the need to exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets  including projections of future taxable income 
these judgments and estimates are reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change 
at december   the company reversed the valuation allowance of million it established during the fourth quarter of see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets may be required in the future if the amounts of taxes recoverable through loss carry backs decline  if we project lower levels of future taxable income  or we project lower levels of tax planning strategies 
such additional valuation allowance would be established through a charge to income tax expense that would adversely affect our operating results 
share based payments under asc topic  compensation stock compensation asc  we use the black scholes option valuation model to determine the fair value of our stock options as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the black scholes fair value model includes various assumptions  including the expected volatility  expected life and expected dividend rate of the options 
in addition  the company is required to estimate the amount of options issued that are expected to be forfeited 
these assumptions reflect our best estimates  but they involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of our control 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used  share based compensation expense  as calculated and recorded under asc  could have been materially impacted 
furthermore  if we use different assumptions in future periods  share based compensation expense could be materially impacted in future periods 
asc requires that cash retained as a result of the tax deductibility of employee share based awards be presented as a component of cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
fair value the company has adopted asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures asc  as it applies to financial assets and liabilities effective january  asc defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is defined under asc as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
as a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements  asc establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs that are classified within levels and of the hierarchy and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions unobservable inputs classified within level of the hierarchy 
fair value may be used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities such as available for sale securities and derivatives in which fair value is the primary basis of accounting 
similarly  fair value may be used on a nonrecurring basis to evaluate certain assets or liabilities such as impaired loans 
depending on the nature of the asset or liability  the company uses various valuation techniques and assumptions in accordance with asc to determine the instrument s fair value 
at december   million 
table of contents of total assets  consisting of million in available for sale securities and million in derivative instruments  represented assets recorded at fair value on a recurring basis 
at december   million of total assets  consisting of million in available for sale securities and million in derivative instruments  represented assets recorded at fair value on a recurring basis 
certain private label mbs valued using broker dealer quotes based on proprietary broker models  which are considered by the company an unobservable input level  totaled million and million of total assets at december  and  respectively 
the company recognized million and million in other than temporary impairments on the private label mbs for the year ended december  and  respectively 
at december  and  million and million  respectively  of total liabilities represented derivative instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis 
assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis consisted of impaired loans totaling million and million at december  and  respectively 
for additional information on the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we also have other policies that we consider to be significant accounting policies  however  these policies  which are disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  do not meet the definition of critical accounting policies because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective

our primary lending focus is commercial and real estate lending to small and medium sized businesses with annual sales of million to million  and businesses and individuals with borrowing requirements of  to million 
at december   substantially all of our outstanding loans were to customers within colorado and arizona 
interest rates charged on loans vary with the degree of risk  maturity  underwriting and servicing costs  principal amount  and extent of other banking relationships with the customer 
interest rates are further subject to competitive pressures  money market rates  availability of funds  and government regulations 
see net interest income for an analysis of the interest rates on our loans 
credit procedures and review 
we address credit risk through internal credit policies and procedures  including underwriting criteria  officer and customer lending limits  a multi layered loan approval process for larger loans  periodic document examination  justification for any exceptions to credit policies  loan review and concentration monitoring 
in response to current conditions and heightened default risk due to depressed real estate and collateral values  the company expanded the resources of the credit and loan review departments to provide for a more proactive identification and management of problem credits 
in addition  we provide ongoing loan officer training and review 
we have a continuous loan review process designed to promote early identification of credit quality problems  assisted by a dedicated senior credit officer in each geographic market 
all loan officers are charged with the responsibility of reviewing  at least on a monthly basis  all past due loans in their respective portfolios 
in addition  each of the loan officers establishes a watch list of loans to be reviewed by the board of directors of the bank 
the loan portfolio is also monitored regularly by a loan review department that reports to the chief operations officer of the company and submits reports directly to the audit committee of the board of directors and the credit administration department 
in order to effectively respond to the current credit cycle  declining asset quality and increasing foreclosures  the company made a significant investment in to establish a special assets group 
table of contents comprised of experienced professionals to efficiently manage nonperforming assets 
management believes having the specialized function will allow our bankers to focus on seeking new lending and deposit relationships while troubled asset levels are effectively managed 
in the latter part of  the company began redeploying certain officers from the special assets group into production roles due to the improvement in asset quality 
composition of loan portfolio 
the following table sets forth the composition of our loan portfolio at the dates indicated 
at december  in thousands amount amount amount amount amount commercial real estate mortgage land acquisition development real estate construction consumer other total loans less allowance for loan losses net loans held for investment loans held for sale net loans gross loans decreased million in loan portfolio composition at december  did not change materially from the prior year 
the company experienced growth in its jumbo mortgage product leading to an increase in consumer loans of million or to million at december  other loans also increased million or to million at december  due to growth in tax exempt financing 
increases in these two loan categories were offset by decreases in the land acquisition and development million and real estate construction million categories 
the loan portfolio s downward trend in prior years is primarily attributable to a decrease in the land acquisition and development loan portfolio 
due to overall market illiquidity and the significant value declines on raw land during that time  the company ceased lending activities for the acquisition and future development of land 
the land acquisition and development loan portfolio contributed to of the total decrease of million in our loan portfolio since the recent adverse economic conditions have contributed to a challenging operating environment and a downward trend in loan demand 
however  the shift in loan concentration is primarily attributed to successful efforts to further diversify the company s loan portfolio 
the company has been successful in reducing high risk loan concentration levels and growing other loan categories mainly by exploring new niche lending opportunities such as tax exempt financing and jumbo mortgages 
under state law  the aggregate amount of loans we can make to one borrower is generally limited to of our unimpaired capital  surplus  undivided profits and allowance for loan losses 
at december   our individual legal lending limit was million 
the bank s board of directors has established an internal lending limit of million for normal credit extensions and million for the highest rated credit types 
to accommodate customers whose financing needs exceed our internal lending limits and to address portfolio concentration concerns  we sell loan participations to outside participants 
at december  and  the outstanding balance of loan participations sold by us was million and million  respectively 
at december  and  we had loan participations purchased from other banks totaling million and million  respectively 
we use the same analysis in deciding whether or not to purchase a participation in a loan as we would in deciding whether to originate the same loan 
due to the nature of our business as a commercial banking institution  our lending relationships are typically larger than those of a retail bank 
the following table describes the number of relationships and the percentage of the dollar value of the loan portfolio by the size of the credit relationship 

table of contents number of of number of of number of of credit relationships relationships loan portfolio relationships loan portfolio relationships loan portfolio greater than million million to million million to million million to million less than million the majority of the loan relationships exceeding million are in our real estate and commercial portfolios 
at december    and  there were no concentrations of loans related to any single industry in excess of of total loans 
the company may be subject to additional regulatory supervisory oversight if its concentration in commercial real estate lending exceeds regulatory parameters 
pursuant to interagency guidance issued by the federal reserve and other federal banking agencies  supervisory criteria were put in place to define commercial real estate concentrations as construction  land development and other land loans that represent or more of total risk based capital  or commercial real estate loans as defined in the guidance that represent or more of total risk based capital and the real estate portfolio has increased more than or more during the prior months 
at december  and  the company s exposure to commercial real estate lending was below the parameters discussed above 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into various types of transactions that include commitments to extend credit 
we apply the same credit standards to these commitments as we apply to our other lending activities and have included these commitments in our lending risk evaluations 
our exposure to credit loss under commitments to extend credit is represented by the amount of these commitments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on our commitments 
commercial loans

land acquisition and development loans may be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy

table of contents at december  in thousands nonperforming loans loans days or more past due and still accruing interest nonaccrual loans commercial real estate mortgage land acquisition development real estate construction consumer and other total nonaccrual loans total nonperforming loans oreo and repossessed assets total nonperforming assets allowance for loan losses allowance for credit losses allowance for loan and credit losses nonperforming assets to total assets nonperforming loans to total loans nonperforming loans and oreo to total loans and oreo allowance for loan and credit losses to total loans excluding loans held for sale allowance for loan and credit losses to nonperforming loans accrual of interest is discontinued on a loan when management believes  after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts  the borrower s financial condition is such that the collection of interest is doubtful 
a delinquent loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status when it becomes days past due 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  all accrued and unpaid interest on the loan is reversed and deducted from earnings as a reduction of reported interest income 
no additional interest is accrued on the loan balance until the collection of both principal and interest becomes reasonably certain 
when the issues relating to a nonaccrual loan are finally resolved  there may ultimately be an actual write down or charge off of the principal balance of the loan  which may necessitate additional charges to earnings 
restructured loans are those for which concessions  including the reduction of interest rates below a rate otherwise available to the borrower  or the reduction of interest or principal  have been granted due to the borrower s weakened financial condition 
interest on restructured loans is accrued at the restructured rates when it is anticipated that no loss of original principal will occur 
interest income that would have been recorded had nonaccrual loans performed in accordance with their original contract terms during  and  was million  million and million  respectively 
oreo represents real property taken by the bank either through foreclosure or through a deed in lieu thereof from the borrower 
repossessed assets include vehicles and other commercial assets acquired under agreements with delinquent borrowers 
subsequent to acquisition at fair value  repossessed assets and oreo are carried at the lesser of cost or fair market value  less selling costs

in addition to the nonperforming assets described above  the company had customer relationships considered by management to be potential problem loans with outstanding principal of approximately million 
a potential problem loan is one as to which management has concerns about the borrower s future performance under the terms of the loan contract 
for our protection  management monitors these loans closely 
these loans are current as to the principal and interest and  accordingly  are not included in the nonperforming asset categories 
however  further deterioration may result in the loan being classified as nonperforming 
the level of potential problem loans is factored into the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 

table of contents analysis of allowance for loan and credit losses 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s recognition of the risks of extending credit and its evaluation of the quality of the loan portfolio 
the allowance is maintained to provide for probable credit losses related to specifically identified loans and for losses inherent in the loan portfolio that have been incurred at the balance sheet date 
the allowance is based on various factors affecting the loan portfolio  including a review of problem loans  business conditions  historical loss experience  evaluation of the quality of the underlying collateral  and holding and disposal costs 
the allowance is increased by additional charges to operating income and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the allowance for credit losses represents management s recognition of a separate reserve for off balance sheet loan commitments and letters of credit 
while the allowance for loan losses is recorded as a contra asset to the loan portfolio on the consolidated balance sheets  the allowance for credit losses is recorded in accrued interest and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
although the allowances are presented separately on the consolidated balance sheets  any losses incurred from credit losses would be reported as a charge off in the allowance for loan losses  since any loss would be recorded after the off balance sheet commitment had been funded 
due to the relationship of these allowances  as extensions of credit underwritten through a comprehensive risk analysis  information on both the allowance for loan and credit losses positions is presented in the following table 
for the year ended december  in thousands balance of allowance for loan losses at beginning of period charge offs commercial real estate mortgage land acquisition development real estate construction consumer other total charge offs recoveries commercial real estate mortgage land acquisition development real estate construction consumer other total recoveries net charge offs provision for loan losses charged to operations balance of allowance for loan losses at end of period balance of allowance for credit losses at beginning of period provision for credit losses charged to operations balance of allowance for credit losses at end of period total provision for loan and credit losses charged to operations ratio of net charge offs to average loans average loans outstanding during the period additions to the allowances for loan and credit losses  which are charged as expenses on our consolidated statements of operations  are made periodically to maintain the allowances at the appropriate level  based on our analysis of the potential risk in the loan and commitment portfolios 
loans charged off  net of amounts recovered from previously charged off loans  reduce the allowance for loan losses 
the amount of the allowance is a function of the levels of loans outstanding  the level of nonperforming loans  historical loan loss experience  amount of loan losses charged against the reserve during a given period and current economic conditions 
federal regulatory agencies  as part of their examination process  review our loans and allowance for loan and credit losses 
we believe that our allowance for loan and credit losses is adequate to cover anticipated loan and credit losses 
however  management may determine a need to increase the allowances for loan and credit losses  or regulators  when reviewing the bank s loan and commitment portfolio in the future  may request the bank increase such allowances 
either of these events could adversely affect our earnings 
further  there can be no assurance that actual loan and credit losses will not exceed the allowances for loan and credit losses 

table of contents the allowance for loan losses consists of three elements i specific reserves determined in accordance with asc topic receivables based on probable losses on specific loans  ii general reserves determined in accordance with guidance in asc topic contingencies  based on historical loan loss experience adjusted for other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to the company  and iii unallocated reserves 
the methodology used in the periodic review of reserve adequacy  which is performed at least quarterly  is designed to be dynamic and responsive to changes in actual and expected credit losses 
these changes are reflected in both the general and unallocated reserves 
the historical loss ratios and estimated risk factors related to segmenting our loan portfolio  which are key considerations in this analysis  are updated quarterly and are weighted more heavily for recent economic conditions 
the review of reserve adequacy is performed by executive management and presented to the audit committee quarterly for its review and consideration 
for additional information on the company s methodology for estimated the allowance for loan and credit losses  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the table below provides an allocation of the allowance for loan and credit losses by loan and commitment type  however  allocation of a portion of the allowance to one category of loans does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other categories at december  loans in loans in loans in loans in loans in category as a category as a category as a category as a category as a amount of of total amount of of total amount of of total amount of of total amount of of total in thousands allowance gross loans allowance gross loans allowance gross loans allowance gross loans allowance gross loans commercial real estate mortgage land acquisition development real estate construction consumer other unallocated off balance sheet commitments total we believe that any allocation of the allowance into categories creates an appearance of precision that does not exist 
the allocation table should not be interpreted as an indication of the specific amounts  by loan classification  to be charged to the allowance 
we believe that the table is a useful device for assessing the adequacy of the allowance as a whole 
the allowance is utilized as a single unallocated allowance available for all loans 
the provision for loan and credit losses of the company decreased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  in and  net charge offs exceeded provision for loan and credit losses by million and million  respectively 
the decreasing provision levels during and are primarily the result of improved asset quality 
the company s allowance for loan and credit losses to total loans was and at december  and  respectively 
the allowance for loan and credit losses to nonperforming loans increased from at december   to at december  we believe that our allowance for loan and credit losses is adequate to cover anticipated loan and credit losses 
however  due to changes in the factors considered by management in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan and credit losses  it is possible management may determine a need to increase the allowance for loan and credit losses 
such determination could have an adverse effect in the level of future loan and credit loss provisions and the company s earnings 
investments the investment portfolio is primarily comprised of mbs explicitly gnma and implicitly fnma and fhlmc backed by the us government  with the majority of the portfolio either maturing or repricing within one to five years 
the portfolio does not include any securities exposed to sub prime mortgage 
table of contents loans 
the investment portfolio also includes single issuer trust preferred securities and corporate debt securities 
the corporate debt securities portfolio is mainly comprised of six issuers in the fortune over eighty five percent of the corporate debt securities portfolio is investment grade with a rating of a or better 
none of the issuing institutions are in default nor have interest payments on the trust preferred securities been deferred 
our investment strategies are reviewed in bi monthly meetings of the asset liability management committee 
our mortgage backed securities are typically classified as available for sale 
our goals with respect to the securities portfolio are to maximize safety and soundness  provide adequate liquidity  maximize rate of return within the constraints of applicable liquidity requirements  and complement asset liability management strategies

the fair value of these securities is expected to recover as the securities approach their stated maturity or repricing date

the company may recognize additional losses on these securities if the underlying credit metrics were to worsen in the future 
during  other investments increased million primarily due to million of fhlb stock purchases  offset by million fhlb stock sale 
the company s investment in fhlb stock is primarily related to maintaining a borrowing base with the fhlb 
fhlb stock holdings are largely dependent upon the company s liquidity position 
to the extent the need for wholesale funding increases or decreases  the company may purchase additional or sell excess fhlb stock  respectively

at december   the value of oreo properties was evenly distributed between arizona and colorado 
other assets 
other assets decreased million during the year ended december   primarily due to the release of restricted cash collateral held at correspondent banks relating to letters of credit issued on behalf of our customers million  amortization of prepaid fdic insurance million and distributions from private equity investments million 
declines were offset in part by increases in the fair value of customer interest rate swaps million  advisory fee receivables million and income tax receivables million 
other assets decreased million during the year ended december   due primarily to amortization of prepaid fdic insurance and receipt of income tax refunds offset by increases in restricted cash collateral placed with other banks on behalf of our customers 
deposits our primary source of funds has historically been customer deposits 
we offer a variety of accounts for depositors  which are designed to attract both short and long term deposits 
these accounts include certificates of deposit cds  money market accounts  savings accounts  checking and now accounts  and individual retirement accounts 
average noninterest bearing deposits increased million to million during and total million at december  during  average noninterest bearing deposits increased million and were million at december  we believe we receive a large amount of noninterest bearing deposits because we provide customers the option of paying for treasury management services in cash or by maintaining additional noninterest bearing account balances 
the company s noninterest bearing deposits represented more than of total deposits at december   up significantly from at the end of the company began offering interest bearing demand deposits in and eliminated its eurodollar account product in in response to the dodd frank act repeal of the prohibition of paying interest on demand deposits 
interest bearing accounts earn interest at rates based on competitive market factors and our desire to increase or decrease certain types of maturities or deposits 
the company has not participated in the brokered deposit market in any meaningful way since before due to the strength of our core deposits 
brokered deposits are considered a wholesale financing source and can be used as an alternative to other short term borrowings 
the company views its reciprocal certificate of deposit account registry service cdars accounts as customer related deposits 
the cdars program is provided through a third party and designed to provide full fdic insurance on deposit amounts larger than the stated maximum by exchanging or reciprocating larger depository relationships with other member banks 
depositor funds are broken into smaller amounts and placed with other banks that are members of the network 
each member bank issues cds in amounts under  so the entire deposit is eligible for fdic insurance 
cdars are technically brokered deposits  however  the company considers the reciprocal deposits placed through the cdars program as core funding due to the customer relationship that generated the transaction and does not report the balances as brokered sources in its internal or external financial reports

net income for the year ended december  was million  an increase over net losses of million and million for and growth in net income for compared to was driven by lower provision for loan losses  lower noninterest expense and the reversal of a million deferred income tax asset valuation allowance 
the company continues to make improvements in overall asset quality  reflected in the loan loss provision of million compared to million and million in the prior two annual periods 
noninterest income growth of million was driven by our investment banking segment while noninterest expense reductions of million relate primarily to lower losses on securities  other assets and oreo and oreo and loan workout costs 
net loss for decreased million from the net loss and was driven by lower provision for loan losses and goodwill impairment charges and higher noninterest income 
noninterest income increased million in compared to and was largely attributed to the our investment banking segment

earnings per common share on a diluted basis for the year ended december   was compared to a losses per diluted common share of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net interest income 
the largest component of our net income is our net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income  principally from loans and investment securities  and interest expense  principally on customer deposits and borrowings 
changes in net interest income result from changes in volume  net interest spread and net interest margin 
volume refers to the average dollar levels of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin refers to net interest income divided by average interest earning assets and is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the majority of our assets are interest earning and our liabilities are interest bearing 
accordingly  changes in interest rates may impact our net interest margin 
the federal open markets committee fomc uses the federal funds rate  which is the interest rate used by banks to lend to each other  to influence interest rates and the national economy 
changes in the federal funds rate have a direct correlation to changes in the prime rate  the underlying index for most of the variable rate loans issued by 
table of contents the company 
in september  the fomc began lowering its target for the federal funds rate and continued lowering the target through december by which time it had reduced the target rate by basis points to a range of basis points  a target range still in effect at december  in its january meeting  the fomc indicated that current economic conditions would likely warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late as the company is asset sensitive  continued low rates will negatively impact the company s earnings and net interest margin

deposit service charges primarily consist of fees earned from our treasury management services 
customers are given the option to pay for these services in cash or by offsetting the fees for these services against an earnings credit that is given for maintaining noninterest bearing deposits 
fees earned from treasury management services will fluctuate based on the number of customers using the services and from changes in us treasury rates which are used as a benchmark for the earnings credit rate 
other miscellaneous deposit charges are transactional by nature and may not be consistent period over period 
as the earnings credit rate decreases  the amount of cash fees paid for service charges increases

net income for the corporate support and other segment increased million to million during the year ended december  the primary component of net interest income expense for the segment is interest expense related to the company s long term debt see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in the first quarter of  interest expense on a portion of variable rate debt was fixed through the use of interest rate swaps see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the decrease in net interest income is attributable to a decrease in interest income on the loan portfolio the parent purchased from the bank in the provision for loan losses relates to a portfolio of loans purchased by the parent from the bank 
this portfolio has steadily decreased since the purchase due to loan repayments and collateral sales

table of contents addition  the declining balance of the portfolio has contributed to the decrease in the provision for loan losses 
noninterest expense includes salaries and benefits of employees of the parent and support functions as well as the nonemployee overhead operating costs not directly associated with another segment 
noninterest expense decreased million to million in from million a year earlier  primarily as a result of a decrease in loan workout expenses and other legal and professional expenses incurred in conjunction with the loan portfolio owned by the parent 
the provision for income tax includes the benefit from a deferred income tax valuation reversal of million 
the million deferred income tax valuation was recorded in the fourth quarter of liquidity and capital resources liquidity refers to the company s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet financial obligations to its customers and shareholders in order to fund loans  to respond to deposit outflows and to cover operating expenses 
maintaining a level of liquid funds through asset liability management seeks to ensure that these needs are met at a reasonable cost 
liquidity is essential to compensate for fluctuations in the balance sheet and provide funds for growth and normal operating expenditures 
sources of funds include customer deposits  scheduled amortization of loans  loan prepayments  scheduled maturities of investments and cash flows from mortgage backed securities 
liquidity needs may also be met by deposit growth  converting assets into cash  raising funds in the brokered cd market or borrowing using lines of credit with correspondent banks  the fhlb or the frb 
longer term liquidity needs may be met by selling securities available for sale or raising additional capital 
liquidity management is the process by which the company manages the continuing flow of funds necessary to meet its financial commitments on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost 
the objective of liquidity management is to ensure the company has the ability to satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers and to allow us to sustain our operations 
these funding commitments include withdrawals by depositors  credit commitments to borrowers  shareholder dividends  debt payments  expenses of our operations and capital expenditures 
liquidity is monitored and closely managed by the company s asset and liability committee alco  a group of senior officers from the lending  deposit gathering  finance and treasury areas 
alco s primary responsibilities are to ensure the necessary level of funds are available for normal operations as well as maintain a contingency funding policy to ensure that liquidity stress events are quickly identified and management plans are in place to respond 
this is accomplished through the use of policies which establish limits and require measurements to monitor liquidity trends  including management reporting that identifies the amounts and costs of all available funding sources 
the company s current liquidity position is expected to be more than adequate to fund expected asset growth 
historically  our primary source of funds has been customer deposits 
scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds  while deposit inflows and unscheduled loan prepayments which are influenced by fluctuations in the general level of interest rates  returns available on other investments  competition  economic conditions  and other factors are less predictable 
liquidity from asset categories is provided through cash and interest bearing deposits with other banks  which totaled million at december   compared to million at december  additional asset liquidity sources include principal and interest payments from securities in the company s investment portfolio and cash flows from its amortizing loan portfolio 
liability liquidity sources include attracting deposits at competitive rates and maintaining wholesale borrowing short term borrowings and brokered cds credit relationships 
the company s loan to core deposit ratio decreased to at december   from at december   allowing the company to maintain low levels of wholesale borrowings which 
table of contents historically bear a higher cost than core deposits 
at december   the company had million in outstanding borrowings with the fhlb and no other federal fund borrowings 
average wholesale borrowings short term borrowing and brokered deposits were million during the year ended december  the company has no brokered deposits at december  and core deposits represent of the company s deposit base 
the company uses various forms of short term borrowings for cash management and liquidity purposes  regularly accessing its federal funds and fhlb lines to manage its daily cash position 
at december   the bank has approved federal funds purchase lines with seven correspondent banks with an aggregate credit line of million 
the bank also has a line of credit from the fhlb that is limited by the amount of eligible collateral available to secure it and the company s investment in fhlb stock 
borrowings under the fhlb line are required to be secured by unpledged securities and qualifying loans 
borrowings may also be used on a longer term basis to support expanded lending activities and to match the maturity or repricing intervals of assets 
available funding through correspondent lines and the fhlb at december   totaled million or of the company s earning assets 
available funding is comprised of million through the unsecured federal fund lines and million in secured fhlb borrowing capacity 
the company had million in securities available to be pledged as collateral for additional fhlb borrowings at december  access to funding through correspondent lines is dependent upon the cash position of the correspondent banks and there may be times when certain lines are not available 
in addition  certain lines require a one day rest period after a specified number of consecutive days of accessing the lines 
the company believes it has sufficient borrowing capacity and diversity in correspondent banks to meet its needs 
at the holding company level  our primary sources of funds are dividends paid from the bank and fee based subsidiaries  management fees assessed to the bank and the fee based business lines  proceeds from the issuance of common stock  and other capital markets activity 
the main use of this liquidity is the quarterly payment of dividends on our common and preferred stock  quarterly interest payments on the subordinated debentures and notes payable  payments for mergers and acquisitions activity  and payments for the salaries and benefits for the employees of the holding company 
the approval of the colorado state banking board is required prior to the declaration of any dividend by the bank if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year exceeds the total of its net profits for that year combined with the retained net profits for the preceding two years 
in addition  the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of provides that the bank cannot pay a dividend if it will cause the bank to be undercapitalized 
at december   the bank was restricted in its ability to pay dividends to the holding company as its cumulative earnings during and the prior two years  net of dividends paid during those years  was negative 
the company s ability to pay dividends on its common stock depends upon the availability of dividends from the bank  earnings from its fee based businesses  and upon the company s compliance with the capital adequacy guidelines of the federal reserve board of governors see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the holding company has a liquidity policy that requires the maintenance of at least months of liquidity on the balance sheet based on projected cash usages  exclusive of dividends from the bank 
at december   the holding company had a liquidity position that exceeds the policy limit and we believe the company has the ability to continue paying dividends 
at december   shareholders equity totaled million  an million increase from december  the increase was driven primarily by net income of million offset by a net decline of million relating to the redemption of the series b preferred stock and the issuance of the series c preferred stock see note to the consolidated financial statements  additional net unrealized losses of million relating to derivatives and available for sale securities  and common and preferred dividends of million 
we anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents  expected cash flows from operations together with alternative sources of funding are sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital  
table of contents loan originations  capital expenditures and other obligations for at least the next months 
we continually monitor existing and alternative financing sources to support our capital and liquidity needs  including but not limited to  debt issuance  common stock issuance and deposit funding sources 
based on our current financial condition and our results of operations  we believe the company will be able to sustain its ability to raise adequate capital through one or more of these financing sources 
we are subject to minimum risk based capital limitations as set forth by federal banking regulations at both the consolidated company level and the bank level 
under the risk based capital guidelines  different categories of assets  including certain off balance sheet items  such as loan commitments in excess of one year and letters of credit  are assigned different risk weights  based generally on the perceived credit risk of the asset 
these risk weights are multiplied by corresponding asset balances to determine a risk weighted asset base 
for purposes of the risk based capital guidelines  total capital is defined as the sum of tier and tier capital elements  with tier capital being limited to of tier capital 
tier capital includes  with certain restrictions  common shareholders equity  perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries 
tier capital includes  with certain limitations  perpetual preferred stock not included in tier capital  certain maturing capital instruments  and the allowance for loan and credit losses 
at december   the bank was well capitalized with a tier capital ratio of  and total capital ratio of 
the minimum ratios to be considered well capitalized under the risk based capital standards are and  respectively 
at the holding company level  the company s tier capital ratio at december   was  and its total capital ratio was 
in order to comply with the regulatory capital constraints  the company and its board of directors constantly monitor the capital level and its anticipated needs based on the company s growth 
the company has identified sources of additional capital that could be used if needed  and monitors the costs and benefits of these sources  which include both the public and private markets 
the company has issued a total of million of trust preferred securities through statutory trusts that are not included in the company s consolidated financial statements 
although the accounts of the statutory trust  capital trust ii and capital trust iii are not included in the company s consolidated financial statements  million in trust preferred securities issued by the trusts are included in tier capital for regulatory capital purposes as allowed by the federal reserve board at december  under rules that became effective march   the aggregate amount of trust preferred securities and certain other capital elements are limited to of tier capital elements  net of goodwill that has been reduced by any associated deferred tax liability 
the amount of trust preferred securities and certain other elements in excess of the limit can be included in tier capital  subject to certain restrictions 
upon adoption of this rule  the company maintained its well capitalized status 
the company s consolidated financial statements do not reflect various off balance sheet commitments that are made in the normal course of business  which may involve some liquidity risk 
off balance sheet arrangements are discussed in the following contractual obligations and commitments section 
the company has commitments to extend credit under lines of credit and stand by letters of credit 
the company has also committed to investing in certain partnerships 
see the following section of this report and note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on these commitments

principal repayment of the junior subordinated debentures is assumed to be at the contractual maturity while principal repayment of the subordinated notes payable is assumed to be its first call date see note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest on the junior subordinated debentures is calculated at the fixed rate associated with the applicable hedging instrument through the instrument maturity date see note to the consolidated financial statements and then at the current variable rate through contractual maturity and is reported in the due within categories during which the interest expense is expected to be incurred

these financial instruments include legally binding commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit and involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized on the balance sheet 
credit risk is the principal risk associated with these instruments 
the contractual amounts of these instruments represent the amount of credit risk should the instruments be fully drawn upon and the customer defaults 

table of contents to control the credit risk associated with entering into commitments and issuing letters of credit  the company uses the same credit quality  collateral policies and monitoring controls in making commitments and letters of credit as it does with its lending activities 
the company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by the company upon extension of credit  is based on management s credit evaluation 
legally binding commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments may expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
standby letters of credit obligate the company to meet certain financial obligations of its customers if  under the contractual terms of the agreement  the customers are unable to do so 
the financial standby letters of credit issued by the company are irrevocable 
payment is only guaranteed under these letters of credit upon the borrower s failure to perform its obligations to the beneficiary 
approximately million of total commitments at december   represent commitments to extend credit at fixed rates of interest  which exposes the company to some degree of interest rate risk 
the company has also entered into interest rate swap agreements under which it is required to either receive or pay cash to a counterparty depending on changes in interest rates 
the interest rate swaps are carried at their fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with the fair value representing the net present value of expected future cash receipts or payments based on market interest rates at the balance sheet date 
interest rate swaps recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at december   do not represent amounts that will ultimately be received or paid under the contract and are therefore excluded from the table above 
effects of inflation and changing prices the primary impact of inflation on our operations is increased operating costs 
unlike most retail or manufacturing companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution such as the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  the impact of interest rates on a financial institution s performance is generally greater than the impact of inflation 
although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction  or to the same extent  as the prices of goods and services  increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates 
over short periods of time  interest rates may not move in the same direction  or at the same magnitude  as inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management asset liability management is concerned with the timing and magnitude of repricing assets compared to liabilities 
it is our objective to generate stable growth in net interest income and to attempt to control risks associated with interest rate movements 
in general  our strategy is to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income by maintaining a favorable match between the maturities or repricing dates of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
we adjust interest sensitivity during the year through changes in the mix of assets and liabilities 
our asset and liability management strategy is formulated and monitored by the alco committee  in accordance with policies approved by the board of directors of the bank 
this committee meets regularly to review  among other things  the sensitivity of our assets and liabilities to interest rate changes  the book and market values of assets and liabilities  unrealized gains and losses  purchase and sale activity  and maturities of investments and borrowings 
the alco committee also approves and establishes pricing and funding decisions with respect to our overall asset and liability composition 
the committee reviews our liquidity  cash flow flexibility  maturities of investments  deposits and borrowings  deposit activity  current market conditions  and general levels of interest rates 
to effectively measure and manage interest rate risk  we use simulation analysis to determine the impact on net interest income of changes in interest rates under various interest rate 
table of contents scenarios 
from these simulations  interest rate risk is quantified and appropriate strategies are developed and implemented 
the following table presents an analysis of the interest rate sensitivity inherent in our net interest income for the next months and market value of equity 
the interest rate scenario presented in the table includes interest rates at december   as adjusted by rate changes upward of up to basis points ramped over a month period 
due to the current interest rate environment  the fomc has a basis point target federal funds rate at december   with prime set at basis points above the fomc target  the downward movement analysis was limited to a basis point change 
the market value sensitivity analysis presented includes assumptions that i the composition of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities existing at december   will remain constant  and ii that changes in market rates are parallel and instantaneous across the yield curve regardless of duration or repricing characteristics of specific assets or liabilities 
further  the analysis does not contemplate any actions that we might undertake in response to changes in market interest rates 
accordingly  this analysis is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect actual changes in market rates will have on us 
change in interest rates in basis points impact on net interest income n a market value of equity n a our results of operations depend significantly on net interest income 
like most financial institutions  our interest income and cost of funds are affected by general economic conditions and by competition in the marketplace 
rising and falling interest rate environments can have various impacts on net interest income  depending on the interest rate profile ie  the difference between the repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the relative changes in interest rates that occur when various assets and liabilities reprice  unscheduled repayments of loans and investments  early withdrawals of deposits  and other factors 
as a general rule  banks with positive interest rate gaps are more likely to be susceptible to declines in net interest income in periods of falling interest rates  while banks with negative interest rate gaps are more likely to experience declines in net interest income in periods of rising interest rates 
at december   our cumulative interest rate gap was a positive 
therefore  assuming no change in our gap position  a rise in interest rates is likely to result in increased net interest income  while a decline in interest rates is likely to result in decreased net interest income 
this is a point in time position that is continually changing and is not indicative of our position at any other time 
while the gap position is a useful tool in measuring interest rate risk and contributes toward effective asset and liability management  shortcomings are inherent in gap analysis since certain assets and liabilities may not move proportionally as interest rates change 
consequently  in addition to gap analysis  we use the simulation model discussed above to test the interest rate sensitivity of net interest income and the balance sheet 
the following table sets forth the estimated maturity or repricing  and the resulting interest rate gap  of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  all amounts in the table are based on contractual repricing schedules 
actual prepayment and withdrawal experience may vary significantly from the assumptions reflected in the table

to manage the relationship of our interest earning assets and liabilities  we evaluate the following factors liquidity  equity  debt capital ratio  anticipated prepayment rates  portfolio maturities  maturing assets and maturing liabilities 
our asset liability management committee is responsible for establishing procedures that enable us to achieve our goals while adhering to prudent banking practices and existing loan and investment policies 
we have focused on maintaining balance between interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities and repricing frequencies 
an important element of this focus has been to emphasize variable rate loans and investments funded by deposits that also mature or reprice over periods of months or less 
the following table presents  at december   loans by maturity in each major category of our portfolio 
actual maturities may differ from the contractual maturities shown below as a result of renewals and prepayments 
loan renewals are evaluated in the same manner as new credit applications 
at december  less than one to over in thousands one year five years five years total commercial real estate mortgage land acquisition development real estate construction consumer other total loans of the million of loans with maturities of one year or more  approximately million were fixed rate loans and million were variable rate loans at december  to augment our asset and liability management strategy  we also began using interest rate swaps on our loan portfolio in  with the overall goal of minimizing the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our net 
table of contents interest margin 
interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed rate and variable rate interest payment obligations without the exchange of the underlying notional amounts 
since we implemented the program in  we have entered into different interest rate swap agreements  all of which had matured by the end of under the interest rate swap agreements  we received a fixed rate and paid a variable rate based on the prime rate 
the swaps qualified as cash flow hedges under asc topic  derivatives and hedging asc  and were designated as hedges of the variability of cash flows we received from certain of our prime indexed loans 
in accordance with asc  these swap agreements were measured at fair value and reported as assets or liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition 
the portion of the change in the fair value of the swaps that was deemed effective in hedging the cash flows of the designated assets were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax effects oci and reclassified into interest income when such cash flows occur in the future 
any ineffectiveness resulting from the hedges was recorded as a gain or loss in the consolidated statements of operations as a part of noninterest income 
during  and  net interest income was increased million  million and million  respectively  from the settlement of the interest rate swaps 
in february  the company initiated a new series of interest rate swap transactions designated as cash flow hedges 
the intent of the transactions was to fix the effective interest rate of payments due on its junior subordinated debentures with the objective of reducing the company s exposure to adverse changes in cash flows relating to payments on its libor based floating rate debt 
the swap agreements have a total notional value of million  will fix the interest rates between and and will mature over varying lengths of time from five and years 
these interest rate swaps were effective for cash settlements beginning in february and net interest income decreased million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively  from the settlement of payments on the swaps
