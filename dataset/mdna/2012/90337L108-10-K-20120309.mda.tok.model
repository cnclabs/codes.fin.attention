item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive summary our business 
we operate outpatient physical therapy clinics that provide preventative and post operative care for a variety of orthopedic related disorders and sports related injuries  treatment for neurologically related injuries and rehabilitation of injured workers 
during and  we completed the following acquisitions acquisition date interest acquired number of clinics july acquisition july february acquisition february december  acquisition december december  acquisition december the three acquisitions in are hereinafter referred to collectively as the acquisitions 
no clinics were acquired in the results of operations of the acquired clinics have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of their acquisition 
at december   we operated clinics in states  inclusive of two physician services clinics 
the average age of our clinics at december   was years 
of the clinics  we developed of the clinics and acquired in  we opened clinics  acquired and closed in addition to our owned clinics  we also manage physical therapy facilities for third parties  primarily physicians  with third party facilities under management as of december  critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial position involving significant estimates requiring our judgment 
our critical accounting policies are revenues from physician services  sold primarily through franchisee arrangements  are considered multiple deliverables training and ongoing services 
each component can be purchased separately 
revenue is recognized over the period of the respective services are provided 
revenue recognition 
revenues are recognized in the period in which services are rendered 
net patient revenues patient revenues less estimated contractual adjustments are reported at the estimated net realizable amounts from insurance companies  third party payors  patients and others for services rendered 
the company has agreements with third party payors that provide for payments to the company at contracted amounts different from its established rates 
the allowance for estimated contractual adjustments is based on terms of payor contracts and historical collection and write off experience 
contractual allowances 
contractual allowances result from the differences between the rates charged for services performed and expected reimbursements by both insurance companies and government sponsored healthcare programs for such services 
medicare regulations and the various third party payors and managed care contracts are often complex and may include multiple reimbursement mechanisms payable for the services provided in our clinics 
we estimate contractual allowances based on our interpretation of the applicable 
table of contents regulations  payor contracts and historical calculations 
each month the company estimates its contractual allowance for each clinic based on payor contracts and the historical collection experience of the clinic and applies an appropriate contractual allowance reserve percentage to the gross accounts receivable balances for each payor of the clinic 
based on our historical experience  calculating the contractual allowance reserve percentage at the payor level is sufficient to allow us to provide the necessary detail and accuracy with our collectibility estimates 
however  the services authorized and provided and related reimbursement are subject to interpretation that could result in payments that differ from our estimates 
payor terms are periodically revised necessitating continual review and assessment of the estimates made by management 
our billing system may not capture the exact change in our contractual allowance reserve estimate from period to period 
therefore  in order to assess the accuracy of our revenues and hence our contractual allowance reserves  our management regularly compares its cash collections to corresponding net revenues measured both in the aggregate and on a clinic by clinic basis 
in the aggregate  the historical difference between net revenues and corresponding cash collections has generally reflected a difference within approximately of net revenues 
additionally  analysis of subsequent period s contractual write offs on a payor basis reflects a difference within approximately between the actual aggregate contractual reserve percentage as compared to the estimated contractual allowance reserve percentage associated with the same period end balance 
as a result  we believe that a reasonable likely change in the contractual allowance reserve estimate would not be more than at december  for purposes of demonstrating the sensitivity of this estimate on the company s financial condition  a one percent increase or decrease in our aggregate contractual allowance reserve percentage would decrease or increase  respectively  net patient revenue by approximately  for the year ended december  management believes the changes in the estimate of the contractual allowance reserve for the periods ended december   and have not been material to the statement of operations 
the following table sets forth information regarding our patient accounts receivable as of the dates indicated in thousands december  gross patient accounts receivable less contractual allowances subtotal accounts receivable less allowance for doubtful accounts net patient accounts receivable the following table presents our patient accounts receivable aging by payor class as of the dates indicated in thousands accounts receivable by payor class december  december  current to current to payor days days total days days total managed care commercial plans medicare medicaid workers compensation self pay other totals workers compensation is paid by state administrators or their designated agents 
other includes primarily litigation claims and  to a lesser extent  vehicular insurance claims 

table of contents reimbursement for medicare beneficiaries is based upon a fee schedule published by hhs 
for a more complete description of our third party revenue sources  see business sources of revenue in item allowance for doubtful accounts 
we determine allowances for doubtful accounts based on the specific agings and payor classifications at each clinic 
we review the accounts receivable aging and rely on prior experience with particular payors to determine an appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts 
historically  clinics that have a large number of aged accounts generally have less favorable collection experience  and thus  require a higher allowance 
accounts that are ultimately determined to be uncollectible are written off against our bad debt allowance 
the amount of our aggregate allowance for doubtful accounts is regularly reviewed for adequacy in light of current and historical experience 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold  the amount to be recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
the company does not believe that it has any significant uncertain tax positions at december   nor is this expected to change within the next twelve months due to the settlement and expiration of statutes of limitation 
the company did not have any accrued interest or penalties associated with any unrecognized tax benefits nor was any interest expense recognized during the twelve months ended december  and carrying value of long lived assets 
our property and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill collectively  our long lived assets comprise a significant portion of our total assets 
the accounting standards require that we periodically  and upon the occurrence of certain events  assess the recoverability of our long lived assets 
if the carrying value of our property and equipment exceeds their undiscounted cash flows  we are required to write the carrying value down to estimated fair value 
goodwill 
the fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually and upon the occurrence of certain events  and are written down to fair value if considered impaired 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis in our third quarter by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to the carrying value of the reporting unit including related goodwill 
we operate a one segment business which is made up of various clinics within partnerships 
a reporting unit refers to the acquired interest of a single clinic or group of clinics 
local management typically continues to manage the acquired clinic or group of clinics 
for each clinic or group of clinics  we maintain discrete financial information and both corporate and local management regularly review the operating results 
we did not combine any of the reporting units for impairment testing in any year presented 
for each purchase of the equity interest  goodwill  if any  is assigned to the respective clinic or group of clinics  if deemed appropriate 
the evaluation of goodwill in  and did not result in any goodwill amounts that were deemed impaired 
an impairment loss 
table of contents generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the net assets of the reporting unit  inclusive of goodwill and other intangible assets  exceed the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using two factors i earnings prior to taxes  depreciation and amortization for the reporting unit multiplied by a price earnings ratio used in the industry and ii a discounted cash flow analysis 
a weight is assigned to each factor and the sum of the each weight multiplied by the factor is considered the estimated fair value 
for  the factors ie 
price earnings ratio  discount rate and residual capitalization rate were updated to reflect current market conditions

table of contents factors affecting future results the risks related to our business and operations include the uncertain economic conditions and the historically high unemployment rate in the united states may have material adverse impacts on our business and financial condition that we currently cannot predict 
we depend upon reimbursement by third party payors including medicare and medicaid 
changes as a result of healthcare reform legislation may affect our business 
we depend upon the cultivation and maintenance of relationships with the physicians in our markets 
we also depend upon our ability to recruit and retain experienced physical therapists 
our revenues may fluctuate due to weather 
our operations are subject to extensive regulation 
we operate in a highly competitive industry 
we may incur closure costs and losses 
future acquisitions may use significant resources  may be unsuccessful and could expose us to unforeseen liabilities 
certain of our internal controls  particularly as they relate to billings and cash collections  are largely decentralized at our clinic locations
