critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make 
table of contents estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements include significant estimates and assumptions 
merchandise inventories merchandise inventories  net of an allowance for excess quantities and obsolescence  are stated at the lower of cost weighted average method or market 
to determine if the value of our inventory should be marked down below cost  we consider current and anticipated demand  customer preferences  age of the merchandise and fashion trends 
our inventory value is adjusted periodically to reflect current market conditions  which requires management judgments that may significantly affect the ending inventory valuation  as well as gross margin 
the significant estimates used in inventory valuation are obsolescence including excess and slow moving inventory and lower of cost or market reserves and estimates of inventory shrinkage 
we reserve for obsolescence based on historical trends  aging reports  specific identification and our estimates of future retail sales and selling prices 
reserves for shrinkage are estimated and recorded throughout the year  at the concept and channel level  as a percentage of net sales based on historical shrinkage results  expectations of future shrinkage and current inventory levels 
actual shrinkage is recorded at year end based on the results of our physical inventory count and can vary from our estimates due to such factors as changes in operations within our distribution centers  the mix of our inventory which ranges from large furniture to small tabletop items and execution against loss prevention initiatives in our stores  distribution centers  off site storage locations  and with our third party transportation providers 
accordingly  there is no remaining shrinkage reserve balance at year end 
due to these factors  our obsolescence and shrinkage reserves contain uncertainties 
both estimates have calculations that require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding a number of factors  including market conditions  the selling environment  historical results and current inventory trends 
if actual obsolescence or shrinkage estimates change from our original estimate  we will adjust our reserves accordingly throughout the year 
management does not believe that changes in the assumptions used in these estimates would have a significant effect on our inventory balances 
we have made no material changes to our assumptions included in the calculations of the obsolescence and shrinkage reserves throughout the year 
in addition  we do not believe a change in our inventory reserves would have a material effect on net earnings 
as of january  and january   our inventory obsolescence reserves were  and  respectively 
advertising and prepaid catalog expenses advertising expenses consist of media and production costs related to catalog mailings  e commerce advertising and other direct marketing activities 
all advertising costs are expensed as incurred  or upon the release of the initial advertisement  with the exception of prepaid catalog expenses 
prepaid catalog expenses consist primarily of third party incremental direct costs  including creative design  paper  printing  postage and mailing costs for all of our direct response catalogs 
such costs are capitalized as prepaid catalog expenses and are amortized over their expected period of future benefit 
such amortization is based upon the ratio of actual direct to customer revenues to the total of actual and estimated future direct to customer revenues on an individual catalog basis 
estimated future direct to customer revenues are based upon various factors such as the total number of catalogs and pages circulated  the probability and magnitude of consumer response and the assortment of merchandise offered 
each catalog is generally fully amortized over a six to nine month period  with the majority of the amortization occurring within the first four to five months 
prepaid catalog expenses are evaluated for realizability on a monthly basis by comparing the carrying amount associated with each catalog to the estimated probable remaining future profitability remaining direct to customer net revenues less merchandise cost of goods sold  selling expenses and catalog related costs associated with that catalog 
if the catalog is not expected to be profitable  the carrying amount of the catalog is impaired accordingly

depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
we review the carrying value of all long lived assets for impairment  primarily at a store level  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
our impairment analyses determine whether projected cash flows from operations are sufficient to recover the carrying value of these assets 
impairment results when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows over its remaining useful life 
for store impairment  our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows over the store lease term generally to years is based upon our experience  historical operations of the stores and estimates of future store profitability and economic conditions 
the future estimates of store profitability and economic conditions require estimating such factors as sales growth  gross margin  employment rates  lease escalations  inflation and the overall economics of the retail industry  and are therefore subject to variability and difficult to predict 
if a long lived asset is found to be impaired  the amount recognized for impairment is equal to the difference between the net carrying value and the asset s fair value 
long lived assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using level inputs as defined in the fair value hierarchy 
the fair value is estimated based upon future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk and that approximates our weighted average cost of capital 
self insured liabilities we are primarily self insured for workers compensation  employee health benefits and product and general liability claims 
we record self insurance liabilities based on claims filed  including the development of those claims  and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
factors affecting this estimate include future inflation rates  changes in severity  benefit level changes  medical costs and claim settlement patterns 
should a different amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated  or costs of the claims increase or decrease beyond what was anticipated  reserves may need to be adjusted accordingly 
we determine our workers compensation liability and product and general liability claims reserves based on an actuarial analysis of historical claims data 
self insurance reserves for employee health benefits  workers compensation and product and general liability claims were  and  as of january  and january   respectively  and are recorded within accrued salaries  benefits and other within our consolidated balance sheets 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation arrangements by measuring and recording compensation expense in our consolidated financial statements for all stock based awards using a fair value method 
for stock options and stock settled stock appreciation rights option awards  fair value is determined using the black scholes valuation model  while restricted stock units are valued using the closing price of our stock on the date prior to the date of grant 
significant factors affecting the fair value of option awards include the estimated future volatility of our stock price and the estimated expected term until the option award is exercised  converted or cancelled 
the fair value of the award is amortized over the requisite service period 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements 
we record reserves for estimates of probable settlements of foreign and domestic tax audits 
at any one time  many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions 
the results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues 
additionally  our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of our earnings 

table of contents new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income 
this guidance revises the manner in which entities present comprehensive income in their financial statements 
the new guidance removes the presentation options in previous guidance and requires entities to report components of comprehensive income in either a continuous statement of comprehensive income or two separate but consecutive statements 
the new guidance does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income 
this amended guidance is effective for our first quarter of fiscal and will only impact the presentation of comprehensive income within our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment 
this guidance is intended to simplify how entities test goodwill for impairment 
the new guidance permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test described in topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
this amended guidance is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include significant deterioration of the us and foreign markets  changes in us interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  including the devaluation of the us dollar  and the effects of uncertain economic forces which may affect the prices we pay our vendors in the foreign countries in which we do business 
we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk as of january   our line of credit facility was the only instrument we held with a variable interest rate which could  if drawn upon  subject us to risks associated with changes in that interest rate 
as of january   there were no amounts outstanding under our credit facility 
in addition  we have fixed and variable income investments consisting of short term investments classified as cash and cash equivalents  which are also affected by changes in market interest rates 
as of january   our investments  made primarily in money market funds and highly liquid us treasury bills  are stated at cost and approximate their fair values 
foreign currency risks we purchase a significant amount of inventory from vendors outside of the us in transactions that are denominated in us dollars 
approximately of our international purchase transactions are in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the euro 
any currency risks related to these international purchase transactions were not significant to us during fiscal and fiscal since we pay for the majority of our international purchases in us dollars  however  a decline in the us dollar relative to other foreign currencies would subject us to risks associated with increased purchasing costs from our vendors in their effort to offset any lost profits associated with any currency devaluation 
we cannot predict with certainty the effect these increased costs may have on our financial statements or results of operations 
in addition  as of january   our retail stores in canada and our limited operations in asia and europe  expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
although these exchange rate fluctuations have not been material to us in the past  we may enter into foreign currency contracts in the future to minimize any currency remeasurement risk associated with the intercompany assets and liabilities of our subsidiaries 
we did not enter into any foreign currency contracts during fiscal or fiscal
