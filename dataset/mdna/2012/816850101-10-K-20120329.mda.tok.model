item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
prior to the completion of the acquisition of gennum  we did not have any material outstanding indebtedness 
as a result of the incurrence of such debt  we expect our consolidated interest expense will commence and our ability to make payments on amounts borrowed under our credit facilities  and to fund our operations will depend on our ability to generate substantial operating cash flow 
our cash flow generation will depend on our future performance  which will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and  if we cannot service our debt  we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital investments  selling assets  or seeking additional equity capital 
we may not be able to  if required  effect these actions on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
because of these and other factors beyond our control  we may be unable to pay the interest on or other amounts in respect of our indebtedness 
restrictive covenants in the credit agreement governing our senior secured first lien credit facilities may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies 
the credit agreement governing our senior secured first lien credit facilities contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long term best interests 
the credit agreement includes covenants restricting  among other things  our and our subsidiaries ability to incur or guarantee additional debt or issue certain preferred stock  pay dividends or make distributions on our capital stock or redeem  repurchase or retire our capital stock  make certain investments and acquisitions  create liens on our or our subsidiaries assets  enter into transactions with affiliates  merge or consolidate with another person or sell or otherwise dispose of substantially all of our assets  make certain payments in respect of other material indebtedness  alter the business that we conduct  and make certain capital expenditures 
under the credit agreement  we are required to maintain a total leverage ratio and an interest expense coverage ratio 
our ability to meet such financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet such ratios 
the credit agreement also contains various covenants and restrictions and a breach of any covenant or restriction could result in a default under our credit agreement 
if any such default occurs  the lenders may elect after the expiration of any applicable notice or grace periods to declare all outstanding borrowings  together with accrued and unpaid interest and other amounts payable thereunder  to be immediately due and payable 
further  following an event of default under our credit facilities  the lenders will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that debt 
if the debt under our credit facilities were to be accelerated  our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full that debt that may become due as a result of that acceleration 
we rely on certain critical information systems for the operation of our business we maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business 
these information systems include telecommunications  the internet  our corporate intranet  various computer hardware and software applications  network communications  and e mail 
these information systems may be owned by us or by our outsource providers or even third parties such as vendors and contractors and may be maintained by us or by such providers or third parties 
these information systems are subject to attacks  failures  and access denials from a number of potential sources including viruses  destructive or inadequate code  power failures  and physical damage to computers  hard drives  communication lines and networking equipment 
to the extent that these information systems are under our control  we have implemented security procedures  such as virus protection software and emergency recovery processes  to address the outlined risks  however  security procedures for information systems cannot be guaranteed to be failsafe and our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business 
the costs associated with our indemnification of certain customers  distributors  and other parties could be higher in future periods in the normal course of our business  we indemnify other parties  including customers  distributors  and lessors  with respect to certain matters 
these obligations typically arise pursuant to contracts under which we agree to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations and covenants related to certain matters  such as acts or omissions of our employees  infringement of third party intellectual property rights  and certain environmental matters 
we have not incurred any significant expense as a result of agreements of this type in at least a decade  but there can be no assurances that we will not incur expense under these indemnification provisions in the future 
we have also entered into agreements with our current and former directors and certain of our current and former executives indemnifying them against certain liabilities incurred in connection with their duties 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations with respect to our current and former directors and employees  as does the california labor code 
we cannot estimate the amount of potential future payments  if any  that we might be required to make as a result of these agreements 
prior to fiscal year  we had not incurred any significant expense as a result of agreements of this type for at least a decade 

table of contents our share price could be subject to extreme price fluctuations  and stockholders could have difficulty trading shares historically  the market for the stock of high technology companies has been volatile  and the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations 
fluctuations could be in response to items such as operating results  announcements of technological innovations  or market conditions for technology stocks in general 
additionally  the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies 
these market fluctuations  as well as general economic conditions  may adversely affect the price of our common stock 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against a company following periods of volatility in the company s stock price 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for information regarding a class action suit filed in fiscal year relating to our past stock option practices 
securities class action litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention and resources 
in addition  the future sale of a substantial number of shares of common stock by us or by our existing stockholders or option holders including directors  officers  and employees  some of whom hold stock options that are approaching their expiration date may have an adverse impact on the market price of the shares of common stock 
there can be no assurance that the trading price of our common stock will remain at or near its current level

table of contents net sales 
net sales for fiscal year were million  an increase of from million for fiscal year fiscal year revenues increased driven by strengthening demand in the communications and consumer end markets 
fiscal year was also impacted by softening global economic conditions that resulted in a reduction in orders of our component products during the fiscal year 
higher revenue in the communications end market was attributed to the impact of strengthening demand for our g and g communications infrastructure products in our advanced communications product line 
higher revenues in the high end consumer end market were driven by strengthening demand for protection products in consumer applications including lcd tvs  smartphones and tablet computers 
computing revenues were roughly flat 
within the industrial category  lower revenue was attributed to softer demand from the military segment in our power management and high reliability and advanced communications product lines 
gross profit 
gross profit was million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
our gross margin was for fiscal year  up from in fiscal year gross profit margins for fiscal year were positively impacted by higher revenues  increased manufacturing volumes and the impact of reduced equity compensation expenses attributed to staffing reductions associated with a reduction in workforce 
these factors offset the impact of a higher mix of consumer and computing revenues relative to communications and industrial revenues

sales change selling  general and administrative product development and engineering intangible amortization and impairments total operating costs and expenses selling  general administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year decreased by million or driven by the reduction in class action lawsuit expenses as the company settled the litigation in august  and lower equity compensation expenses partially offset by the impact of transaction expenses  reorganization charges and the impact of higher staffing and information technology infrastructure upgrade spending 
approximately million of transaction expenses attributed to the acquisition of gennum and the evaluation of other acquisition candidates were recorded in fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal years and include approximately million and million net of insurance recoveries of million  respectively  for legal and other professional services incurred in connection with matters related to our historical stock option practices  including the government inquiries  the related litigation  and other associated matters

the rate for fiscal year reflects the impact of favorable trends in our regional mix of income 
we expect our regional income trends to remain favorable 
however  certain items which occurred in fiscal year are not expected to recur in fiscal year one such item includes a one time benefit of million related to a release of previously recorded reserves for uncertain tax positions  as a result of statutes of limitations for the taxing authority to challenge the positions expiring 
in fiscal year  our tax provision was adversely effected by a net increase to our valuation allowance of million 
this net increase was primarily the result of utilization concerns related to our california net operating losses due to a projected lower california apportionment in future years 
in fiscal year  we concluded that million of foreign subsidiary earnings were no longer considered to be permanently reinvested offshore 
in connection with the acquisition of gennum in march  we reviewed this prior assertion and concluded that only million of foreign subsidiary earnings were no longer permanently reinvested offshore resulting in million of foreign subsidiary earnings deemed to be permanently reinvested 
this change in assertion will result in recording a discrete adjustment to its tax provision in the first quarter of fiscal year the impact of this change in assertion is expected to result in the recognition of a million tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year fiscal year compared with fiscal year presented below is our estimate of sales by end market

net sales for fiscal year were million  an increase of from million for fiscal year while fiscal year revenue increased significantly on strengthening demand across the majority of our product lines  revenues also benefited from the impact of the addition of the full year of smi acquisition related revenues  whereas fiscal year only reflected smi acquisition related revenues for the period of december  through january  the acquisition of smi provided us with products that shared similar business processes  markets and intellectual property 
post acquisition  we quickly took actions to fully integrate smi into our operations 
fiscal year was also impacted by deteriorating global economic conditions that resulted in a significant reduction in orders of our component products during the first half of the fiscal year 
demand and orders increased during the second half of fiscal year as business conditions began to improve 
revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal year also benefited from an extra week in the fiscal quarter 
higher revenue in the communications end market was driven by higher unit volumes of advanced communications products  including the benefits from the unit volumes attributable to the acquired smi business  and power management products 
higher revenues in the high end consumer end market were driven by strengthening demand for protection products 
the reduction in computing revenues was attributed to the overall softness in the macro economy and the strategy to exit lower margin areas of the computing end market 
within the industrial category  lower revenue was attributed to the overall softness in the macro economy and the impact of a slowdown in military funding which impacted the power management and high reliability product group 
gross profit

interest income decreased in fiscal year as a result of the continued environment of low interest rates and the focus on protecting principal by limiting the investment of new and maturing funds to the higher quality yet lower yielding investments

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements depend on a variety of factors  including but not limited to  the rate of increase or decrease in our existing business base  the success  timing and amount of investment required to bring new products to market  revenue growth or decline  and potential acquisitions 
we believe that we have the financial resources necessary to meet business requirements for the next months  including funds needed for working capital requirements 
as of january   our total shareholders equity was million 
at that date we also had approximately million in cash and short term investments  as well as million in long term investments 
we have no outstanding debt as of january  on march   we entered into a credit agreement with the lenders and jefferies finance llc  as administrative agent

we intend to continue to focus on those areas that have shown potential for viable and profitable market opportunities  which may require additional investment in equipment and will require continued  and perhaps additional  investment in design and application engineers aimed at developing new products 
certain of these expenditures  particularly the addition of design engineers  do not generate significant payback in the short term 
we plan to finance these expenditures with cash generated by our operations and our existing cash balances 
a meaningful portion of our capital resources  and the liquidity they represent  are held by our foreign subsidiaries 
as of january   our foreign subsidiaries held approximately million of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments compared to million at january  if we needed these funds for investment in domestic operations  any repatriation  such as that which occurred in fiscal year to partially fund the acquisition of smi  could result in increased tax liabilities 
one of our primary goals is to constantly improve the cash flows from our existing business activities 
our cash  cash equivalents and investments noted above  give us the flexibility to leverage our free cash flow to return value to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases while also pursuing business improvement opportunities 

table of contents additionally  we will continue to seek to maintain and improve our existing business performance with necessary capital expenditures and  potentially  acquisitions that may further improve our base business with prospects of a proper return 
acquisitions might be made for either cash or stock consideration  or a combination of both 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to net income adjusted by non cash items plus fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities 
investing activities cash used for investing activities is primarily attributable to capital expenditures  purchases of investments  offset by proceeds from the sales maturities of investments 
our marketable securities investment portfolio is invested primarily in highly rated securities  generally with a minimum rating of a a or equivalent 
capital expenditures  net proceeds from disposals  were million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year financing activities cash provided by financing activities is primarily attributable to the proceeds from stock option exercises offset by the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program and the payment of statutory tax withholding obligations related to the vesting of restricted stock  and stock repurchases 
for fiscal year  cash from the exercise of stock options were million compared with million in fiscal year we do not directly control the timing of the exercise of stock options 
such exercises are decisions made by those grantees and are influenced most directly by the level of our stock price and the expiration dates of stock awards 
such proceeds are difficult to forecast  resulting from several factors which are outside our control 
we believe that such proceeds will remain an important secondary source of cash after cash flow from operating activities 
we currently have in effect a stock repurchase program 
this program represents one of our principal efforts to return value to our shareholders 
in fiscal year  we repurchased million shares under this program for million

the cash surrender value of our company owned life insurance was million as of january  and million as of january   and is included in other assets 
we have million of accrued taxes for uncertain tax positions 
we believe that it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately million within twelve months as a result of expiring statutes 
inflation inflationary factors have not had a significant effect on our performance over the past several years 
a significant increase in inflation would affect our future performance 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
in connection with the preparation of our financial statements  we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events  and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and the related disclosures 
we base our assumptions  estimates and judgments on historical experience  current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared 
on a regular basis  management reviews the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with gaap 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  included in item  of this report on form k 
we believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  and they require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we have reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
accounting for temporary and long term investments our temporary and long term investments consist of government  corporate obligations and bank time deposits 
temporary investments mature within twelve months of the balance sheet date 
long term investments have maturities in excess of one year from the date of the balance sheet 
we classify our investments as available for sale because we expect to possibly sell some securities prior to maturity 
we include any unrealized gain or loss  net of tax  in the comprehensive income portion of our consolidated statements of stockholders equity 

table of contents after determining the fair value of our available for sale investments  unrealized gains or losses on these investments are recorded to other comprehensive income  until either the investment is sold or we determine that a decline in value is other than temporary 
determining whether a decline in fair value is other than temporary requires management judgment based on the specific facts and circumstances of each investment 
for investments in debt instruments  these judgments primarily consider the financial condition and liquidity of the issuer  the issuer s credit rating  and any specific events that may cause us to believe that the debt instrument will not mature and be paid in full  and our ability and intent to hold the investment to maturity 
if management decides not to hold an investment until maturity  it may result in the recognition of other than temporary impairment 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
if we are aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  we record an allowance to reduce the net receivable to the amount we reasonably believe we will be able to collect from the customer 
for all other customers  we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  the current business environment  the size and number of certain large accounts and our historical experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or if economic conditions worsen  additional allowances may be required in the future 
revenue and cost of sales we recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable 
product design and engineering revenue is recognized during the period in which services are performed 
we record a provision for estimated sales returns in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
we base these estimates on historical sales returns and other known factors 
actual returns could be different from our estimates and current provisions for sales returns and allowances  resulting in future charges to earnings 
we defer revenue recognition on shipment of products to certain customers  principally distributors  under agreements which provide for limited pricing credits or product return privileges  until these products are sold through to end users or the return privileges lapse 
for sales subject to certain pricing credits or return privileges  the amount of future pricing credits or inventory returns cannot be reasonably estimated given the relatively long period in which a particular product may be held by the customer 
therefore  we have concluded that sales to customers under these agreements are not fixed and determinable at the date of the sale and revenue recognition has been deferred 
we estimate the deferred gross margin on these sales by applying an average gross profit margin to the actual gross sales 
the average gross profit margin is calculated for each category of material using current standard costs 
the deferred gross margin does not include any adjustments for sales returns 
the estimated deferred gross margin on these sales  where there are no outstanding receivables  is recorded on the balance sheet under the heading of deferred revenue 
there were no significant impairments of deferred cost of sales in fiscal year or fiscal year the following table summarizes the deferred net revenue balance deferred revenue in thousands january  january  deferred revenue deferred cost of revenue deferred revenue  net deferred product design and engineering recoveries total deferred revenue inventory valuation our inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and consist of materials  labor and overhead 
we determine the cost of inventory by the first in  first out method 
at each balance sheet date  we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence 
this evaluation includes analyses of sales levels by product and projections of future demand 
in order to state our inventory at lower of cost or market  we maintain specific reserves against our inventory which serve to write down our inventories to a new cost basis 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  a write down of inventory may be required  and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period the revision is made 

table of contents contingencies and litigation we record accruals for contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
these accruals are adjusted periodically as assessments change or additional information becomes available 
individually significant contingent losses are accrued when probable and reasonably estimable 
legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency are accrued when probable and reasonably estimable 
the amount we accrue is based on reviews by outside counsel  in house counsel and management and some of the significant factors considered in the review of these reserves are as follows the actual costs incurred by the company  the development of the company s legal defense strategy and structure in light of the scope of its litigation  the number of cases being brought against the company  the costs and outcomes of completed trials and the most current information regarding anticipated timing  progression  and related costs of pre trial activities and trials in the associated litigation 
the amount of accrued reserves would represent our best estimate of the minimum amount of defense costs to be incurred in connection with its outstanding litigation  however  events such as additional trials and other events that could arise in the course of its litigation could affect the ultimate amount of legal defense costs to be incurred by the company 
we will continue to monitor our legal defense costs and review the adequacy of the associated reserves and may determine to increase the reserves at any time in the future if  based upon the factors set forth  it believes it would be appropriate to do so 
at january   our accrued liabilities in connection with an environmental matter include approximately  of fees payable in connection with pending testing and monitoring activities at the site 
while it is reasonably possible that losses exceeding the amounts already accrued may be incurred  because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and the remediation activities  we have concluded that we are unable to reasonably estimate a range of potential expenses  if any  of future site clean up costs that may be directed by the regulatory agency following the current site assessments and surveys 
however  any such potential expenses are not expected to be material to our financial statements  as a whole 
see note commitments and contingencies 
stock based compensation we measure compensation cost for all share based payments including stock options at fair value using a valuation model  which considers  among other things  estimates and assumptions on the rate of forfeiture  expected life of options and stock price volatility 
if any of the assumptions used in the valuation model change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period and actual results may differ from estimates 
impairment of goodwill  other intangibles and long lived assets we test goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
the value of our intangible assets  including goodwill  could be impacted by future adverse changes such as i any future declines in our operating results  ii a decline in the valuation of technology company stocks  including the valuation of our common stock  iii a significant slowdown in the worldwide economy and the semiconductor industry or iv any failure to meet the performance projections included in our forecasts of future operating results 
for our annual impairment review  we primarily use a multi period excess earnings approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies to determine the fair value of the assets 
our assumptions incorporate judgments as to the price received to sell a reporting unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
considering the integration of our operations  we have assumed that the highest and best use of a reporting unit follows an in use valuation premise 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation 
the estimates we have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business 
it is possible  however  that the plans and estimates used may be incorrect 
if our actual results  or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analysis  are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets  we could incur impairment charges in a future period 
in fiscal years and  we reorganized our reporting structure in a manner that changed the composition of our reporting units 
as a result of the change in fiscal year  the goodwill associated with xemics sa and sierra monolithics inc acquisitions have been aggregated 
as of january  all of the goodwill reported was associated with the advanced communications and sensing reporting unit 
in fiscal year  the components of the advanced communications and sensing reporting unit were split into two reporting units consisting of the advanced communications and the wireless and sensing reporting units 
as a result of the change  in fiscal year  goodwill was reassigned to the reporting units affected using a relative fair value allocation approach 
subsequent to the reorganization in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the goodwill associated with the advanced communications and sensing 
table of contents reporting unit was reassigned such that of goodwill is allocated to the wireless and sensing reporting unit and of the goodwill is allocated to the advanced communications reporting unit 
the measurement date used to reassign goodwill was november  in connection with the reorganizations in fiscal year and  the company assessed whether an indicator of impairment existed prior to the reorganizations and concluded that no such indicators were present in fiscal year and goodwill was tested for impairment as of november   the date of the company s annual impairment review 
the company concluded that the fair value of this reporting unit exceeded the carrying value and no impairment existed 
our analysis included sensitivity analysis of key assumptions such as a increase in the weighted average cost of capital  a increase in the effective tax rate or a decline in our compound annual growth rate noting the fair value of the goodwill associated with the advanced communications and sensing reporting unit exceeded the carrying value and no impairment existed 
we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment  such as reductions in demand or significant economic slowdowns in the semiconductor industry  are present 
reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying value of an asset is impaired  based on comparisons to undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if this comparison indicates that there is impairment  the impaired asset is written down to fair value  which is typically calculated using i quoted market prices and or ii discounted expected future cash flows utilizing a discount rate 
impairment is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
generally  to the extent we change a valuation allowance  the change is recorded through the tax provision in the statement of operations 
management periodically evaluates our deferred tax assets to assess whether it is likely that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is required  we consider projected taxable income 
the most significant assumptions used in preparing projections of taxable income include forecasting the levels of income by region and the amount of deductible stock based compensation 
we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant management estimates are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax impact is uncertain 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period of change 
although we believe the estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals 
should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit or litigation  a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result 
the income tax effects of share based payments are recognized for financial reporting purposes only if such awards are expected to result in a tax deduction 
we do not recognize a deferred tax asset for an excess tax benefit that is  a tax benefit that exceeds the amount of compensation cost recognized for the award for financial reporting purposes that has not been realized 
in determining when an excess tax benefit is realized  we have elected to follow the ordering provision of the tax law 
in addition to the risks to the effective tax rate discussed above  the effective tax rate reflected in forward looking statements is based on current enacted tax law 
significant changes in enacted tax law could materially affect these estimates 
in general  the amount of taxes we pay will differ from our reported tax provision as a result of differences between accounting for income under us gaap and accounting for taxable income 
typical book tax differences include expense related to equity compensation  deemed dividends  depreciation  litigation expense and amortization of intangible assets 
as a result of these book tax differences  our tax payments are expected to exceed our tax provision during the next three years 
for intra entity differences between the tax basis of an asset in the buyer s tax jurisdiction and their cost as reported in the consolidated financial statements  we do not recognize a deferred tax asset 
income taxes paid on intra entity profits on assets remaining within the group are accounted for as prepaid taxes 

table of contents in fiscal year  we concluded that million of foreign subsidiary earnings were no longer considered to be permanently reinvested offshore 
in connection with the acquisition of gennum  we reviewed this prior assertion and concluded that only million of foreign subsidiary earnings were no longer permanently reinvested offshore 
this change in assertion will result in recording a discrete adjustment to its tax provision in the first quarter of fiscal year the impact of this change in assertion is expected to result in the recognition of a million tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year new accounting standards in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued updated guidance that simplifies goodwill impairment testing by allowing a qualitative review to assess whether a quantitative impairment analysis is necessary as a first step to the testing 
under this guidance  a company will not be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit that contains recorded goodwill unless it concludes  based on the qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of that reporting unit is less than its book value 
if a decline in fair value is deemed more likely than not to have occurred  then the quantitative goodwill impairment test that is provided under us gaap must be completed  otherwise  goodwill is deemed not to be impaired and no further testing is required until the next annual test date or sooner if conditions or events before that date raise concerns of potential impairment in the reporting unit 
the amended goodwill impairment guidance does not affect the manner in which a company estimates fair value 
the new standard is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
the company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its financial condition  results of operations  cash flows  or disclosures 
in june  the fasb issued a final standard requiring presentation of net income and other comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement or in two  consecutive statements of net income and other comprehensive income 
under both alternatives  an entity is required to present each component of net income and other comprehensive income  their respective totals  and totals for comprehensive income 
this standard eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in shareholders equity 
the amendment is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  the company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its financial condition  results of operations  cash flows  or disclosures 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to a variety of market risks  such as the foreign exchange and interest rate risks that are detailed below 
many of the factors that can impact our market risk are external to the company  and so we are unable to fully predict them 
market conditions current global economic conditions pose a risk to the overall economy as consumers and businesses may defer purchases in response to the uncertainty around tighter credit and negative financial news 
these conditions have historically resulted in periods where demand for our products is reduced 
in addition to risks associated with global economic conditions  demand for our products could be different from our expectations due to customer acceptance of our products  changes in customer order patterns  including order cancellations  and changes in the level of inventory held by vendors 
commodity risk we are subject to risk from fluctuating market prices of certain commodity raw materials  particularly gold  that are incorporated into our end products or used by our suppliers to process our end products 
increased commodity prices are passed on to us in the form of higher prices from our suppliers  either in the form of general price increases or a commodity surcharge 
although we generally deal with our suppliers on a purchase order basis rather than on a long term contract basis  we generally attempt to obtain firm pricing for volumes consistent with planned production 
our gross margins may decline if we are not able to increase selling prices of our products or obtain manufacturing efficiencies to offset the increased cost 
we do not enter into formal hedging arrangements to mitigate against commodity risk 
foreign currency risk as a global enterprise  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and we could experience foreign currency exchange gains or losses 
historically  we have not considered our foreign currency exposure to be material 
therefore  we have not utilized foreign currency hedging products to mitigate foreign currency risks 
our foreign currency exposures may increase over time as the level of activity in foreign markets grows 
changes in the rates could have an adverse impact upon our financial results 
a relatively small amount of our monetary assets and liabilities are denominated in foreign currencies  principally the swiss franc  mexican peso  british pound sterling and the euro 
fluctuations in these currencies relative to the united states dollar will result in transaction gains or losses included in net earnings 
all of our foreign sales  which amounted to million in fiscal year  are denominated in united states dollars 
currency exchange rate fluctuations in foreign countries where we do business could harm our business by resulting in pricing that is not competitive with prices denominated in local currencies 
for fiscal year  we spent approximately million in british pound sterling  million in swiss francs  million in euros and million in mexican pesos for operating expenses 
in general  we purchase foreign currencies on a spot basis as needed to fund local operations 
as of january   we held cash funds of million denominated in british pound sterling  million denominated in swiss francs  million denominated in euros and 
million denominated in mexican pesos 
we did not hold a significant amount of other foreign currencies 
if rates of these foreign currencies were to strengthen or weaken relative to the us dollar  we would realize gains or losses in converting these funds back into us dollars 
interest rate and market risk as of january   we had no long term debt outstanding 
on march   we entered into a credit agreement with the lenders and jefferies finance llc  as administrative agent 
pursuant to the credit agreement  the lenders provided us with senior secured first lien credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of million  consisting of term a loans in an aggregate principal amount of million and term b loans in an aggregate principal amount of million 
the facilities mature on march  a portion of the proceeds of the facilities were used to finance the acquisition of gennum 
interest on the term a loan accrues  at our option  at a rate per annum equal to the base rate as defined below plus a margin ranging from to depending upon our consolidated leverage ratio or libor for an interest period to be selected by us plus a margin ranging from to depending upon our consolidated leverage ratio 
interest on the term b loan accrues  at our option  at a rate per annum equal to the base rate subject to a floor of plus a margin of or libor for an interest period to be selected by us subject to a floor of plus a margin of 
the base rate is equal to a fluctuating rate equal to the highest of a the prime rate  b of above the federal funds effective rate and c one month libor plus subject to certain customary exceptions  all obligations under the facilities are unconditionally guaranteed by each of our existing and subsequently acquired or organized direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries the guarantors 
the obligations and the guarantors in respect of the facilities are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of semtech and the guarantors  subject to certain customary exceptions 
interest rates affect our return on excess cash and investments 
as of january   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million of temporary and long term investments 
a majority of our cash and cash equivalents and investments generate interest income based on prevailing interest rates 
investments and cash and cash equivalents generated interest income of million in fiscal year a significant change in interest rates would impact the amount of interest income generated from our cash and investments 
it would also impact the market value of our investments 
our investments are subject to market risks  primarily interest rate and credit risk 
our investments are managed by a limited number of outside professional managers following investment guidelines set by us 
such guidelines prescribe credit quality  permissible investments  diversification  and duration restrictions 
these restrictions are intended to limit risk by restricting our investments to high quality debt instruments with relatively short term durations 
our investment strategy limits investment of new funds and maturing securities to us treasury  federal agency securities  high quality money market funds and time deposits with our principal commercial banks
