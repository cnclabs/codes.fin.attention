table of contents part i item business overview commercial vehicle group  inc a delaware corporation formed in august and its subsidiaries  is a leading supplier of a full range of cab related products and systems for the global commercial vehicle market  including the heavy duty class truck market  the construction  military  bus and agriculture markets and the specialty transportation markets 
our products include static and suspension seat systems  electronic wire harness assemblies  controls and switches  cab structures and components  interior trim systems including instrument panels  door panels  headliners  cabinetry and floor systems  mirrors and wiper systems specifically designed for applications in commercial vehicles 
we are differentiated from suppliers to the automotive industry by our ability to manufacture low volume  customized products on a sequenced basis to meet the requirements of our customers 
we believe that we have the number one or two position in several of our major markets and that we are one of the only suppliers in the north american commercial vehicle market that can offer complete cab systems  including cab body assemblies  sleeper boxes  seats  interior trim  flooring  wire harnesses  panel assemblies and other structural components 
we believe our products are used by a majority of the north american heavy truck and certain leading global construction original equipment manufacturers oem  which we believe creates an opportunity to cross sell our products and offer a full range of cab related products and systems 
demand for our heavy truck products is generally dependent on the number of new heavy truck commercial vehicles manufactured in north america  which in turn is a function of general economic conditions  interest rates  changes in governmental regulations  consumer spending  fuel costs and our customers inventory levels and production rates 
new heavy truck commercial vehicle demand has historically been cyclical and is particularly sensitive to the industrial sector of the economy  which generates a significant portion of the freight tonnage hauled by commercial vehicles 
production of heavy truck commercial vehicles in north america was strong from to due to the broad economic recovery in north america  corresponding growth in the movement of goods  the growing need to replace aging truck fleets and oems receiving larger than expected preorders in anticipation of the new epa emissions standards becoming effective in during  the demand for north american class heavy trucks experienced a downturn as a result of preorders in and general weakness in the north american economy and corresponding decline in the need for commercial vehicles to haul freight tonnage in north america 
the demand for new heavy truck commercial vehicles in was similar to levels as weakness in the overall north american economy continued to impact production related orders 
the overall weakness in the north american economy and credit markets continued to put pressure on the demand for new vehicles in as reflected in the decline of north american class production levels from we believe this general weakness has contributed to the reluctance of trucking companies to invest in new truck fleets 
in  north american class production levels increased approximately over the prior year period  indicating a recovery in the heavy truck market 
this recovery continued into as north american class production levels increased approximately from according to a february report by act research  a publisher of industry market research  north american class production levels are expected to increase from  in  peak at  in and decline to  in we believe the increase in demand for new class vehicles will be driven by several factors  including growth in freight volumes and the replacement of aging vehicles 
act forecasts that the total us freight composite will increase from trillion in to trillion in act estimates that the average age of active us class trucks is years in  the highest average vehicle age over the past years 
as vehicles age  their maintenance costs typically increase 
act forecasts that the vehicle age will decline as aging fleets are replaced 

table of contents new commercial vehicle demand in the global construction equipment market generally follows certain economic conditions around the world 
within the construction market  there are two classes of construction equipment  the medium heavy equipment market weighing over metric tons and the light construction equipment market weighing below metric tons 
demand in the medium heavy construction equipment market is typically related to the level of larger scale infrastructure development projects such as highways  dams  harbors  hospitals  airports and industrial development  as well as activity in the mining  forestry and other raw material based industries 
demand in the light construction equipment market is typically related to certain economic conditions such as the level of housing construction and other smaller scale developments and projects 
our products are primarily used in the medium heavy construction equipment markets 
demand in the construction equipment market in declined significantly from as a result of the continuing economic downturn in the housing and financial markets 
during and continuing in  the global construction market showed signs of recovery 
industry within the commercial vehicle industry  we sell our products primarily to the global oem truck market approximately of our revenues  the global construction oem market approximately of our revenues  the military market approximately of our revenues and the aftermarket and oem service organizations approximately of our revenues 
the majority of the remaining of our revenues was derived from other global commercial vehicle and specialty markets 
commercial vehicle supply market overview commercial vehicles are used in a wide variety of end markets  including local and long haul commercial trucking  bus  construction  mining  agricultural  military  general industrial  marine  municipal  recreation and specialty vehicle markets 
the commercial vehicle supply industry can generally be separated into two categories sales to oems  in which products are sold in relatively large quantities directly for use by oems in new commercial vehicles  and aftermarket sales  in which products are sold as replacements in varying quantities to a wide range of oem service organizations  wholesalers  retailers and installers 
in the oem market  suppliers are generally divided into tiers tier suppliers like our company  who provide their products directly to oems  and tier or tier suppliers  who sell their products principally to other suppliers for integration into those suppliers own product offerings 
our largest end market  the commercial truck industry  is supplied by heavy and medium duty commercial vehicle suppliers  as well as automotive suppliers 
the commercial vehicle supplier industry is fragmented and comprised of several large companies and many smaller companies 
in addition  the commercial vehicle supplier industry is characterized by relatively low production volumes and can have considerable barriers to entry  including the following significant investment requirements  stringent technical and manufacturing requirements  high transition costs to shift production to new suppliers  just in time delivery requirements and strong brand name recognition 
foreign competition can be limited in the commercial vehicle market due to many factors  including the need to be responsive to order changes on short notice and high shipping costs 
although oem demand for our products is directly correlated with new vehicle production  suppliers like us can also grow by increasing their product content per vehicle through cross selling and bundling of products  further penetrating business with existing customers  gaining new customers and expanding into new geographic markets and by increasing aftermarket sales 
we believe that companies with a global presence and advanced technology  engineering  manufacturing and support capabilities  such as our company  are well positioned to take advantage of these opportunities 

table of contents north american commercial truck market purchasers of commercial trucks include fleet operators  owner operators and other industrial end users 
commercial vehicles used for local and long haul commercial trucking are generally classified by gross vehicle weight 
class vehicles are trucks with gross vehicle weight in excess of  lbs 
and class through vehicles are trucks with gross vehicle weight from  lbs 
to  lbs 
the following table shows commercial vehicle production levels from through in north america thousands of units class heavy trucks class light and medium duty trucks total source act na commercial vehicle outlook february 
the following describes the major markets within the commercial vehicle market in which we compete class truck market the global class truck manufacturing market is concentrated in three primary regions north america  europe and asia pacific 
the global class truck market is localized in nature due to the following factors the prohibitive costs of shipping components from one region to another  the high degree of customization of class trucks to meet the region specific demands of end users and the ability to meet just in time delivery requirements 
according to act research  four companies represented approximately of north american class truck production in the percentages of class production represented by daimler trucks  paccar  international navistar and volvo mack were approximately   and  respectively  in we supply products to all of these oems 
production of class trucks in north america peaked in and experienced a downturn from to that was due to a weak economy  reduced sales following above normal purchases in advance of new epa emissions standards that became effective in october  an oversupply of new and used vehicle inventory and lower spending on commercial vehicles and equipment 
following a substantial decline from to  class truck unit production increased modestly to approximately  units in from approximately  units in  due primarily to the purchasing of trucks that occurred prior to the october mandate for more stringent engine emissions requirements 
subsequent to the engine emissions requirements  truck production continued to remain at historically low levels through mid due to continuing economic weakness and the reluctance of many trucking companies to invest during this period 
in mid  evidence of renewed growth emerged and truck tonmiles number of miles driven multiplied by number of tons transported began to increase  along with new truck sales 
during the second half of  new truck dealer inventories declined and  consequently  oem truck order backlogs began to increase 
according to act  monthly truck order rates began increasing significantly from december through in  oems received larger than expected preorders in anticipation of the new epa emissions standards becoming effective in during  and  the demand for north american class heavy trucks declined as a result of preorders  a weakness in the north american economy and corresponding decline in the need for commercial vehicles to haul freight tonnage in north america 
in  north american class production levels increased approximately over the prior year period 
we believe that the increase from to was a result of the strengthening in the north american economy and corresponding increase in the need for commercial vehicles to haul freight tonnage in north america 
the strengthening in the north american economy continued into as north american class production levels increased approximately over according to act  unit production for is estimated to increase approximately from levels to approximately  units 

table of contents the following table illustrates north american class truck build for the years to north american class truck build rates in thousands logo e estimated source act commercial vehicle outlook february 
we believe the following factors are currently driving the north american class truck market economic conditions 
the north american truck industry is directly influenced by overall economic growth  consumer spending and the ability of our customers to access capital 
since truck oems supply the fleet lines of north america  their production levels generally match the demand for freight 
the freight carried by these trucks includes consumer goods  machinery  food and beverages  construction equipment and supplies  electronic equipment and a wide variety of other materials 
since most of these items are driven by macroeconomic conditions  the truck industry tends to follow trends of gross domestic product 
generally  given the dependence of north american shippers on trucking as a freight alternative  general economic conditions have been a primary indicator of future truck builds 
truck freight growth 
according to act s us freight composite  freight volumes began to recover in and continued into the act freight composite is a measure created to estimate the amount of freight hauled by weighting different sectors of the economy for their contribution to overall freight 
act forecasts that total us freight composite will increase from trillion in to trillion in  as summarized in the following graph total us freight composite in billions logo e estimated source act na commercial vehicle outlook february 

table of contents truck replacement cycle and fleet aging 
the average age of active class trucks has increased from approximately years in to approximately years in the average fleet age tends to run in cycles as freight companies permit their truck fleets to age during periods of lagging demand and then replenish those fleets during periods of increasing demand 
additionally  as truck fleets age  their maintenance costs typically increase 
freight companies must therefore continually evaluate the economics between repair and replacement 
other factors  such as inventory management and the growth in less than truckload freight shipping  also tend to increase fleet mileage and  as a result  the truck replacement cycle 
the chart below illustrates the average age of active us class trucks average age of active us class trucks in years logo e estimated source act na commercial vehicle outlook february 
commercial truck aftermarket demand for aftermarket products is driven by the quality of oem parts  the number of vehicles in operation  the average age of the vehicle fleet  vehicle usage and the average useful life of vehicle parts 
aftermarket sales tend to be at a higher margin  as truck component suppliers are able to leverage their already established fixed cost base and exert moderate pricing power with their replacement parts 
the recurring nature of aftermarket revenue provides some insulation to the overall cyclical nature of the industry  as it tends to provide a more stable stream of revenues 
commercial construction vehicle market new commercial vehicle demand in the global construction equipment market generally follows certain economic conditions around the world 
within the construction market  there are two classes of construction equipment the medium heavy construction equipment market weighing over metric tons and the light construction equipment market weighing below metric tons

due to their high cost  full body e coat systems  such as ours  are rarely found outside of the manufacturing operations of the major oems 
we also have large press lines which provide us with the in house manufacturing flexibility for both aluminum and steel stampings delivered just in time to our cab assembly plants 

table of contents mirrors  wipers and controls 
we manufacture our mirrors  wipers and controls utilizing a variety of manufacturing processes and techniques 
our mirrors  wipers and controls are primarily hand assembled  tested and packaged 
we have a broad array of processes to offer our commercial vehicle oem customers to enable us to meet their styling and cost requirements 
we believe the vehicle cab is the most significant and appealing aspect to the operator of the vehicle  and consequently each commercial vehicle oem has unique requirements as to feel  appearance and features 
the end markets for our products are highly specialized and our customers frequently request modified products in low volumes within an expedited delivery timeframe 
as a result  we primarily utilize flexible manufacturing cells at the vast majority of our production facilities 
manufacturing cells are clusters of individual manufacturing operations and work stations grouped in a circular configuration  with the operators placed centrally within the configuration 
this provides flexibility by allowing efficient changes to the number of operations each operator performs 
when compared to the more traditional  less flexible assembly line process  cell manufacturing allows us to maintain our product output consistent with our oem customers requirements and reduce the level of inventory 
when an end user buys a commercial vehicle  the end user will specify the seat and other features for that vehicle 
because each of our seating systems is unique  our manufacturing facilities have significant complexity which we manage by building in sequence 
we build our seating systems as orders are received  and systems are delivered to the customer s rack in the sequence in which vehicles come down the assembly line 
we have systems in place that allow us to provide complete customized interior kits in boxes that are delivered in sequence 
in many instances  we keep track of our build sequence by product identification numbers and components are identified by bar code 
sequencing reduces our cost of production because it eliminates warehousing costs and reduces waste and obsolescence  offsetting any increased labor costs 
several of our manufacturing facilities are strategically located near our customers assembly plants  which facilitates this process and minimizes shipping costs 
we employ just in time manufacturing and system sourcing in our operations to meet customer requirements for faster deliveries and to minimize our need to carry significant inventory levels 
we utilize material systems to manage inventory levels and  in certain locations  we have inventory delivered as often as two times per day from a nearby facility based on the previous day s order 
this eliminates the need to carry excess inventory at our facilities 
within our cyclical industry  we strive to manage down cycles by running our facilities at capacity while maintaining the capability and flexibility to expand 
we have plans to work with our employees and rely on their involvement to help minimize problems and re align our capacity during fluctuating periods of increased or decreased production levels to achieve on time delivery 
as a means to continuously enhance our operations  we utilize the tqps philosophy throughout our operations 
tqps is our customized version of lean manufacturing and consists of a hour interactive class that is taught by members of our management team 
tqps is an analytical process in which we analyze each of our manufacturing cells and identify the most efficient process to improve efficiency and quality 
the goal is to achieve total cost management and continuous improvement 
some examples of tqps related improvements are reduced labor to move parts around the facility  clear walking paths in and around manufacturing cells and increased safety 
an ongoing goal is to reduce the time employees spend waiting for materials within a facility 
in an effort to increase operational efficiency  improve product quality and provide additional capacity  we intend to continue to implement tqps improvements at each of our manufacturing facilities 

table of contents raw materials and suppliers a description of the principal raw materials we utilize for each of our principal product categories is set forth below seats and seating systems 
the principal raw materials used in our seat systems include steel  aluminum and foam related products and are generally readily available and obtained from multiple suppliers under various supply agreements 
leather  vinyl  fabric and certain components are also purchased from multiple suppliers under supply agreements 
typically  our supply agreements are for a term of at least one year and are terminable by us for breach or convenience 
electronic wire harnesses and panel assemblies 
the principal raw materials used to manufacture our electronic wire harnesses are wire and cable  connectors  terminals  switches  relays and various covering techniques involving braided yarn  braided copper  slit and non slit conduit and foam molded via the reaction injection molding process 
these raw materials are obtained from multiple suppliers and are generally readily available 
trim systems and components 
the principal raw materials used in our interior systems processes are resin and chemical products  foam  vinyl and fabric which are formed and assembled into end products 
these raw materials are obtained from multiple suppliers  typically under supply agreements which are for a term of typically one year or more and terminable by us for breach or convenience 
cab structures  sleeper boxes  body panels and structural components 
the principal raw materials used in our cab structures  sleeper boxes  body panels and structural components are steel and aluminum  the majority of which we purchase in sheets and stamp at our shadyside  ohio facility 
these raw materials are generally readily available and obtained from several suppliers  typically under purchase contracts which fix price and supply for up to one year 
mirrors  wipers and controls 
the principal raw materials used to manufacture our mirrors  wipers and controls are steel  stainless steel and rubber  which are generally readily available and obtained from multiple suppliers 
we also purchase sub assembled products such as motors for our wiper systems and mirrors 
our supply agreements generally provide for fixed pricing but do not require us to purchase any specified quantities 
we have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials and normally do not carry inventories of raw materials or finished products in excess of those reasonably required to meet production and shipping schedules  as well as service requirements 
steel  aluminum  petroleum based products  copper  resin  foam  fabrics  wire and wire components comprise the most significant portion of our raw material costs 
we typically purchase steel  copper and petroleum based products at market prices that are fixed over varying periods of time less than a year 
due to the volatility in pricing over the last several years  we are using tools such as market index pricing and competitive bidding to assist in reducing our overall cost 
we continue to closely align our customer pricing and material costs to minimize the impact of steel  copper and petrochemical price fluctuations 
certain component purchases and suppliers are directed by our customers  so we generally will pass through directly to the customer any cost changes from these components 
we do not believe we are dependent on a single supplier or limited group of suppliers for our raw materials 
customers and marketing we sell our products principally to the commercial vehicle oem truck and construction markets 
approximately and of our revenues and approximately and of our revenues were derived from sales to commercial vehicle truck and construction oems  respectively  with the remainder of our revenues being generated principally from sales to the military and aftermarket and oem service markets 

table of contents the following is a summary of our significant revenues by end market based on final destination customers and markets for each of the three years ended december heavy truck oem construction aftermarket and oem service military bus agriculture other total our principal customers include paccar  volvo mack  daimler trucks  caterpillar  international navistar  deere co  oshkosh corporation  komatsu and skoda 
we believe we are an important long term supplier to all of our customers because of our comprehensive product offerings  leading brand names and product innovation 
the following is a summary of our significant revenues based on customers for the three years ended december paccar volvo mack daimler trucks caterpillar international navistar deere co 
oshkosh corporation komatsu skoda other total except as set forth in the above table  no other customer accounted for more than of our revenues for the three years ended december  our european  asian  australian and mexican operations collectively contributed approximately   and of our revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the change in revenue by geographic location in is primarily related to the impact of the economic conditions in these regions of the world and its related impact on end market demand 
our oem customers generally source business to us pursuant to written contracts  purchase orders or other firm commitments in terms of price  quality  technology and delivery 
awarded business generally covers the supply of all or a portion of a customer s production and service requirements for a particular product program rather than the supply of a specific quantity of products 
in general  these contracts  purchase orders and commitments provide that the customer can terminate the contract  purchase order or commitment if we do not meet specified quality  delivery and cost requirements 
such contracts  purchase orders or other firm commitments generally extend for the entire life of a platform  which is typically five to seven years 
although these contracts  purchase orders or other commitments may be terminated at any time by our customers but not 
table of contents by us  such terminations have been minimal and have not had a material impact on our results of operations 
in order to reduce our reliance on any one vehicle model  we produce products for a broad cross section of both new and more established models 
our contracts with our major oem customers generally provide for an annual productivity cost reduction 
these productivity cost reductions are generally calculated on an annual basis as a percentage of the previous year s purchases by each customer 
the reduction is achieved through engineering changes  material cost reductions  logistics savings  reductions in packaging cost and labor efficiencies 
historically  most of these cost reductions have been offset by both internal reductions and through the assistance of our supply base  although no assurances can be given that we will be able to achieve such reductions in the future 
if the annual productivity cost reduction targets are not achieved  the difference is recovered through price reductions 
our cost structure consists of a high percentage of variable costs that provides us with additional flexibility during economic cycles 
our sales and marketing efforts with respect to our oem sales are designed to create overall awareness of our engineering  design and manufacturing capabilities and to enable us to be selected to supply products for new and redesigned models by our oem customers 
our sales and marketing staff works closely with our design and engineering personnel to prepare the materials used for bidding on new business  as well as to provide a consistent interface between us and our key customers 
we currently have sales and marketing personnel located in every major region in which we operate 
from time to time  we also participate in industry trade shows and advertise in industry publications 
one of our ongoing initiatives is to negotiate and enter into long term supply agreements with our existing customers that allow us to leverage all of our products to our commercial vehicle oem customers 
our principal customers for our aftermarket sales include oem dealers and independent wholesale distributors 
our sales and marketing efforts for our aftermarket sales are focused on support of these two distribution chains  as well as direct contact with major fleets 
backlog we do not generally obtain long term  firm purchase orders from our customers 
rather  our customers typically place annual blanket purchase orders  but these orders do not obligate them to purchase any specific or minimum amount of products from us until a release is issued by the customer under the blanket purchase order 
releases are typically placed within to days of required delivery and may be canceled at any time  in which case the customer would be liable for work in process and finished goods 
we do not believe that our backlog of expected product sales covered by firm purchase orders is a meaningful indicator of future sales since orders may be rescheduled or canceled 
competition within each of our principal product categories  we compete with a variety of independent suppliers and with oems in house operations  primarily on the basis of price  breadth of product offerings  product quality  technical expertise  development capability  product delivery and product service 
we believe we are one of the only suppliers in the north american commercial vehicle market that can offer complete cab system products  including interior systems seats  interior trim and flooring systems  mirrors and wire harnesses with the cab structure 
a summary of our estimated market position and primary independent competitors is set forth below seats and seating systems 
we believe that we have the number one market position in north america supplying seats and seating systems to the commercial vehicle heavy truck market 
we also believe that we have the number one market position in supplying seats and seating systems to commercial vehicles used in the medium heavy construction equipment industry on a worldwide basis 
our primary independent competitors in the north american commercial vehicle market include sears manufacturing company  grammer ag and seats  inc  and our primary competitors in the european and asian commercial vehicle market include grammer ag  isringhausen and tiancheng 

table of contents electronic wire harnesses and panel assemblies 
we believe that we are a leading supplier of low to medium volume complex  electronic wire harnesses and related assemblies used in the global heavy equipment  commercial vehicle  heavy truck and specialty and military vehicle markets 
our principal competitors for electronic wire harnesses include large diversified suppliers such as delphi  forschner  leoni  nexans  pkc  stoneridge  sumitomo and yazaki and smaller independent companies such as fargo assembly  st 
clair technologies and unlimited services 
trim systems and components 
we believe that we have the number one market position in the north american commercial vehicle heavy truck market with respect to our soft interior trim products and a leading presence in the hard interior trim market 
we face competition from a number of different competitors with respect to each of our trim system products and components 
overall  our primary independent competitors are conmet  inteva  wilbur  superior  trim masters inc  blachford ltd 
and magna 
cab structures  sleeper boxes  body panels and structural components 
we believe we are a leading non captive supplier in the north american commercial vehicle heavy truck market with respect to our cab structural components  cab structures  sleeper boxes and body panels 
our principal competitors are magna  crenlo  spartanburg stamping and defiance metal products 
mirrors  wipers and controls 
we believe that we are a leading supplier in the north american commercial vehicle heavy truck market with respect to our windshield wiper systems and mirrors 
we face competition from a number of different competitors with respect to each of our principal products in this category 
our principal competitors for mirrors are hadley  lang mekra and trucklite  and our principal competitors for windshield wiper systems are doga  wexco  trico and valeo 
research and development we believe our state of the art research and development center enables us to offer superior quality and technologically advanced products to our customers at competitive prices 
from invention and discovery to concept  prototyping and production solutions  we offer industrial engineering  product design  cae fea simulation and testing and evaluation services that are necessary in today s demanding markets 
with state of the art laboratories for virtual driving  acoustics  thermal efficiency  benchmarking  multi axis durability  biomechanics  comfort  prototyping and process prove out  we design complete integrated solutions for the end user heavy and medium duty trucks  construction and agriculture vehicles and niche vehicles supporting the fleet manager and the oem 
we engage in global engineering and research and development activities that improve the reliability  performance and cost effectiveness of our existing products and support the design and development of new products for existing and new applications 
we work with our customers engineering and development teams at the beginning of the concept design process for new components and assemblies  or the redesign process for existing components and assemblies  in order to leverage production efficiency and quality 
these processes may take place from one to three years prior to the commencement of production 
due to the compressive nature of our business  development time is critical 
a new component takes between and months during the design phase  while the re engineering of an existing part may take between one and six months 
early design involvement can result in a product that meets or exceeds the customer s design and performance requirements and is more efficient to manufacture 
in addition  our extensive involvement enhances our position for bidding on such business 
we work aggressively to ensure that our quality and delivery metrics distinguish us from our competitors 
we focus on bringing our customers integrated products that have superior content  comfort and safety 
consistent with our value added engineering focus  we place a large emphasis on the relationships with the engineering departments of our customers 
these relationships not only help us to identify new business 
table of contents opportunities but also enable us to compete based on the quality of our products and services  rather than exclusively on price 
we are currently involved in the design stage of several products for our customers and expect to begin production of these products in the years to intellectual property our principal intellectual property consists of product and process technology  a limited number of us and foreign patents  trade secrets  trademarks and copyrights 
although our intellectual property is important to our business operations and in the aggregate constitutes a valuable asset  we do not believe that any single patent  trade secret  trademark or copyright  or group of patents  trade secrets  trademarks or copyrights is critical to the success of our business 
our policy is to seek statutory protection for all significant intellectual property embodied in patents  trademarks and copyrights 
our major product brands include cvg  sprague devices  moto mirror  roadwatch  kab seating  national seating  bostrom seating  cieb  stratos seating  trim systems  comfortek  flametek and mayflower vehicle systems 
we believe that our brands are valuable and are increasing in value with the growth of our business  but that our business is not dependent on such brands 
we own us federal trademark registrations for several of our brands 
seasonality oems production requirements can fluctuate as the demand for new vehicles softens during the holiday seasons in north america  europe  asia and australia as oem manufacturers generally close their production facilities at various times during the year 
employees as of december   we had approximately  permanent employees  of whom approximately were salaried and the remainder were hourly 
as of december   approximately of the employees in our north american operations were unionized  and approximately of our employees at our european  asian and australian operations were represented by shop steward committees 
we did not experience any material strikes  lockouts or work stoppages during and consider our relationship with our employees to be satisfactory 
on an as needed basis during peak periods  contract and temporary employees are utilized 
during periods of weak demand  we respond to reduced volumes through flexible scheduling  furloughs and reductions in force as necessary 
environmental matters we are subject to foreign  federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment and occupational health and safety  including laws regulating air emissions  wastewater discharges  and the generation  storage  handling  use and transportation of hazardous materials  the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the soil  ground or air  and the health and safety of our colleagues 
we are also required to obtain permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations 
we cannot assure you that we are  or have been  in complete compliance with such environment and safety laws  regulations and permits 
if we violate or fail to comply with these laws  regulations or permits  we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators 
in some instances  such a fine or sanction could have a material adverse effect on us 
we are also subject to laws imposing liability for the cleanup of contaminated property 
under these laws  we could be held liable for costs and damages relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at third party sites to which we sent waste containing hazardous substances 
the amount of such liability could be material 
several of our facilities are either certified as  or are in the process of being certified as  iso  or the international environmental management standard compliant or are developing similar 
table of contents environmental management systems 
although we have made  and will continue to make  capital expenditures to implement such environmental programs and comply with environmental requirements  we do not expect to make material capital expenditures for environmental controls in the remainder of or in the environmental laws to which we are subject have become more stringent over time  and we could incur material costs or expenses in the future to comply with environmental laws 
certain of our operations generate hazardous substances and wastes 
if a release of such substances or wastes occurs at or from our properties  or at or from any offsite disposal location to which substances or wastes from our current or former operations were taken  or if contamination is discovered at any of our current or former properties  we may be held liable for the costs of cleanup and for any other response by governmental authorities or private parties  together with any associated fines  penalties or damages 
in most jurisdictions  this liability would arise whether or not we had complied with environmental laws governing the handling of hazardous substances or wastes 
government regulations although the products we manufacture and supply to commercial vehicle oems are not subject to significant government regulation  our business is indirectly impacted by the extensive governmental regulation applicable to commercial vehicle oems 
these regulations primarily relate to emissions and noise standards imposed by the environmental protection agency epa  state regulatory agencies  such as the california air resources board carb  and other regulatory agencies around the world 
commercial vehicle oems are also subject to the national traffic and motor vehicle safety act and federal motor vehicle safety standards promulgated by the national highway traffic safety administration 
changes in emission standards and other proposed governmental regulations could impact the demand for commercial vehicles and  as a result  indirectly impact our operations 
for example  new emission standards governing heavy duty class diesel engines that went into effect in the us on october  and january  resulted in significant purchases of new trucks by fleet operators prior to such date and reduced short term demand for such trucks in periods immediately following such date 
new emission standards for truck engines used in class to trucks imposed by the epa and carb became effective in in  the epa and national highway traffic safety administration adopted a program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve the fuel efficiency of medium and heavy duty vehicles 
these standards will phase in with increasing stringency in each model year from to any changes in epa or carb regulations can have an impact on production volumes for new vehicles and  as a result  indirectly impact our operations 
to the extent that current or future governmental regulation has a negative impact on the demand for commercial vehicles  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected

risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
if any of these certain risks and uncertainties were to actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 
the agreement governing our revolving credit facility contains financial covenants  and that agreement and the indenture governing our senior secured notes due the notes contain other covenants that may restrict our current and future operations  particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to take certain actions 
if we are unable to comply with these covenants  our business  results of operations and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected 
we entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement on april   which amended and restated the loan agreement  dated january  as amended  the loan and security agreement  which governs our revolving credit facility as amended  the revolving credit facility 
under the revolving credit facility  we are required  under certain circumstances  to comply with a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant  as described in more detail under management s discussion and analysis liquidity and capital resources debt and credit facilities revolving credit facility 
we continue to operate in a challenging economic environment  and our ability to comply with the covenants in the loan and security agreement may be affected in the future by economic or business conditions beyond our control 
if we do not comply with the financial and other covenants in the loan and security agreement and we are unable to obtain necessary waivers or amendments from the lender  we would be precluded from borrowing under the loan and security agreement  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and liquidity 
if we are unable to borrow under the loan and security agreement  we will need to meet our capital requirements using other sources and alternative sources of liquidity may not be available on acceptable terms 
in addition  if we do not comply with the financial and other covenants in the loan and security agreement  the lender could declare an event of default under the loan and security agreement  and our indebtedness thereunder could be declared immediately due and payable  which would also result in an event of default under the notes 
the lender under the loan and security agreement would also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments it has to provide further borrowings 
any of these events would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and liquidity 

table of contents in addition  the loan and security agreement contains covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability to incur liens  incur or assume additional debt or guarantees or issue preferred stock  pay dividends  or make redemptions and repurchases  with respect to capital stock  prepay  or make redemptions and repurchases of  subordinated debt  make loans and investments  make capital expenditures  engage in mergers  acquisitions  asset sales  sale leaseback transactions and transactions with affiliates  place restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to the issuer  change the business conducted by us or our subsidiaries  and amend the terms of subordinated debt 
the indenture governing the notes also contain restrictive covenants 
the operating and financial restrictions and covenants in this debt agreement and any future financing agreements may adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities 
our substantial amount of indebtedness may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business  remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on our indebtedness 
the aggregate amount of our outstanding indebtedness was million as of december  our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay  when due  the principal of  interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness 
our indebtedness  combined with our lease and other financial obligations and contractual commitments could have other important consequences to our stockholders 
for example  it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness  including the revolving credit facility and the notes  and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments  including financial and other restrictive covenants  could result in an event of default under the revolving credit facility and the indenture governing the notes  make us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic  industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  and limit our ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt service requirements  execution of our business strategy or other purposes 
any of the above listed factors could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents the agreement governing the revolving credit facility and the indenture governing the notes contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long term best interests 
our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which  if not cured or waived  could result in the acceleration of all our debt 
our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control  and any failure to meet our debt service obligations could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to refinance or restructure our indebtedness before it becomes due 
our ability to pay interest on and principal of the revolving credit facility  the notes and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend principally upon our future operating performance 
as a result  prevailing economic conditions and financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond our control  will affect our ability to make these payments 
our revolving credit facility is due in  and the notes are due in we may not be able to refinance or restructure our revolving credit facility or our long term debt before it becomes due 
if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy our debt service obligations  including payments on the revolving credit facility and the notes  we may have to undertake alternative financing plans  such as refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness  selling assets  reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital 
our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time 
any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants  which could further restrict our business operations 
the terms of the loan and security agreement and the indenture governing the notes  or any agreements governing any future debt instruments  restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives 
in addition  any failure to make scheduled payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating  which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable terms 
our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations  or to refinance our obligations at all or on commercially reasonable terms  would have an adverse effect  which could be material  on our business  financial condition and results of operations  as well as on our ability to satisfy our obligations in respect of our long term debt 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law could discourage potential acquisition proposals  could delay  deter or prevent a change in control and could limit the price certain investors might be willing to pay for our stock 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by laws may inhibit changes in control of our company not approved by our board of directors 
these provisions include a classified board of directors with staggered terms  a prohibition on stockholder action through written consents  a requirement that special meetings of stockholders be called only by the board of directors  advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations  limitations on the ability of stockholders to amend  alter or repeal the by laws  and the authority of the board of directors to issue  without stockholder approval  preferred stock with such terms as the board of directors may determine and additional shares of our common stock 
we are also afforded the protections of section of the delaware general corporation law  which would prevent us from engaging in a business combination with a person who becomes a or greater stockholder for a period of three years from the date such person acquired such status unless certain board or stockholder approvals were obtained 
these provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
volatility and cyclicality in the commercial vehicle market could adversely affect us 

table of contents our profitability depends in part on the varying conditions in the commercial vehicle market 
this market is subject to considerable volatility as it moves in response to cycles in the overall business environment and is particularly sensitive to the industrial sector of the economy  which generates a significant portion of the freight tonnage hauled 
sales of commercial vehicles have historically been cyclical  with demand affected by such economic factors as industrial production  construction levels  demand for consumer durable goods  interest rates and fuel costs 
for example  north american commercial vehicle sales and production experienced a downturn from to due to a confluence of events that included a weak economy  an oversupply of new and used vehicle inventory and lower spending on commercial vehicles and equipment 
in addition  north american commercial vehicle sales and production experienced a downturn during and as a result of preorders in in anticipation of the new epa emission standards becoming effective in and general weakness in the north american economy and corresponding decline in the need for heavy truck commercial vehicles to haul freight tonnage in north america  among other factors 
these downturns had a material adverse effect on our business during the same periods 
north american class production levels in were down approximately over as the overall weakness in the north american economy and credit markets continued to put pressure on the demand for new vehicles 
in addition  tightening of credit in financial markets may continue to adversely affect the ability of our customers to obtain financing for significant truck orders 
although north american class production in increased approximately over the prior year period  we cannot provide any assurance as to the length or level of the recovery from the recent decline  and any further decline would have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 
any extended downturn could again materially affect our business and results of operations 
we also cannot predict that the industry will follow past cyclical patterns that might include strong preorders in advance of new emissions standards or declines driven by post epa standards or economic conditions 
if unit production of class heavy trucks does not continue to recover  it may continue to adversely affect our business and results of operations 
volatility in the commercial vehicle market could result from manmade and natural disasters and other global business disruptions 
volatility in the commercial vehicle market could result from manmade and natural disasters and other global business disruptions 
such catastrophic events may disrupt the commercial vehicle supply chain and materially adversely affect global production levels in our industry 
the impact from disasters that result in wide spread destruction may not be immediately apparent 
it is particularly difficult to assess the impact of catastrophic losses on our suppliers and end customers  who themselves may not fully understand the impact of such events on their businesses 
accordingly  there is no assurance that our results of operations will not be materially affected as a result of the impact of future disasters 
our results of operations could be significantly adversely affected by a continuing  or any future  downturn in the us and global economy 
demand for our heavy truck products is generally dependent on the number of new heavy truck commercial vehicles manufactured in north america 
historically  the demand for heavy truck commercial vehicles has significantly declined during periods of weakness in the north american economy and the corresponding decline in the need for commercial vehicles to haul freight tonnage in north america 
demand for our construction products is also dependent on the overall vehicle demand for new commercial vehicles in the global construction equipment market 
demand in the medium heavy construction equipment market  which is the market in which our products are primarily used  is typically related to the level of larger scale infrastructure development projects 
demand in the light construction equipment market is typically related to certain economic conditions such as the level of housing construction and other smaller scale developments and projects 
downturns in the economy are usually accompanied by related declines in infrastructure development and other construction projects 
accordingly  our results of operations are directly impacted by changes in the us economy and global economic conditions 
the substantial downturn in the us and global economies in significantly lowered demand for our products 
this lower demand reduced our revenues by approximately for the year ended 
table of contents december  compared to the prior year period and reduced our operating income 
in and continuing into  the heavy truck and global construction markets showed signs of recovery 
if the global economy and the financial markets do not continue to recover  we expect that low demand for our products could continue to have a negative impact on our revenues  operating results and financial position 
any prolonged recession could result in lower earnings and reduced cash flow that  over time  could have a material adverse impact on our ability to fund our operations and capital requirements 
current economic conditions and disruptions in the credit and financial markets could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
recently  the financial markets experienced a period of unprecedented turmoil  including the bankruptcy  restructuring or sale of certain financial institutions and the intervention of the us federal government 
while the ultimate outcome of these events cannot be predicted  they may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition if our ability to borrow money to finance our operations were to be impaired 
the crisis in the financial markets may also have a material adverse impact on the availability and cost of credit in the future 
our ability to pay our debt or refinance our obligations under the loan and security agreement and the other agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness including the indenture governing the notes will depend on our future performance  which will be affected by  among other things  prevailing economic conditions 
we believe the tightening of credit in financial markets has also adversely affected the ability of our customers to obtain financing for significant truck orders and the ability of our suppliers to provide us with sufficient raw materials for our products 
if the credit markets do not improve or if there is any future tightening of those markets  our customers ability to finance the purchase of new commercial vehicles or our suppliers ability to provide us with raw materials may be adversely impacted  either of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
our profitability could be adversely affected if the actual production volumes for our customers vehicles are significantly lower than expected 
we incur costs and make capital expenditures based upon estimates of production volumes for our customers vehicles 
while we attempt to establish a price for our components and systems that will compensate for variances in production volumes  if the actual production of these vehicles is significantly less than anticipated  our gross margin on these products would be adversely affected 
we enter into agreements with our customers at the beginning of a given platform s life to supply products for that platform 
once we enter into such agreements  fulfillment of our purchasing requirements is our obligation for the entire production life of the platform  with terms ranging from five to seven years  and we have no provisions to terminate such contracts 
we may become committed to supply products to our customers at selling prices that are not sufficient to cover the direct cost to produce such products 
we cannot predict our customers demands for our products either in the aggregate or for particular reporting periods 
if customers representing a significant amount of our revenues were to purchase materially lower volumes than expected  it would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our major oem customers may exert significant influence over us 
the commercial vehicle component supply industry has traditionally been highly fragmented and serves a limited number of large oems 
as a result  oems have historically had a significant amount of leverage over their outside suppliers 
our contracts with major oem customers generally provide for an annual productivity cost reduction 
historically  cost reductions through product design changes  increased productivity and similar programs with our suppliers have generally offset these customer imposed productivity cost reduction requirements 
however  if we are unable to generate sufficient production cost savings in the future to offset price reductions  our gross margin and profitability would be adversely affected 
in addition  changes in oems purchasing policies or payment practices could have an adverse effect on our business 
we may be unable to successfully implement our business strategy and  as a result  our businesses and financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents our ability to achieve our business and financial objectives is subject to a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
for example  we may not be successful in implementing our strategy if unforeseen factors emerge that diminish the expected growth in the commercial vehicle markets we supply  or we experience increased pressure on our margins 
in addition  we may not succeed in integrating strategic acquisitions  and our pursuit of additional strategic acquisitions may lead to resource constraints  which could have a negative impact on our ability to meet customers demands  thereby adversely affecting our relationships with those customers 
as a result of such business or competitive factors  we may decide to alter or discontinue aspects of our business strategy and may adopt alternative or additional strategies 
any failure to successfully implement our business strategy could adversely affect our business  results of operations and growth potential 
developing product innovations has been and will continue to be a significant part of our business strategy 
we believe that it is important that we continue to meet our customers demands for product innovation  improvement and enhancement  including the continued development of new generation products  design improvements and innovations that improve the quality and efficiency of our products 
however  such development will require us to continue to invest in research and development and sales and marketing 
in the future  we may not have sufficient resources to make such necessary investments  or we may be unable to make the technological advances necessary to carry out product innovations sufficient to meet our customers demands 
we are also subject to the risks generally associated with product development  including lack of market acceptance  delays in product development and failure of products to operate properly 
we may  as a result of these factors  be unable to meaningfully focus on product innovation as a strategy and may therefore be unable to meet our customers demands for product innovation 
if we are unable to obtain raw materials at favorable prices  it could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
numerous raw materials are used in the manufacture of our products 
steel  aluminum  petroleum based products  copper  resin  foam  fabrics  wire and wire components account for the most significant portion of our raw material costs 
although we currently maintain alternative sources for raw materials  our business is subject to the risk of price increases and periodic delays in delivery 
for example  we are currently being assessed surcharges on certain purchases of steel  copper and other raw materials 
if we are unable to purchase certain raw materials required for our operations for a significant period of time  our operations would be disrupted  and our results of operations would be adversely affected 
in addition  if we are unable to pass on the increased costs of raw materials to our customers  this could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we may be unable to complete additional strategic acquisitions or we may encounter unforeseen difficulties in integrating acquisitions 
we may pursue additional acquisition targets that will allow us to continue to expand into new geographic markets  add new customers  provide new product  manufacturing and service capabilities and increase penetration with existing customers 
however  we expect to face competition for acquisition candidates  which may limit the number of our acquisition opportunities and may lead to higher acquisition prices 
moreover  acquisitions of businesses may require additional debt financing  resulting in additional leverage 
the covenants in the loan and security agreement and the indenture governing the notes may further limit our ability to complete acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that we will find attractive acquisition candidates or successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing business 
if we fail to complete additional acquisitions  we may have difficulty competing with more thoroughly integrated competitors and our results of operations could be adversely affected 
to the extent that we do complete additional acquisitions  if the expected synergies from such acquisitions do not materialize or we fail to successfully integrate such new businesses into our existing businesses  our results of operations could also be adversely affected 
we may be adversely impacted by labor strikes  work stoppages and other matters 

table of contents the hourly workforces at our shadyside  ohio facility and mexico operations are unionized 
the unionized employees at these facilities represented approximately of our employees in our north american operations as of december  we have experienced limited unionization efforts at certain of our other north american facilities from time to time 
in addition  approximately of our employees at our european  asian and australian operations were represented by a shop steward committee  which may seek to limit our flexibility in our relationship with these employees 
we cannot assure you that we will not encounter future unionization efforts or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees 
many of our oem customers and their suppliers also have unionized work forces 
work stoppages or slow downs experienced by oems or their other suppliers could result in slow downs or closures of assembly plants where our products are included in assembled commercial vehicles 
in the event that one or more of our customers or their suppliers experience a material work stoppage  such work stoppage could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our businesses are subject to statutory environmental and safety regulations in multiple jurisdictions  and the impact of any changes in regulation and or the violation of any applicable laws and regulations by our businesses could result in a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to foreign  federal  state  and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment and occupational health and safety  including laws regulating air emissions  wastewater discharges  generation  storage  handling  use and transportation of hazardous materials  the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the soil  ground or air  and the health and safety of our colleagues 
we are also required to obtain permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations 
we cannot assure you that we are  or have been  in complete compliance with such environmental and safety laws  regulations and permits 
if we violate or fail to comply with these laws  regulations or permits  we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators 
in some instances  such a fine or sanction could have a material and adverse effect on us 
the environmental laws to which we are subject have become more stringent over time  and we could incur material expenses in the future to comply with environmental laws 
we are also subject to laws imposing liability for the cleanup of contaminated property 
under these laws  we could be held liable for costs and damages relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at third party sites to which we sent waste containing hazardous substances 
the amount of such liability could be material 
several of our facilities are either certified as  or are in the process of being certified as iso   or ts the international environmental management standard compliant or are developing similar environmental management systems 
although we have made  and will continue to make  capital expenditures to implement such environmental programs and comply with environmental requirements  we do not expect to make material capital expenditures for environmental controls in or the environmental laws to which we are subject have become more stringent over time  and we could incur material costs or expenses in the future to comply with environmental laws 
certain of our operations generate hazardous substances and wastes 
if a release of such substances or wastes occurs at or from our properties  or at or from any offsite disposal location to which substances or wastes from our current or former operations were taken  or if contamination is discovered at any of our current or former properties  we may be held liable for the costs of cleanup and for any other response by governmental authorities or private parties  together with any associated fines  penalties or damages 
in most jurisdictions  this liability would arise whether or not we had complied with environmental laws governing the handling of hazardous substances or wastes 
we may be adversely affected by the impact of government regulations on our oem customers 
although the products we manufacture and supply to commercial vehicle oems are not subject to significant government regulation  our business is indirectly impacted by the extensive governmental regulation 
table of contents applicable to commercial vehicle oems 
these regulations primarily relate to emissions and noise standards imposed by the us environmental protection agency epa  state regulatory agencies in north america  such as the california air resources board carb  and other regulatory agencies around the world 
commercial vehicle oems are also subject to the national traffic and motor vehicle safety act and federal motor vehicle safety standards promulgated by the national highway traffic safety administration in the us changes in emission standards and other proposed governmental regulations could impact the demand for commercial vehicles and  as a result  indirectly impact our operations 
for example  new emission standards governing heavy duty class diesel engines that went into effect in the us on october  and january  resulted in significant purchases of new trucks by fleet operators prior to such dates and reduced short term demand for such trucks in periods immediately following such dates 
new emission standards for truck engines used in class to trucks imposed by the epa and carb became effective in in  the epa and national highway traffic safety administration adopted a program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve the fuel efficiency of medium and heavy duty vehicles 
these standards will phase in with increasing stringency in each model year from to to the extent that current or future governmental regulation has a negative impact on the demand for commercial vehicles  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 
our customer base is concentrated and the loss of business from a major customer or the discontinuation of particular commercial vehicle platforms could reduce our revenues 
sales to paccar  volvo mack  daimler trucks  caterpillar  international navistar  deere co 
and oshkosh trucks accounted for approximately      and  respectively  of our revenue in  and our ten largest customers accounted for approximately of our revenue in the loss of any of our largest customers or the loss of significant business from any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
even though we may be selected as the supplier of a product by an oem for a particular vehicle  our oem customers issue blanket purchase orders which generally provide for the supply of that customer s annual requirements for that vehicle  rather than for a specific number of our products 
if the oem s requirements are less than estimated  the number of products we sell to that oem will be accordingly reduced 
in addition  the oem may terminate its purchase orders with us at any time 
currency exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 
we have operations in europe  asia  australia and mexico  which accounted in the aggregate for approximately of our revenues in as a result  we generate a significant portion of our sales and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than the us dollar 
to the extent that we are unable to match revenues received in foreign currencies with costs paid in the same currency  exchange rate fluctuations in any such currency could have an adverse effect on our financial results 
we are subject to certain risks associated with our foreign operations 
we have operations in europe  asia  australia and mexico  which accounted in the aggregate for approximately  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
there are certain risks inherent in our international business activities including  but not limited to the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems  foreign customers  who may have longer payment cycles than customers in the us  tax rates in certain foreign countries  which may exceed those in the us withholding requirements or the imposition of tariffs  exchange controls or other restrictions  including restrictions on repatriation  on foreign earnings  intellectual property protection difficulties  
table of contents general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate  which may have an adverse effect on our operations in those countries  the difficulties associated with managing a large organization spread throughout various countries  and complications in complying with a variety of foreign laws and regulations  which may conflict with us law 
as we continue to expand our business on a global basis  we are increasingly exposed to these risks 
our success will be dependent  in part  on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with foreign operations 
we cannot assure you that these and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our international operations or our business  financial condition or results of operations as a whole 
our inability to compete effectively in the highly competitive commercial vehicle component supply industry could result in lower prices for our products  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  which could have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results 
the commercial vehicle component supply industry is highly competitive 
some of our competitors are companies  or divisions or subsidiaries of companies that are larger and have greater financial and other resources than we do 
in some cases  we compete with divisions of our oem customers 
for example  the closing of our norwalk  ohio truck cab assembly facility in was a result of navistar s decision to insource the cab assembly operations that we performed in that facility into its existing assembly facility in escobedo  mexico 
our products primarily compete on the basis of price  breadth of product offerings  product quality  technical expertise and development capability  product delivery and product service 
increased competition may lead to price reductions resulting in reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
current and future competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with others  foresee the course of market development more accurately than we do  develop products that are superior to our products  produce similar products at lower cost than we can or adapt more quickly to new technologies  industry or customer requirements 
by doing so  they may enhance their ability to meet the needs of our customers or potential future customers 
these developments could limit our ability to obtain revenues from new customers and to maintain existing revenues from our customer base 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and the failure to do so may have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our products may be rendered less attractive by changes in competitive technologies 
changes in competitive technologies may render certain of our products less attractive 
our ability to anticipate changes in technology and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis will be a significant factor in our ability to remain competitive 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve the technological advances that may be necessary for us to remain competitive 
we are also subject to the risks generally associated with new product introductions and applications  including lack of market acceptance  delays in product development and failure of products to operate properly 
if we are unable to recruit or retain skilled personnel  or if we lose the services of any of our key management personnel  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract  train  integrate and retain highly skilled personnel 
competition for these employees is intense 
we may not be able to retain our current key employees or attract  train  integrate or retain other highly skilled personnel in the future 
our future success also depends in large part on the continued service of key management personnel  particularly our key executive officers 
if we lose the services of one or more of these individuals or other key personnel  or if we are unable to attract  train  
table of contents integrate and retain the highly skilled personnel we need  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we have only limited protection for our proprietary rights in our intellectual property  which makes it difficult to prevent third parties from infringing upon our rights 
our success depends to a certain degree on our ability to protect our intellectual property and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties 
while we have been issued patents and have registered trademarks with respect to many of our products  our competitors could independently develop similar or superior products or technologies  duplicate our designs  trademarks  processes or other intellectual property or design around any processes or designs on which we have or may obtain patents or trademark protection 
in addition  it is possible that third parties may have or acquire licenses for other technology or designs that we may use or desire to use  so that we may need to acquire licenses to  or to contest the validity of  such patents or trademarks of third parties 
such licenses may not be made available to us on acceptable terms  if at all  and we may not prevail in contesting the validity of third party rights 
in addition to patent and trademark protection  we also protect trade secrets  know how and other confidential information against unauthorized use by others or disclosure by persons who have access to them  such as our employees  through contractual arrangements 
these arrangements may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets  know how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use  misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets  know how or other proprietary information 
if we are unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies  our revenues could be materially adversely affected 
our products may be susceptible to claims by third parties that our products infringe upon their proprietary rights 
as the number of products in our target markets increases and the functionality of these products further overlaps  we may become increasingly subject to claims by a third party that our technology infringes such party s proprietary rights 
regardless of their merit  any such claims could be time consuming and expensive to defend  may divert management s attention and resources  could cause product shipment delays and could require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements 
if successful  a claim of infringement against us and our inability to license the infringed or similar technology and or product could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
the market price of our common stock may continue to be extremely volatile 
our stock price has fluctuated since our initial public offering in august the trading price of our common stock is subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating results  including foreign currency exchange fluctuations  the gain or loss of significant orders  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  general conditions in the commercial vehicle industry and other events or factors 
in addition  the equity markets in general have recently experienced significant disruptions which have caused substantial volatility in the market price for many companies in industries similar or related to that of ours and which have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these market fluctuations may have affected and may continue to affect the market price of our common stock 
our operating results  revenues and expenses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year  which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
for a number of reasons  including but not limited to  those described below  our operating results  revenues and expenses have in the past varied and may in the future vary significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year 
these fluctuations could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 

table of contents fluctuations in quarterly or annual operating results 
our operating results may fluctuate as a result of the size  timing  volume and execution of significant orders and shipments  changes in the terms of our sales contracts  the timing of new product announcements  changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors  market acceptance of new and enhanced products  the length of our sales cycles  changes in our operating expenses  personnel changes  new business acquisitions  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and seasonal factors 
limited ability to adjust expenses 
we base our operating expense budgets primarily on expected revenue trends 
certain of our expenses are relatively fixed and as such we may be unable to adjust expenses quickly enough to offset any unexpected revenue shortfall 
accordingly  any shortfall in revenue may cause significant variation in operating results in any quarter or year 
based on the above factors  we believe that quarter to quarter or year to year comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance 
it is possible that in one or more future quarters or years  our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in that event  the trading price of our common stock may be adversely affected 
we may be subject to product liability claims  recalls or warranty claims  which could be expensive  damage our reputation and result in a diversion of management resources 
as a supplier of products and systems to commercial vehicle oems  we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that our products  or the equipment into which our products are incorporated  malfunction and result in personal injury or death 
product liability claims could result in significant losses as a result of expenses incurred in defending claims or the award of damages 
in addition  we may be required to participate in recalls involving systems or components sold by us if any prove to be defective  or we may voluntarily initiate a recall or make payments related to such claims as a result of various industry or business practices or the need to maintain good customer relationships 
such a recall would result in a diversion of management resources 
while we do maintain product liability insurance  we cannot assure you that it will be sufficient to cover all product liability claims  that such claims will not exceed our insurance coverage limits or that such insurance will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
any product liability claim brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
moreover  we warrant the workmanship and materials of many of our products under limited warranties and have entered into warranty agreements with certain oems that warranty certain of our products in the hands of these oems customers  in some cases for as long as seven years 
accordingly  we are subject to risk of warranty claims in the event that our products do not conform to our customers specifications or  in some cases in the event that our products do not conform to their customers expectations 
it is possible for warranty claims to result in costly product recalls  significant repair costs and damage to our reputation  all of which would adversely affect our results of operations 

table of contents equipment failures  delays in deliveries or catastrophic loss at any of our facilities could lead to production or service curtailments or shutdowns 
we manufacture or assemble our products at facilities in north america  europe  asia and australia 
an interruption in production or service capabilities at any of these facilities as a result of equipment failure or other reasons could result in our inability to produce our products  which could reduce our net revenues and earnings for the affected period 
in the event of a stoppage in production at any of our facilities  even if only temporary  or if we experience delays as a result of events that are beyond our control  delivery times to our customers could be severely affected 
any significant delay in deliveries to our customers could lead to increased returns or cancellations and cause us to lose future revenues 
our facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires  explosions or violent weather conditions 
we may experience plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of equipment failure  delays in deliveries or catastrophic loss  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
our inability to successfully execute any planned cost reductions  restructuring initiatives or the achievement of operational efficiencies could result in the incurrence of additional costs and expenses that could adversely affect our reported earnings 
as part of our business strategy  we continuously seek ways to lower costs  improve manufacturing efficiencies and increase productivity and intend to apply this strategy to those operations acquired through acquisitions 
we may be unsuccessful in achieving these objectives which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  we may incur restructuring charges in the future and such charges could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
in  we announced the following restructuring plans a reduction in workforce and the closure of certain manufacturing  warehousing and assembly facilities 
the facilities closed included an assembly and sequencing facility in kent  washington  seat sequencing and assembly facility in statesville  north carolina  manufacturing facility in lake oswego  oregon  inventory and product warehouse in concord  north carolina  and seat assembly and distribution facility in seneffs  belgium 
the decision to reduce our workforce was the result of the extended downturn of the global economy and  in particular  the commercial vehicle markets 
we substantially completed these activities as of december  the closure of our vancouver  washington manufacturing facility 
the decision to close the facility was the result of the extended downturn of the global economy and  in particular  the commercial vehicle markets 
we substantially completed this closure as of december  the closure and consolidation of one of our facilities located in liberec  czech republic and the closing of our norwalk  ohio truck cab assembly facility 
the closure and consolidation of our liberec  czech republic facility was a result of management s continued focus on reducing fixed costs and eliminating excess capacity 
the closure of this facility was substantially completed as of december  the closure of our norwalk  ohio facility was a result of navistar s decision to insource the cab assembly operations into its existing assembly facility in escobedo  mexico 
we substantially completed the norwalk closure as of september  we estimate that we will record total cash expenditures for all of these restructuring plans of approximately million  consisting of approximately million of severance costs and million of facility closure costs 
our earnings may be adversely affected by changes to the carrying values of our tangible and intangible assets as a result of recording any impairment charges deemed necessary 
we are required to perform impairment tests whenever events and circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
significant and unanticipated changes in circumstances  such as the general economic environment  changes or downturns in our industry as a whole  termination of any of our customer contracts  restructuring efforts and general workforce reductions  may result in a charge for impairment that can materially and adversely affect our reported net income and our stockholders equity

company overview we are a leading supplier of a full range of cab related products and systems for the global commercial vehicle market  including the heavy duty class truck market  the construction  military  bus and agriculture markets and the specialty transportation markets 
our products include static and suspension seat systems  electronic wire harness assemblies  control and switches  cab structures and components  interior trim systems including instrument panels  door panels  headliners  cabinetry and floor systems  mirrors and wiper systems specifically designed for applications in commercial vehicles 
we are differentiated from suppliers to the automotive industry by our ability to manufacture low volume customized products on a sequenced basis to meet the requirements of our customers 
we believe that we have the number one or two position in several of our major markets and that we are one of the only suppliers in the north american commercial vehicle market that can offer complete cab systems  including cab body assemblies  sleeper boxes  seats  interior trim  flooring  wire harnesses  panel assemblies and other structural components 
we believe our products are used by a majority of the north american heavy truck and certain leading global construction oems  which we believe creates an opportunity to cross sell our products and offer a full range of cab related products and systems 
demand for our heavy truck products is generally dependent on the number of new heavy truck commercial vehicles manufactured in north america  which in turn is a function of general economic conditions  interest rates  changes in governmental regulations  consumer spending  fuel costs and our customers inventory levels and production rates 
new heavy truck commercial vehicle demand has historically been cyclical and is particularly sensitive to the industrial sector of the economy  which generates a significant portion of the freight tonnage hauled by commercial vehicles 
production of heavy truck commercial vehicles in north america was strong from to due to the broad economic recovery in north america  corresponding growth in the movement of goods  the growing need to replace aging truck fleets and oems receiving larger than expected preorders in anticipation of the new epa emissions standards becoming effective in during  the demand for north american class heavy trucks experienced a downturn as a result of preorders in and general weakness in the north american economy and corresponding decline in the need for commercial vehicles to haul freight tonnage in north america 
the demand for new heavy truck commercial vehicles in was similar to levels as weakness in the overall north american economy continued to impact production related orders 
the overall weakness in the north american economy and credit markets continued to put pressure on the demand for new vehicles in as reflected in the decline of north american class production levels from we believe this general weakness has contributed to the reluctance of trucking companies to invest in new truck fleets 
in  north american class production levels increased approximately over the prior year period  indicating a recovery in the heavy truck market 
this recovery continued into as north american class production levels increased approximately from according to a february report by act research  a publisher of industry market research  north american class production levels are expected to increase from  in  peak at  in and decline to  in 
table of contents we believe the increase in demand for new class vehicles will be driven by several factors  including growth in freight volumes and the replacement of aging vehicles 
act forecasts that total us freight composite will increase from trillion in to trillion in act estimates that the average age of active us class trucks is years in  the highest average vehicle age over the past years 
as vehicles age  their maintenance costs typically increase 
act forecasts that the vehicle age will decline as aging fleets are replaced 
in  approximately of our revenue was generated from sales to north american heavy duty truck oems 
our remaining revenue in was primarily derived from sales to oems in the global construction market  european truck market  aftermarket  oem service organizations  military market and other commercial vehicle and specialty markets 
demand for our products is also driven to a significant degree by preferences of the end user of the commercial vehicle  particularly with respect to heavy duty class trucks 
unlike the automotive industry  commercial vehicle oems generally afford the ultimate end user the ability to specify many of the component parts that will be used to manufacture the commercial vehicle  including a wide variety of cab interior styles and colors  the brand and type of seats  type of seat fabric and color and specific mirror styling 
in addition  certain of our products are only utilized in heavy duty class trucks  such as our storage systems  sleeper boxes  sleeper bunks and privacy curtains  and  as a result  changes in demand for heavy duty class trucks or the mix of options on a vehicle can have a greater impact on our business than changes in the overall demand for commercial vehicles 
to the extent that demand for higher content vehicles increases or decreases  our revenues and gross profit will be impacted positively or negatively 
demand for our construction products is dependent on the overall vehicle demand for new commercial vehicles in the global construction equipment market and generally follows certain economic conditions around the world 
our products are primarily used in the medium heavy construction equipment markets weighing over metric tons 
demand in the medium heavy construction equipment market is typically related to the level of larger scale infrastructure development projects such as highways  dams  harbors  hospitals  airports and industrial development  as well as activity in the mining  forestry and other raw material based industries 
during  we experienced a significant decline in global construction equipment production levels as a result of the global economic downturn and related reduction in new equipment orders 
during and continuing in  the global construction market has shown signs of recovery 
along with the us  we have operations in europe  asia  australia and mexico 
our operating results are  therefore  impacted by exchange rate fluctuations to the extent we translate our foreign operations from their local currencies into us dollars 
changes in these foreign currencies as compared to the us dollar resulted in an approximate million increase in our revenues in as compared to and changes to these foreign currencies as compared to the us dollar resulted in an approximate million reduction in our revenues in as compared to because our costs were generally impacted to the same degree as our revenue  this exchange rate fluctuation did not have a material impact on our net income in as compared to and in as compared to we continuously seek ways to improve our operating performance by lowering costs 
these efforts include  but are not limited to  the following adjusting our hourly and salaried workforce to optimize costs in line with our production levels  sourcing efforts in mexico  europe and asia  consolidating our supply base to improve purchasing leverage  eliminating excess production capacity through the closure and consolidation of manufacturing  warehousing or assembly facilities  improving our manufacturing cost basis by locating production in low cost regions of the world  and implementing lean manufacturing and tqps initiatives to improve operating efficiency and product quality 

table of contents in the three months ended december   we announced restructuring plans for the closure and consolidation of one of our facilities located in liberec  czech republic and the closing of our norwalk  ohio truck cab assembly facility 
the closure and consolidation of our liberec  czech republic facility was a result of management s continued focus on reducing fixed costs and eliminating excess capacity 
the closure of this facility was substantially completed as of december  the closure of our norwalk  ohio facility was a result of navistar s decision to source the cab assembly operations into its existing assembly facility in escobedo  mexico 
we substantially completed the norwalk closure by september although oem demand for our products is directly correlated with new vehicle production  we also have the opportunity to grow through increasing our product content per vehicle through cross selling and bundling of products 
we generally compete for new business at the beginning of the development of a new vehicle platform and upon the redesign of existing programs 
new platform development generally begins at least one to three years before the marketing of such models by our customers 
contract durations for commercial vehicle products generally extend for the entire life of the platform  which is typically five to seven years 
in sourcing products for a specific platform  the customer generally develops a proposed production timetable  including current volume and option mix estimates based on their own assumptions  and then sources business with the supplier pursuant to written contracts  purchase orders or other firm commitments in terms of price  quality  technology and delivery 
in general  these contracts  purchase orders and commitments provide that the customer can terminate if a supplier does not meet specified quality and delivery requirements and  in many cases  they provide that the price will decrease over the proposed production timetable 
awarded business generally covers the supply of all or a portion of a customer s production and service requirements for a particular product program rather than the supply of a specific quantity of products 
accordingly  in estimating awarded business over the life of a contract or other commitment  a supplier must make various assumptions as to the estimated number of vehicles expected to be produced  the timing of that production  mix of options on the vehicles produced and pricing of the products being supplied 
the actual production volumes and option mix of vehicles produced by customers depend on a number of factors that are beyond a supplier s control 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
for a comprehensive discussion of our significant accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements in item in this annual report on form k 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis  particularly relating to revenue recognition and sales commitments  inventory reserves  intangible and long lived assets  income taxes  warranty reserves and pension and other post retirement benefit plans 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets  liabilities and equity that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results and outcomes could differ materially from these estimates and assumptions 
see item a risk factors in this annual report on form k for additional information regarding risk factors that may impact our estimates 
revenue recognition and sales commitments we recognize revenue when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  there is a fixed or determinable price and collectability is reasonably assured 
our products are generally shipped from our facilities to our customers  which is when legal title passes to the customer for substantially all of our revenues 
we enter into agreements with our customers at the beginning of a given platform s life to supply products for 
table of contents that platform 
once we enter into such agreements  fulfillment of our purchasing requirements is our obligation for the entire production life of the platform  with terms generally ranging from five to seven years  and we have no provisions to terminate such contracts 
provisions for anticipated contract losses are recognized at the time they become evident 
in certain instances  we may be committed under existing agreements to supply product to our customers at selling prices that are not sufficient to cover the cost to produce such product 
in such situations  we record a provision for the estimated future amount of such losses 
such losses are recognized at the time that the loss is probable and reasonably estimable and are recorded at the minimum amount necessary to fulfill our obligations to our customers 
we had a provision for anticipated contract losses of million as of december  we had a provision of million for such losses as of december and million as of december  inventory reserves inventories are valued at the lower of first in  first out fifo cost or market 
cost includes applicable material  labor and overhead 
we value our finished goods inventory at a standard cost that is periodically adjusted to approximate actual cost 
inventory quantities on hand are regularly reviewed  and where necessary  provisions for excess and obsolete inventory are recorded based primarily on our estimated production requirements driven by expected market volumes 
excess and obsolete provisions may vary by product depending upon future potential use of the product 
intangible and long lived assets we review definite lived intangible and long lived assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
if an indicator exists  a determination is made by management to ascertain whether property and equipment and certain definite lived intangibles are recoverable based on the sum of expected future undiscounted cash flows from operating activities 
determining the fair value of these assets is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
if the estimated undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying amount of such assets  we will recognize an impairment loss in an amount necessary to write down the assets to fair value as determined from expected discounted future cash flows 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable  but that are inherently uncertain 
for further information on our goodwill and intangible asset impairment  see notes and to our consolidated financial statements in item in this annual report on form k 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
in addition  tax expense includes the impact of differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes which results in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
to the extent that recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
as of december   we determined that a valuation allowance of million was needed against our deferred tax assets 
this amount represents our total net deferred assets less deferred assets in certain state and international jurisdictions that do not have a multiple year cumulative loss 
where we have a multiple year cumulative loss  we believe that it is appropriate to establish a valuation allowance 
in the event that our actual results differ from our estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  the effects of these adjustments could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
as of december   our net deferred tax asset position is approximately million in our financials 
the net deferred tax asset as of december  was approximately thousand 
warranty reserves we are subjected to warranty claims for products that fail to perform as expected due to design or manufacturing deficiencies 
customers continue to require their outside suppliers to guarantee or warrant their products and bear the cost of repair or replacement of such products 
depending on the terms under which we supplied products to our customers  a customer may hold us responsible for some or all of the repair or replacement costs of defective products  when the product supplied did not perform as represented 
our policy is 
table of contents to reserve for estimated future customer warranty costs based on historical trends and current economic factors 
the amount of such estimates for warranty liability was approximately million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
pension and other post retirement benefit plans we sponsor pension and other post retirement benefit plans that cover certain hourly and salaried employees in the us and united kingdom 
our policy is to make annual contributions to the plans to fund the normal cost as required by local regulations 
in addition  we have another post retirement benefit plan for certain us operations  retirees and their dependents 
our assumptions the determination of pension and other post retirement benefit plan obligations and related expenses requires the use of assumptions to estimate the amount of the benefits that employees earn while working  as well as the present value of those benefits 
our assumptions are determined based on current market conditions  historical information and consultation with and input from third party actuaries 
due to the significant management judgment involved  our assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension and other post retirement benefit expenses and obligations 
significant assumptions used to measure our annual pension and other post retirement benefit expenses include discount rate  expected return on plan assets  and health care cost trend rates 
discount rate the discount rate represents the interest rate that should be used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle the pension and other post retirement benefit obligations 
in estimating this rate  we consider rates of return on high quality fixed income investments included in various published bond indexes 
we consider the citigroup pension discount curve and the barclay s capital non gilt aa rated sterling bond index in the determination of the appropriate discount rate assumptions 
the weighted average rate we used to measure our pension obligation as of december  was for the us and for the non u 
s pension plans 
expected long term rate of return the expected return on pension plan assets is based on our historical experience  our pension plan investment strategy and our expectations for long term rates of return 
our pension plan investment strategy is reviewed annually and is established based upon plan liabilities  an evaluation of market conditions  tolerance for risk and cash requirements for benefit payments 
we use a third party advisor to assist us in determining our investment allocation and modeling our long term rate of return assumptions 
for and  we assumed an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of for the us pension plans and for the non us pension plans  respectively 
changes in the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets within the range indicated below would have had the following impact on pension and other post retirement benefits results in thousands percentage point increase percentage point decrease decrease increase due to change in assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit costs for the year ended december  discount rate expected long term rate of return on plan assets decrease increase due to change in assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for the year ended december  discount rate 
table of contents health care cost trend rates the health care cost trend rates represent the annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits based on estimates of health care inflation  changes in health care utilization or delivery patterns  technological advances and changes in the health status of the plan participants 
for measurement purposes  a and annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for and  respectively 
the rate was assumed to decrease gradually to through and remain constant thereafter 
assumed health care cost trend rates can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for other post retirement benefit plans

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this change resulted primarily from a increase in north american heavy duty class truck production  fluctuations in production levels for other north american end markets and net new business awards resulting in approximately million of increased revenues  acquisition related revenues of approximately million for bostrom  which we acquired in january  and stratos  which we acquired in july  increase in production levels due to higher demand in our european  australian and asian markets resulting in approximately million of increased revenues  and favorable foreign exchange fluctuations from the translation of our foreign operations into us dollars resulting in an increase of approximately million of revenues 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  gross profit increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this increase resulted primarily from increased revenues from the prior year period as well as our continued focus on operating improvements and leveraging our fixed costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase resulted primarily from increased wages and benefits and increased travel and development costs to support new product initiatives and future programs 
amortization expense 
amortization expense increased to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily the result of the increase of our definite lived intangible assets relating to trademarks tradenames from our acquisitions of bostrom seating and stratos in the year ended december  restructuring costs 
we recorded restructuring charges for the year ended december  of million relating to the closure of certain manufacturing  warehousing and assembly facilities 
we recorded restructuring charges for the year ended december  of million relating to the closure of certain manufacturing  warehousing and assembly facilities 
other income expense 
we use forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency transaction exposures 
we estimate our projected revenues and purchases in certain foreign currencies or locations and will hedge a portion or all of the anticipated long or short position 
all existing forward foreign exchange contracts have been marked to market and the fair value of contracts recorded in the consolidated balance sheets with the offsetting non cash gain or loss recorded in our consolidated statements of operations 
the million of expense for the year ended december  and the million of income for the year ended december  are primarily related to the noncash change in value of the forward exchange contracts in existence at the end of each period 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily the result of higher average outstanding debt obligations resulting from the issuance of our million of notes 

table of contents loss on early extinguishment of debt 
in connection with the issuance of our notes  we expensed approximately million of fees consisting of million write off of deferred financing fees relating to our prior debt and million of prepayment penalties relating to the prepayment of our prior debt 
we did not record an expense relating to the modification of our debt arrangements for the year ended december  provision benefit for income taxes 
our provision for income taxes increased million to a provision of million for the year ended december   compared to an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was 
this rate is lower than the federal statutory rate of primarily due to the mix of income between united states and non us locations  the incremental impact from discrete items during the period  as well as valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets
