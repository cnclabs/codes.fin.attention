item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors 
you should read this section in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item 
critical accounting policies the accompanying consolidated financial statements and supplementary information were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
significant accounting policies are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  item inherent in the application of many of these accounting policies is the need for management to make estimates and judgments in the determination of certain revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
as such  materially different financial results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known 
the policies with the greatest potential effect on our results of operations and financial position include allowance for doubtful accounts 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management s assessment of the business environment  customers financial condition  historical collection experience  accounts receivable aging  customer disputes and the collectability of specific customer accounts 
if there were a deterioration of a major customer s creditworthiness  or actual defaults were higher than our historical experience  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated  which could have an adverse impact on our operating results 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is also affected by the time at which uncollectible accounts receivable balances are actually written off 
major customers accounts are monitored on an ongoing basis  more in depth reviews are performed based on changes in customer s financial condition and or the level of credit being extended 
when a significant event occurs  such as a bankruptcy filing by a specific customer  and on a quarterly basis  the allowance is reviewed for adequacy and the balance or accrual rate is adjusted to reflect current risk prospects 
revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policy is to recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title transfer has occurred product shipment  the price is fixed or readily determinable  and collectability is probable 
sales are recorded net of sales returns and discounts  which are estimated at the time of shipment based upon historical data 
jakks routinely enters into arrangements with its customers to provide sales incentives  support customer promotions  and provide allowances for returns and defective merchandise 
such programs are based primarily on customer purchases  customer performance of specified promotional activities  and other specified factors such as sales to consumers 
accruals for these programs are recorded as sales adjustments that reduce gross revenue in the period the related revenue is recognized 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized  but are tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
due to the subjective nature of the impairment analysis significant changes in the assumptions used to develop the estimate could materially affect the conclusion regarding the future cash flows necessary to support the valuation of long lived assets  including goodwill 
the company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
the valuation of goodwill involves a high degree of judgment and consists of a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its book value 
based on the assumptions underlying the valuation  impairment is determined by estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and comparing that value to the reporting unit s book value 
if the implied fair value is more than the book value of the reporting unit  an impairment loss is not indicated 
if impairment exists  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of its assets and liabilities excluding goodwill  with the excess amount representing the fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the book value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the estimated fair value of that goodwill 
during the second quarter of  the company determined that the significant decline in its market capitalization is likely to be sustained 
the company s market capitalization was not significantly affected by the substantial resolution of the wwe lawsuit  and the lower revenue expectations for versus were factors that indicated that an interim goodwill impairment test was required 
as a result  the company determined that million  or all of the goodwill related to previous acquisitions  including the acquisition of disguise in december  was impaired 
this amount is included in write down of goodwill in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
during the second quarter of  the company determined that the tradenames child guidance and play along and certain tradenames associated with our craft and activity product lines would either be discontinued  or were under performing 
consequently  the intangible assets associated with these tradenames were written off to write down of intangible assets  resulting in a non cash charge of million 
goodwill and intangible assets amounted to million as of december reserve for inventory obsolescence 
we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market 
based upon a consideration of quantities on hand  actual and projected sales volume  anticipated product selling prices and product lines planned to be discontinued  slow moving and obsolete inventory is written down to its net realizable value 
failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand could result in the company under producing popular items or overproducing less popular items 
furthermore  significant changes in demand for our products would impact management s estimates in establishing our inventory provision 
management estimates are monitored on a quarterly basis and a further adjustment to reduce inventory to its net realizable value is recorded  as an increase to cost of sales  when deemed necessary under the lower of cost or market standard 
income allocation for income taxes 
our annual income tax provision and related income tax assets and liabilities are based on actual income as allocated to the various tax jurisdictions based upon our transfer pricing study  us and foreign statutory income tax rates  and tax regulations and planning opportunities in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates 
significant judgment is required in interpreting tax regulations in the us and foreign jurisdictions  and in evaluating worldwide uncertain tax positions 
actual results could differ materially from those judgments  and changes from such judgments could materially affect our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes and interest and penalties related to income tax payable 
we do not file a consolidated return with our foreign subsidiaries 
we file federal and state returns and our foreign subsidiaries each file in their respective jurisdictions  as applicable 
deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized as deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences 
temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment 
we accrue a tax reserve for additional income taxes and interest  which may become payable in future years as a result of audit adjustments by tax authorities 
the reserve is based on management s assessment of all relevant information  and is periodically reviewed and adjusted as circumstances warrant 
as of december   our income tax reserves are approximately million and relate to the potential income tax audit adjustments  primarily in the areas of income allocation  foreign depreciation allowances and state taxes 
we recognize current period interest expense and the reversal of previously recognized interest expense that has been determined to not be assessable due to the expiration of the related audit period or other compelling factors on the income tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense  and penalties and penalty reversals related to the income taxes payable as other expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
share based compensation 
we grant restricted stock and options to purchase our common stock to our employees including officers and non employee directors under our stock award and incentive plan the plan  which incorporated the shares remaining under our third amended and restated stock option plan 
the benefits provided under the plan are share based payments 
we estimate the value of share based awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price  as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  cancellations  terminations  risk free interest rates and expected dividends

quarterly fluctuations and seasonality we have experienced significant quarterly fluctuations in operating results and anticipate these fluctuations in the future 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
our first quarter is typically expected to be the least profitable as a result of lower net sales but substantially similar fixed operating expenses 
this is consistent with the performance of many companies in the toy industry 
the following table presents our unaudited quarterly results for the years indicated 
the seasonality of our business is reflected in this quarterly presentation

recent accounting standards in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new accounting guidance that provides a consistent definition of fair value and common requirements of and disclosure about fair value between gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
the guidance states the concepts of highest and best use and valuation premise are only relevant when measuring the fair value of nonfinancial assets 
enhanced disclosure requirements will require companies to disclose quantitative information about unobservable inputs used  a description of the valuation processes used  and a qualitative discussion about the sensitivity of the measurements for recurring level fair value measurements 
for assets and liabilities not recorded at fair value but where fair value is disclosed  companies must report the level in the fair value hierarchy of assets and liabilities

asu will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted

although operating activities are expected to provide cash  to the extent we grow significantly in the future  our operating and investing activities may use cash and  consequently  this growth may require us to obtain additional sources of financing 
there can be no assurance that any necessary additional financing will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
we intend to finance our long term liquidity requirements out of net cash provided by operations and net cash and cash equivalents 
as of december   we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
during the last three fiscal years ending december   we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our net sales and revenues and on income from continuing operations 
exchange rates sales from our united states and hong kong operations are denominated in us dollars and our manufacturing costs are denominated in either us or hong kong dollars 
operations and operating expenses of all of our operations are denominated in local currency  thereby creating exposure to changes in exchange rates 
changes in the hong kong dollar us dollar exchange rate may positively or negatively affect our operating results 
the exchange rate of the hong kong dollar to the us dollar has been fixed by the hong kong government since at hk to us and  accordingly  has not represented a currency exchange risk to the us dollar 
we cannot assure you that the exchange rate between the united states and hong kong currencies will continue to be fixed or that exchange rate fluctuations between the united states and hong kong currencies will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
we are exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in united states and international borrowing rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  we are exposed to market risk in certain geographic areas that have experienced or remain vulnerable to an economic downturn  such as china 
we purchase substantially all of our inventory from companies in china  and  therefore  we are subject to the risk that such suppliers will be unable to provide inventory at competitive prices 
while we believe that  if such an event were to occur we would be able to find alternative sources of inventory at competitive prices  we cannot assure you that we would be able to do so 
these exposures are directly related to our normal operating and funding activities 
to date  we have not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities to minimize our market risk 
interest rate risk in november  we issued convertible senior notes payable of million with a fixed interest rate of per annum which remain outstanding as of december  accordingly  we are not generally subject to any direct risk of loss arising from changes in interest rates 
foreign currency risk we have wholly owned subsidiaries in hong kong  china  the united kingdom  france  spain  france and canada 
sales are generally made by these operations on fob china or hong kong terms and are denominated in us dollars 
however  purchases of inventory and hong kong operating expenses are typically denominated in hong kong dollars and local operating expenses in china are denominated in local currency  thereby creating exposure to changes in exchange rates 
changes in the chinese yuan or hong kong dollar us dollar exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our gross margins  operating income and retained earnings 
the exchange rate of the hong kong dollar to the us dollar has been fixed by the hong kong government since at hk to us and  accordingly  has not represented a currency exchange risk to the us dollar 
our mainland china operations are funded in the chinese yuan 
we do not believe that near term changes in these exchange rates  if any  will result in a material effect on our future earnings  fair values or cash flows  and therefore  we have chosen not to enter into foreign currency hedging transactions 
we cannot assure you that this approach will be successful  especially in the event of a significant and sudden change in the value of the hong kong dollar or chinese yuan
