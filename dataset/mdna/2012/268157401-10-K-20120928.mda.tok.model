item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to those consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in addition to historical information  this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations 
overview our principal business is the manufacture  distribution and marketing of physical medicine products and aesthetic products  many of which we design and manufacture 
we offer a broad line of medical equipment including therapy devices  medical supplies and soft goods  treatment tables and rehabilitation equipment 
our line of aesthetic equipment includes aesthetic massage and microdermabrasion devices  as well as skin care products 
our products are sold to and used primarily by physical therapists  chiropractors  sports medicine practitioners  podiatrists  plastic surgeons  dermatologists  aestheticians and other aesthetic services providers 
our fiscal year ends on june reference to fiscal year refers to the year ended june  results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year net sales net sales in fiscal year were  compared to  in fiscal year the  decrease in sales is primarily attributable to the following factors the apparent insolvency of and interruption of purchases by a large  independent distributor that historically purchased between  to  per quarter from the company  and lower sales of capital equipment likely due to continuing weakness of the us economy leading to a postponement of purchases of durable medical equipment 
we also believe the uncertainty surrounding healthcare reform in the united states has had the effect of limiting expansion and improvements in our market sector 
we expect the introduction of our new solarisplus products and quad devices to stimulate sales in fiscal year sales of manufactured physical medicine products represented approximately and of total physical medicine product sales in fiscal years and  respectively 
distribution of products manufactured by other suppliers accounted for the balance of our physical medicine product sales in those years 
sales of manufactured aesthetic products in fiscal years and  represented approximately and of total aesthetic product sales  respectively  with distributed products making up the balance 
the majority of our sales revenues come from the sale of physical medicine products  both manufactured and distributed 
in fiscal years and  sales of physical medicine products accounted for and of total sales  respectively 
chargeable repairs  billable freight revenue  aesthetic product sales and other miscellaneous revenue accounted for approximately and of total revenues in and  respectively 
gross profit gross profit totaled  or of net sales  in fiscal year  compared to  or of net sales  in fiscal year the decrease in gross profit in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales during the year mostly reflects the decrease in total sales attributed to the factors discussed above 
the most significant reduction in sales was our higher margin capital equipment which had the effect of lowering the gross margin percentage as lower margin supplies and distributed items became a larger percentage of overall sales in fiscal year looking ahead  we expect to generate improved sales of higher margin capital equipment with the introduction of our new solarisplus products released in august and the quad in addition  as the effects of healthcare reform become clearer following the presidential and general elections in the united states in november  we expect confidence to increase and demand for our products to begin to strengthen 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expenses were  or of net sales  in fiscal year  compared to  or of net sales  in fiscal year the  increase in sg a expenses in fiscal year as compared to is a result of the following  of higher selling expenses   of higher production labor and depreciation expenses   of higher general expenses including higher regulatory compliance costs and legal fees during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and the first quarter of fiscal year  the company identified over  of annual cost reductions which are being implemented to reduce labor costs through a reduction in force  reduce overhead costs  and improve operating efficiencies 
research and development over the last two years  we have undertaken the most extensive research and development efforts in our history 
more new products will be introduced in fiscal than any year since the company began 
as a result  research and development r d expense increased  or  to  in fiscal year  from  in r d expense increased as a percentage of net sales in fiscal year to from of net sales in fiscal year in march  we introduced the dynatron quad  the first of several new planned product introductions 
the company has been heavily involved with developing five new solarisplus units  four of which were introduced to the market in august these development efforts are directly responsible for the significant r d expenses for the past two years 
by contrast  the average annual r d expenditures in the three years ended june  were  r d expenses are expected to normalize closer to historic levels in fiscal year  as a result of the completion of development of the new solarisplus products 
r d costs are expensed as incurred 
interest expense interest expense decreased by  to  in fiscal year compared to  in fiscal year due to lower negotiated borrowing rates on our bank line of credit compared to fiscal year  and the first mortgage on our salt lake city facility entering the final two years of its term 
income loss before income tax provision pre tax loss in fiscal year was  compared to pre tax income of  in fiscal year the reduction in income before income tax provision for resulted from lower sales and gross profits generated during the year as explained above  along with higher selling  labor  depreciation and r d expenses 
the reduction of gross margin accounted for  of the  difference in pre tax results  or about 
the balance of the difference is accounted for by higher sg a expenses as well as higher r d expenses 
the increase in selling expense was associated with our pursuit of gpo and national account business  while increased depreciation expense was related to increased investments in information systems 
we offset some of these higher expenses with lower interest expense for the year ended june  as noted above  steps have been taken to reduce expenses at an annualized amount of approximately  the effect of which only began to be realized in the last two months of the fiscal year 
income tax provision benefit income tax benefit was  in fiscal year  compared to income tax provision of  in fiscal year due to tax benefits associated with r d tax credits and other credits  the income tax benefit reduced the pre tax loss in fiscal year by compared to an effective tax rate of in the difference in the effective tax rates is attributable to higher r d tax credits in fiscal year  as well as certain permanent book to tax differences 
net income loss net loss was  
per share in fiscal year  compared to net income of  
per share in fiscal year the reduction in net income in was caused primarily by decreased sales and margins generated during the year compared to fiscal year however  the net loss was mitigated by the recognition of significant tax benefits associated with r d tax credit as explained above 
we expect that r d expense will decrease in fiscal year as a result of the completion of development of the new solarisplus products in august we expect improved profitability in fiscal year  due to a reduction in r d expense and with other reductions implemented or anticipated to be made as well as sales of new products that we recently introduced 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed operations through available cash reserves and borrowings under a line of credit with a bank 
working capital was  as of june   inclusive of the current portion of long term obligations and credit facilities  compared to working capital of  as of june  during fiscal year  we generated  in cash from operating activities  used  to repurchase and retire common stock  paid  for capital expenditures primarily related to improving our e commerce and it infrastructure  and paid  in principal on long term debt 
in addition  we purchased  of inventory primarily for the introduction of the new dynatron quad product 
during fiscal year  the outstanding balance on our line of credit increased by accounts receivable trade accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  decreased  or  to  as of june   compared to  as of june  trade accounts receivable represent amounts due from our dealer network as well as from medical practitioners and clinics 
we believe that our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate based on our historical knowledge and relationship with these customers 
accounts receivable are generally collected within days of the agreed terms 
inventories inventories  net of reserves  increased  or  to  as of june   compared to  as of june  the amount of inventory we carry fluctuates each period based on the timing of large inventory purchases from overseas suppliers 
inventory levels increased in fiscal year in conjunction with the introduction of the dynatron quad unit 
accounts payable accounts payable increased  to  as of june   from  as of june  the increase in accounts payable is a result of the timing of our weekly payments to suppliers and the timing of purchases of product components 
accounts payable are generally not aged beyond the terms of our suppliers 
we take advantage of available early payment discounts when offered by our vendors 
cash and cash equivalents our cash position as of june  was  compared to cash of  as of june  we expect that cash flows from operating activities  together with amounts available through an existing line of credit facility  will be sufficient to cover operating needs in the ordinary course of business for the next twelve months 
if we experience an adverse operating environment  including a further worsening of the general economy in the united states  or unusual capital expenditure requirements  additional financing may be required 
however  no assurance can be given that additional financing  if required  would be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
line of credit during fiscal year  the outstanding balance on our line of credit increased by  leaving a balance outstanding of  as of june   compared to  as of june  the increase in the line of credit was primarily the result of  used to repurchase and retire common stock   for capital expenditures primarily related to improving our e commerce and it infrastructure and  in principal payments on long term debt 
we also purchased an additional  of inventory primarily related to the introduction of the new dynatron quad product 
interest on the line of credit is based on the day libor rate as of june  plus 
the line of credit is collateralized by accounts receivable and inventories 
borrowing limitations are based on approximately of eligible inventory and up to of eligible accounts receivable  up to a maximum credit facility of  interest payments on the line are due monthly 
as of june   the borrowing base was approximately  resulting in approximately  available on the line 
the line of credit is renewable on december  and includes covenants requiring us to maintain certain financial ratios 
as of june   we were in compliance with the loan covenants 
the current ratio was to as of june  compared to to as of june  current assets represented of total assets as of june  and june  the lower current ratio reflects the use of short term borrowings to finance stock repurchases  capital equipment investments and repayment of long term debt 
debt long term debt excluding current installments totaled  as of june   compared to  as of june  long term debt is comprised primarily of the mortgage loans on our office and manufacturing facilities in utah and tennessee 
the principal balance on the mortgage loans is approximately  with monthly principal and interest payments of  for a more complete explanation of the long term debt  see note to the financial statements 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses 
management bases estimates on historical experience and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable given the circumstances and evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a high degree of judgment and complexity 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for fiscal year  for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies 
the following summary sets forth information regarding significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
inventory reserves the nature of our business requires that we maintain sufficient inventory on hand at all times to meet the requirements of our customers 
we record finished goods inventory at the lower of standard cost  which approximates actual costs first in  first out or market 
raw materials are recorded at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
inventory valuation reserves are maintained for the estimated impairment of the inventory 
impairment may be a result of slow moving or excess inventory  product obsolescence or changes in the valuation of the inventory 
in determining the adequacy of reserves  we analyze the following  among other things current inventory quantities on hand  product acceptance in the marketplace  customer demand  historical sales  forecast sales  product obsolescence  technological innovations  and character of the inventory as a distributed item  finished manufactured item or raw material 
any modifications to estimates of inventory valuation reserves are reflected in cost of goods sold within the statements of operations during the period in which such modifications are determined necessary by management 
as of june  and  our inventory valuation reserve balance  which established a new cost basis  was  and  respectively  and our inventory balance was  and  net of reserves  respectively 
revenue recognition our sales force and distributors sell our products to end users  including physical therapists  professional trainers  athletic trainers  chiropractors  medical doctors and aestheticians 
sales revenues are recorded when products are shipped fob shipping point under an agreement with a customer  risk of loss and title have passed to the customer  and collection of any resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
amounts billed for shipping and handling of products are recorded as sales revenue 
costs for shipping and handling of products to customers are recorded as cost of sales 
allowance for doubtful accounts we must make estimates of the collectability of accounts receivable 
in doing so  we analyze historical bad debt trends  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable balance was  and  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of  and  as of june  and  respectively 
deferred income tax assets in august and august  our management performed an analysis of the deferred income tax assets and their recoverability 
based on several factors  including our strong earnings history of pre tax profit averaging over  per year in of the last fiscal years and the fact that the principal causes of the loss in fiscal goodwill impairment and expenses resulting from six acquisitions are considered to be unusual and are not expected to recur in the near future  we believe that it is more likely than not that all of the net deferred income tax assets will be realized 
business plan and outlook during the past two years  we have focused much of our resources and energy on developing new and innovative products 
the scope of that r d effort has been more significant than at any time in our history 
as a result  more new products will be introduced during fiscal year than we have introduced in any other year 
in march  we introduced the new dynatron quad therapy device to the market 
the innovative quad utilizes thermoelectric technology to deliver thermal therapy either cold or hot therapy combined with compression treatments through a variety of wraps and innovative thermostim probes 
the thermostim probes are unique in their design as they allow for delivery of electrotherapy treatments concurrent with thermal therapy 
the quad has the flexibility to offer seven different treatments including intermittent compression  cold with compression  heat with compression  cold with stim  heat with stim  cold therapy alone  and heat therapy alone 
this capability dramatically expands both the variety and location of conditions that can be treated 
the quad employs state of the art technology providing precise temperature control moving beyond the current technology by eliminating the need for ice 
thermal therapy in our quad is achieved by using a thermoelectric computer chip technology 
in august  we introduced to the market our new dynatron solarisplus line of electrotherapy ultrasound light therapy units 
this new product line consists of four new units the dynatron solarisplus    and these attractive new units provide our most advanced technology in combination therapy devices by adding tri wave light therapy capabilities to enhanced electrotherapy and ultrasound combination devices 
tri wave light therapy features infrared  red and blue wavelength light 
the new dynatron solaris light pad is capable of treating large areas of the body via unattended infrared  red and blue wavelength light therapy 
as part of the solarisplus product line introduction  we also introduced a new display cart specifically designed for these units 
this new cart is expected to begin shipping in october the solarisplus line is expected to quickly become popular for its power and versatility 
the new units are capable of simultaneously powering five electrotherapy channels  ultrasound therapy  a light probe and light pad 
the commitment to innovation of high quality products has been a hallmark of dynatronics and will continue to be part of our future strategic objectives 
this emphasis on r d contributed in large part to the lower profitability we experienced over the past two years 
r d costs for us have been cyclical in nature 
the higher costs in fiscal year reflect the fact that we have been in a more intense part of the development cycle 
with the new products introduced to the market in august  we expect that r d costs will cycle back to a lower level more in line with historical amounts 
however  we have several additional products that are targeted for introduction in the coming fiscal year that will build on the technology developed over the past two years 
management is confident the higher costs associated with the more intense part of the development cycle in the short term will yield long term benefits and are important to assuring that we maintain our reputation in the industry for being an innovator and leader in product development 
in calendar  we announced the signing of contracts with four group purchasing organizations gpos premier  inc  amerinet  inc  firstchoice cooperative and champs group purchasing 
these gpos represent tens of thousands of clinics and hospitals around the nation 
with the broader offering of products now available through our catalog and e commerce website  we are better able to compete for this high volume business 
over the past two years  we have also been successful in becoming a preferred vendor to many national and regional accounts 
the contracts with the gpos represent a license to solicit business directly from the members of the respective gpos 
the gpos do not order any product directly 
they serve the function of negotiating favorable pricing terms on behalf of their members 
we believe it will require years of effort to develop relationships with the individual gpo and national account clinics and hospitals and convert this business to our brand 
this has been manifest by the lack of significant progress under the limited contracts with premier and amerinet and the decision by other gpo s like medassets and novation to not put dynatronics on contract 
while we will continue to seek effective ways of accessing business with gpo members outside of a gpo contract  the pattern of the gpo s has not been conducive to putting new vendors  like dynatronics  on contract 
therefore  while we will continue to petition for fairer treatment by the gpo s we also realize that the resources that may be required to secure contracts with the gpo s could be more productively deployed in other ways to improve sales of our products 
while we are not abandoning the gpo effort  we recognize that the gpo bar is set very high and we would be better served initiating other strategies to increase sales 
in late or early we plan to introduce a new  updated version of our product catalog 
this new catalog will expand our product offering in order to better service the broader needs of our customers 
it will also provide an excellent new sales tool for all of our sales representatives in the field as well as provide a foundation for expanding our e commerce platform 
over the past few years  consolidations in our market have changed the landscape of our industry s distribution channels 
at the present time  we believe that there remain only two companies with a national direct sales force selling proprietary and distributed products dynatronics and patterson medical 
all other distribution in our market is directed through catalog companies with no direct sales force  or through independent local dealers that have limited geographical reach 
in the past year  we have reinforced our direct sales team to include direct sales employees and independent sales representatives 
in addition to these direct sales representatives  we continue to enjoy a strong relationship with scores of independent dealers 
we believe we have the best trained and most knowledgeable sales force in the industry 
the changes taking place within our market provide a unique opportunity for us to grow market share in the coming years through recruitment of high quality sales representatives and dealers 
to further our efforts to recruit high quality direct sales representatives and dealers  we intend to continue to improve efficiencies of our operations and the sales support for the industry 
chief among the steps we are taking to make these improvements was the introduction of our first true e commerce solution on july  and the enhancements to that portal in the two years since its introduction 
with the availability of this e commerce solution  customers are able to more easily place orders and obtain information about their accounts 
sales representatives are increasing their effectiveness with the abundance of information available to them electronically through our e quote system  which is a companion to the e commerce solution introduced 
not only is our e commerce solution easy and efficient to use  it should also facilitate reducing transactional costs thus enabling us to accommodate higher sales without significantly increasing overhead 
the passage in of the patient protection and affordable care act and with the health care and educational reconciliation act will affect our future operations 
the addition of millions to the rolls of the insured is expected to increase demand for services 
that increased demand could lead to increased sales of our products 
the magnitude of those increases is difficult to assess at this time 
a negative impact of this legislation as enacted is its imposition of an excise tax on all manufacturers and importers of medical devices 
an excise tax is assessed against sales  not profits 
therefore  even in a year when we may have no profits  we will still owe the excise tax to the federal government 
barring a change in the statute  we estimate that this tax would be approximately  to  annually based on current sales levels 
because of the phase in of various provisions in the legislation  the impact of the elections  and possible legislative actions  we cannot predict what the full effects of this legislation on our business and industry will be 
the first impact is expected in the early part of calendar year in addition  rule making under the law is not yet complete which could mean a temporary postponement in implementing the tax 
in the meantime  we are taking full advantage of every opportunity presented by this legislation to increase sales and to offset any negative effects that may accompany those opportunities 
should the tax become effective january  as anticipated  we will likely be compelled to raise prices as a reflection of that new tax 
economic pressures from the recent recession in the united states have affected available credit that would facilitate large capital purchases  and have also reduced demand for discretionary services such as those provided by the purchasers of our aesthetic products 
as a result  we reduced our expenses in the synergie department 
we believe that our aesthetic devices remain the best value on the market and we are seeking innovative ways to market these products  including strategic partnerships  both domestic and international  to help enhance sales momentum 
we have long believed that international markets present an untapped potential for growth and expansion 
adding new distributors in several countries will be the key to this expansion effort 
we remain committed to finding the most effective ways to expand our markets internationally 
over the coming year  our efforts will be focused on partnering with key manufacturers and distributors interested in our product line or technology 
our utah facility  where all electrotherapy  ultrasound  traction  light therapy and synergie products are manufactured  is certified to iso  an internationally recognized standard of excellence in medical device manufacturing 
this designation is an important requirement in obtaining the ce mark certification  which allows us to market our products in the european union and in other international locations 
refining our business model for supporting sales representatives and distributors also will be a focal point of operations 
we will continue to evaluate the most efficient ways to maintain our satellite sales offices and warehouses 
the ongoing refinement of this model is expected to yield further efficiencies that will better achieve sales goals while  at the same time  reduce expenses 
our efforts to prudently reduce costs in the face of some economic uncertainty have made us a leaner operation 
during calendar  we identified a number of cost saving measures totaling more than  annually that have been or will be implemented to reduce expenses 
we will continue to be vigilant in maintaining appropriate overhead costs and operating costs while still providing support for anticipated increases in sales from our new products 
based on our defined strategic initiatives  we are focusing our resources in the following areas increasing market share of manufactured capital products by promoting sales of our new state of the art dynatron quad and dynatron solarisplus products introduced in calendar introducing additional new products to better capitalize on opportunities in our core market including the market for the quad technology 
the introduction of additional new products in the coming year is made possible by the technology platform built over the past two years of intense r d effort 
therefore  the new products can be introduced with minimal additional r d expenditures 
continue to seek ways of petitioning for more business with gpo s  but redirect focus to more viable and immediate opportunities in the private practice market including customers that may be members of gpo s  but not required to purchase under a gpo contract 
increased focus will be given to developing business with large chains of clinics  including national and regional accounts 
introducing a new product catalog featuring a broader product offering 
using our e commerce solution in order to facilitate business opportunities and reduce transactional costs 
reinforcing distribution through a strategy of recruiting direct sales representatives and working closely with the most successful distributors of capital equipment 
improving operational efficiencies by reducing costs to be more reflective of current levels of sales 
strengthening pricing management and procurement methodologies 
minimizing expense associated in the synergie department until demand for capital equipment re emerges  and  in the meantime  seeking additional independent distributors and strategic partnerships 
focusing international sales efforts on identifying key distributors and strategic partners who could represent the company s product line  particularly in europe 
improving efficiencies as a distributor of other manufacturers products and considering ways to enhance our role as a distributor and not just a manufacturer 
exploring strategic business alliances that will leverage and complement our competitive strengths  increase market reach and supplement capital resources
