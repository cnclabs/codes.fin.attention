during the period from august through december   we repurchased approximately  shares at an average price of per share 
total consideration for the repurchased stock was approximately  from august through may  we purchased approximately  shares of our common stock for total cash consideration of  representing an average price of per share 
in may  in connection with an amendment to our credit agreement  we suspended our stock repurchase program

executive overview we experienced a significant improvement in our operating results for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
our sales increased and our net income increased to  as compared to a net loss of  in the prior year period 
our increase in sales was attributable to increases of and  respectively  at both our power and electronics groups 
the significant increase in our net income was principally due to the increase sales  an increase in gross margin and a decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales 
the significant increase in our net income was partially offset by approximately million of costs related to the non renewal of the former chief executive officer employment agreement and intangible asset and goodwill impairment charges that adversely affected the prior year 
in addition  after completing our impairment testing of goodwill  we concluded that there was no impairment to recorded goodwill at december  in  we recorded impairment charges of  and  in connection with our goodwill and recorded intangible assets  respectively  arising from the ics acquisition in all goodwill and intangible assets related to our acquisition of ics have been written off at december  our backlog at december  was approximately  compared to  at december  there is no seasonality to our business 
our shipping schedules are generally determined by the shipping schedules outlined in the purchase orders received from our customers 
both of our operating segments are pursuing a significant number of business opportunities and while we are confident that we will receive many of the orders we are pursuing  there can be no assurance as to the ultimate receipt and timing of these orders 
our success over the past year has strengthened our balance sheet as evidenced by our to current ratio at december  in march  we entered into a credit agreement with a commercial lender pursuant to which we a established a line of credit up to  and b entered into a term loan in the amount of approximately  these facilities were used to pay off in full our obligations to our former primary lender pursuant to a prior credit facility and to provide us general working capital needs 
as a result of our fourth quarter loss due mainly to costs associated with the non renewal of our former chief executive officer s employment agreement  we were not in compliance with one of our financial covenants at december  however  we did negotiate an amendment to our credit agreement in march and obtained a waiver relating to the covenant violation 
we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants during critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and the results of operations are based on our financial statements and the data used to prepare them 
our financial statements have been prepared based on accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
on an on going basis  we re evaluate our judgments and estimates including those related to inventory valuation  the valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset  goodwill impairment  valuation of share based compensation  revenue and cost recognition on long term contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method and other than temporary impairment on marketable securities 
these estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under current business conditions and circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
inventories inventory is valued at the lower of cost average cost method and specific identification or market 
inventory items are reviewed regularly for excess and obsolete inventory based on an estimated forecast of product demand 
demand for our products can be forecasted based on current backlog  customer options to reorder under existing contracts  the need to retrofit older units and parts needed for general repairs 
although we make every effort to insure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have an impact on the level of obsolete material in our inventory and operating results could be affected  accordingly 
however  world events which forced our country into various conflicts have resulted in increased usage of hardware and equipment which are now in need of repair and refurbishment 
this could lead to increased product demand as well as the use of some older inventory items that we had previously determined obsolete 
in addition  recently announced reductions in defense spending may result in deferral or cancellation of purchases of new equipment  which may require refurbishment of existing equipment 
deferred tax asset at december   we had an alternative minimum tax credit of approximately  with no limitation on the carry forward period and federal and state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately  and  respectively  that expire through approximately  of federal net operating loss carry forwards expire in in addition  we receive a tax deduction when our employees exercise their non qualified stock options thereby increasing our deferred tax asset 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that a portion of the amount may not be realized 
we estimate our valuation allowance based on an estimated forecast of our future profitability 
any significant changes in future profitability resulting from variations in future revenues or expenses could affect the valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset and operating results could be affected  accordingly 
if our strong profitability from continues during  we will evaluate the possible reduction of some or all of the valuation allowance relating to our deferred tax asset 
the reduction of some or all of our valuation allowance would create a deferred tax benefit  resulting in an increase to net income in our consolidated statement of operations 
impairment of goodwill the balance of our goodwill for each of our operating units as of december  is as follows tdl  and behlman   after adopting accounting standards update asu  we performed a qualitative assessment of behlman s goodwill and concluded that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of behlman was less than its carrying amount 
this assessment was based on certain factors  such as i behlman s record bookings and revenue in  ii behlman s strong net income in  and iii based on the goodwill impairment test  behlman s fair value exceeded its carrying amount by 
in determining the recoverability of tdl s goodwill  assumptions were made regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the assets 
after completing the quantitative impairment testing of goodwill for tdl  we concluded that goodwill was not impaired at december  at december   we concluded that an impairment charge should be taken for the remaining carrying value of ics goodwill and intangible assets in connection with the acquisition of this business in our analysis of tdl s goodwill employed the use of both a market and income approach 
significant assumptions used in the income approach include growth and discount rates  margins and our weighted average cost of capital 
we used historical performance and management estimates of future performance to determine margins and growth rates 
our weighted average cost of capital included a review and assessment of market and capital structure assumptions 
based on tdl s goodwill impairment test at december   tdl had a fair value that was in excess of its carrying value by approximately 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating changes and to estimate future cash flows 
changes in our actual results and or estimates or any of our other assumptions used in our analysis could result in a different conclusion 
share based compensation we account for share based compensation awards by recording compensation based on the fair value of the awards on the date of grant and expensing such compensation over the vesting periods of the awards  which is generally one to ten years 
total share based compensation expense was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during  no shares of restricted stock or stock options were granted 
during   shares of restricted stock and no stock options were granted 
revenue and cost recognition we recognize a substantial portion of our revenue upon the delivery of product 
we recognize such revenue when title and risk of loss are transferred to our customer and when there is i persuasive evidence that an arrangement with the customer exists  which is generally a customer purchase order  ii the selling price is fixed and determinable  iii collection of the customer receivable is deemed probable  and iv we do not have any continuing obligations 
however  for certain products  revenue and costs under larger  long term contracts are reported on the percentage of completion method 
for projects where materials have been purchased  but have not been placed in production  the costs of such materials are excluded from costs incurred for the purpose of measuring the extent of progress toward completion 
the amount of earnings recognized at the financial statement date is based on an efforts expended method  which measures the degree of completion on a contract based on the amount of labor dollars incurred compared to the total labor dollars expected to complete the contract 
when an ultimate loss is indicated on a contract  the entire estimated loss is recorded in the period the loss is identified 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts represent an asset that will be liquidated in the normal course of contract completion  which at times may require more than one year 
the components of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts are the sum of the related contract s direct material  direct labor  and manufacturing overhead and estimated earnings less accounts receivable billings 
we had no contracts outstanding at december   accounted for under the percentage of completion method 
marketable securities we currently have approximately  invested primarily in corporate bonds 
we treat our investments as available for sale which requires us to assess our portfolio each reporting period to determine whether declines in fair value below book value are considered to be other than temporary 
we must first determine that we have both the intent and ability to hold a security for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in its fair value to its amortized cost 
in assessing whether the entire amortized cost basis of the security will be recovered  we compare the present value of future cash flows expected to be collected from the security determination of fair value with the amortized cost basis of the security 
if the impairment is determined to be other than temporary  the investment is written down to its fair value and the write down is included in earnings as a realized loss  and a new cost is established for the security 
any further impairment of the security related to all other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income 
any subsequent recovery in fair value is not recognized until the security either is sold or matures 
we use several factors in our determination of the cash flows expected to be collected including i the length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost  ii the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  iii whether a decline in fair value is attributable to adverse conditions specifically related to the security or specific conditions in an industry  iv whether interest payments continue to be made  and v any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency 
results of operations year ended december  vs 
year ended december  we currently operate in two industry segments 
our orbit instrument division and our tdl subsidiary are engaged in the design and manufacture of electronic components and subsystems  and our ics subsidiary performs system integration for gun weapons systems and fire control interface as well as logistics support and documentation which collectively comprise our electronics group 
our behlman subsidiary is engaged in the design and manufacture of commercial power units and cots power solutions which comprises our power group 
consolidated net sales for the year ended december  increased by to  from  for the year ended december  due to higher sales from both our power and electronics groups 
sales from our power group increased by due to an increase in sales from both its commercial and cots divisions 
the increase in the power group s sales was principally due to an increase in bookings and an increase in shipments pursuant to customer delivery schedules 
sales from our electronics group increased by due to an increase in sales at our orbit instrument division and despite a decrease in sales at our tdl subsidiary and a slight decrease in sales at our ics subsidiary 
the increase in sales at our orbit instrument division was principally due to an in increase in shipments pursuant to customer delivery schedules 
gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  for the year ended december  increased to from for the prior year 
this increase was primarily the result of higher gross profit from both our power and electronics groups which was principally due to operating leverage inherent in our business due to the increase in sales at both our operating segments during the year 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  principally due to higher selling  general and administrative expenses from both our electronics and power groups and despite lower corporate costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of sales  for the year ended december  decreased to from for the year ended december  principally due to the increase in sales and despite the increase in expenses 
interest expense for the year ended december  decreased to  from  for the year ended december  due principally to a decrease in the amounts owed to lenders under our term debt and line of credit 
investment and other income for the year ended december  decreased to  from  for the prior year principally due to recorded gains of  on corporate bonds sold in the prior year and lower amounts invested during the current year and despite a  gain on the sale of corporate bonds during the current year 
net income before income tax provision was  for the year ended december  compared to a loss of  for the year ended december  the increase in income was principally due to the increase in sales and gross profit from both our electronics and power groups and a decrease in the costs related to the non renewal of the former chief executive officer contract and interest expense and despite an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses and a decrease in investment and other income 
income taxes for the year ended december  and was  and  respectively  consisting of state income and federal minimum taxes that cannot be offset by any state or federal net operating loss carry forwards 
as a result of the foregoing  net income for the year ended december  was  compared to a net loss of  for the year ended december  ebitda is a non gaap financial measure and should not be construed as an alternative to net income 
an element of our growth strategy has been through strategic acquisitions which have been substantially funded through the issuance of debt 
this has resulted in significant interest expense and amortization expense 
ebitda is presented as additional information because we believe it is useful to our investors and management as a measure of cash generated by our business operations that will be used to service our debt and fund future acquisitions as well as provide an additional element of operating performance 
earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda for the year ended december  increased to  compared to a loss of  for the year ended december  listed below is the ebitda reconciliation to net income loss year ended december  net income loss interest expense income tax expense goodwill and intangible asset impairment depreciation and amortization ebitda liquidity  capital resources and inflation working capital increased to  at december  as compared to  at december  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to at december  compared to to at december  the increase in working capital was due principally to the net income for the year and despite the repayment of debt and liability associated with our former chief executive officer 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was  primarily attributable to the net income for the year  the non cash depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation  a decrease in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings  other current assets and accrued expenses and despite an increase in inventory  accounts receivable and a decrease in the liability associated with our former chief executive officer  deferred income and customer advances

cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended december  was  attributable to the repayments of long term debt  note payable bank and purchase of treasury stock that was partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises 
on march   we entered into a credit agreement the credit agreement with a commercial lender pursuant to which we  a established a line of credit of up to  and b entered into a term loan in the amount of approximately  these credit facilities were used to pay off all of our obligations to our former primary lender and to provide for our general working capital needs 
the credit facilities are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets 
the term loan is payable in consecutive monthly installments of principal and interest and matures on march  the line of credit and term loan bear interest equal to the prime rate of interest plus and the prime rate of interest plus  respectively 
the credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and certain financial covenants 
available borrowings under the line of credit are subject to a borrowing base of eligible accounts receivable and inventory  as defined 
the credit agreement also contains customary events of default such as non payment  bankruptcy and material adverse change 
there were no outstanding borrowings under the line of credit as of december  as a result of our loss in the fourth quarter of  primarily due to the costs associated with the non renewal of our former chief executive officer s employment agreement  we were not in compliance with one of our financial covenants at december  in march  we and our lender agreed to i waive the covenant default  ii replace a financial covenant ratio for the first two quarters of with a new covenant related to the our operating profitability  iii modify the definition of a certain financial covenant  iv institute a new covenant related to the company s liquidity  and v extend the expiration date of our line of credit to august  the lender  in consideration of such waiver and amendment  assessed a waiver fee of  plus legal fees  but did not change the interest rate on our line of credit or term debt 
we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants during at december   our restricted cash balance of approximately  consisted of a money market account which we have pledged as a continuing security interest relating to our term debt 
we expect our primary lender to remove the collateral pledge on the money market account in the second quarter of in august  our primary lender extended the expiration date of our line of credit from august  to october  and during september  the expiration date of our line of credit was extended to june  our existing capital resources  including our bank credit facilities and our cash flow from operations  are expected to be adequate to cover our cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
in august  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program through december  allowing us to purchase up to million of our outstanding shares of common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions 
during the period from august through may  we repurchased approximately  shares at an average price of per share 
total consideration for the repurchased stock was approximately  in may  in connection with the amendment to our credit agreement  we suspended our stock repurchase program 
in february  the company was granted authorization by its primary lender to purchase up to  of its common stock 
in march  the company purchased  in privately negotiated transactions   shares of its common stock for total cash consideration of approximately  inflation has not materially impacted the operations of our company 
off balance sheet arrangements none 
certain material trends backlog at december  was million compared to million at september  and million at december  an mk order for ics  valued at million  had been included in last year s backlog  however  a new mk order for foreign military sales is not expected to be awarded until the reduction in backlog is also due to a decrease in the orbit instrument division backlog 
however  our backlog as of february  increased to million 
in  our orbit instrument division  recorded bookings of over  its highest level in many years 
however  in  mostly due to program contract delays  bookings fell to approximately  the division was notified by its prime contractor on a program in which the division provides one of its products related to federal aviation administration faa air traffic control towers that the prime contractor was seeking to procure a significant number of units which could approximate in excess of  the division received orders for these products in excess of  in and received an order for approximately  in the first quarter of delivery schedules for these units have been tentatively determined and the delay has not changed the customer s requirements for shipments needed in the division has commenced the procurement process for these units so that the delivery schedule for can be met 
our orbit instrument division also received an order for its rcu on the common transponder program for approximately  with deliveries expected in and the initial delay in the receipt of orders for the faa and common transponder program contributed to the decrease in backlog at the instrument division at december  however  in the first quarter of  in addition to the orders received for the faa keyboards and rcu s  the division received orders from the us navy for its color programmable entry panels worth approximately  with an option to procure additional panels equal to approximately  orders for the additional panels are expected to be received in increments through the end of as a result of these orders  bookings for the instrument division for the first quarter of exceeded  due to its increased backlog from december   our orbit instrument division appears well positioned for strong revenue and profitability for ics did not receive a follow on award for its mk gun console system for delivery 
however  it does expect future orders on this program for foreign military sales 
ics is expecting the first order for foreign military sales to be awarded in late ics developed and shipped three prototype serial data converter sdc units during the second quarter of and received an order for two additional prototype sdcs for delivery in the first half of ics is currently bidding for the sdc initial production work 
however  the potential revenue from the sdc is not expected to fully replace the revenue lost on the mk ics is currently working on other business opportunities and has taken certain cost saving initiatives including a slight reduction in personnel and the consolidation of its two operating facilities into one 
tdl continues to work with several prime contractors on new prototype and pre production orders and many of these opportunities have been delayed in moving to the initial production stage 
however  during the fourth quarter of  tdl did receive three anticipated new prototype awards  which were shipped in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of we expect that these awards will progress to initial production sometime during in addition  tdl s backlog increased since year end due to a million contract it received for the ground mobile marketplace 
tdl is also expecting orders for an additional  in avionic displays by the end of the second quarter 
due to its increased backlog and these pending orders  we are expecting increased revenue and improved profitability from tdl for business conditions at our power group remain very strong with continued bookings for both the commercial and cots divisions 
in particular  in  bookings increased by  record revenue was recorded and the group entered with a record backlog 
beginning in  bookings have remained robust and we expect to continue to receive follow on orders for legacy programs in both our cots and commercial divisions 
operating results for the power group were excellent for and we expect these results to continue in looking ahead to  we expect our two largest operating units  our power group and our orbit instrument division  to remain strong 
our power group is well positioned for strong operating results for and orbit instrument division  assuming the timely receipt of follow on business opportunities  should also continue good operating results in we do expect improved results from our tdl operating unit in based on its increased backlog to date 
for our smallest operating unit  ics  due to a reduction in operating costs in and into  operating results will be driven by the timely receipt of certain production orders in the first half of in summary  based upon our backlog  delivery schedules and expected orders  we anticipate another year of strong operating performance in  although as was the case in  our comparable and sequential quarterly performance may be uneven 
in april  we completed the acquisition of tdl and its operations became part of our electronics group 
in december  we completed the acquisition of ics which also became part of our electronics group 
our electronics group and the cots division of our power group are heavily dependent on military spending 
although we are heavily dependent upon military spending as a source of revenues and income  increased military spending does not necessarily guarantee us increased revenues  particularly  when the allocation of budget dollars may vary depending on what may be needed for specific military conflicts 
due to budget constraints  government spending has come under intense pressure and the defense budget  usually immune from such pressures  will face reduction beginning next year 
reductions in the level of military spending by the us government due to budget constraints or for any other reason  could have a negative impact on our future revenues and earnings 
however  we believe that any future cuts in defense spending will be in certain areas of the defense budget in which we generally do not participate 
in fact  we believe that as military assets return from the middle east  the need for refurbishment and modernization should become a defense spending priority 
therefore  we believe there could be significant opportunities for us as military efforts are curtailed and defense spending priorities are refocused 
however  future business for our company  resulting from these opportunities will also be dependent upon the make buy decisions made by our prime contractors 
although our electronics group and the cots division of our power group are pursuing several opportunities for reorders  as well as new contract awards  we have normally found it difficult to predict the timing of such awards 
in addition  we have several new opportunities that are in the prototype or pre production stage 
these opportunities generally move to a production stage at a later date  but the timing of such is also uncertain 
however  once initial production orders are received  we are generally well positioned to receive follow on orders depending on government needs and funding requirements 
there is no seasonality to our business 
our revenues are generally determined by the shipping schedules outlined in the purchase orders received from our customers 
we stratify all the opportunities we are pursuing by various confidence levels 
we generally realize a very high success rate with those opportunities to which we apply a high confidence level 
we currently have a significant number of potential contract awards to which we have applied a high confidence level 
however  because it is difficult to predict the timing of awards for most of the opportunities we are pursuing  it is also difficult to predict when we will commence shipping under these contracts 
a delay in the receipt of any contract from our customer ultimately causes a corresponding delay in shipments 
despite the expected increase in military refurbishment and modernization  we still face a challenging environment 
the government is emphasizing the engineering of new and improved weaponry and it continues to be our challenge to work with each of our prime contractors so that we can participate on these new programs 
in addition  these new contracts require incurring up front design  engineering  prototype and pre production costs 
while we attempt to negotiate contract awards for reimbursement of product development  there is no assurance that sufficient monies will be set aside by our customers  including the us government  for such effort 
in addition  even if the us government agrees to reimburse development costs  there is still a significant risk of cost overrun that may not be reimbursable 
furthermore  once we have completed the design and pre production stage  there is no assurance that funding will be provided for future production 
in such event  even if we are reimbursed for our development costs  it will not generate any significant profits 
in march  we hired a new investment banker to help us expand our operations and achieve better utilization of our existing facilities through strategic  accretive acquisitions 
through the past several years  we reviewed various potential acquisitions and believe there are opportunities presently available  particularly to integrate into our current operating facilities 
however  there is no assurance that any future acquisition will be accomplished 
in addition  due to current economic conditions and tightening of credit markets  there can be no assurance that we will obtain the necessary financing to complete additional acquisitions and even if we do  there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient income from operations from any such acquired companies to satisfy scheduled debt payments  in which case  we will be required to pay them out of our existing operations which may be adversely affected
