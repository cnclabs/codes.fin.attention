the forward looking statements included in this document are made only as of the date of this report  and we undertake no obligation to publicly update these forward looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances 
overview we re shaped and re directed our business in  featuring the million sale of our subsidiary and the related winding down of our legacy satellite businesses  the progression of our litigation with bssi and boeing  and significant investments in opportunities relating to the ip asset class 
we now operate a fully integrated ip investment and advisory firm that develops and implements strategies to create  acquire  commercialize and license ip 
we launched our ip business by acquiring ovidian group  changing our name to pendrell corporation  and partnering with time warner to acquire contentguard 
in the process  we began assembling a group of professionals with experience in ip portfolio analysis  valuation and monetization  and emerged from with an ip investment and advisory team that we believe is world class 
ovidian group is a trusted advisor to some of the most respected technology companies in the world 
it assists its clients with a variety of ip services  including ip valuation and investment analysis  ip landscape analysis  ip divestitures and ip risk mitigation strategies 
ovidian group has become central to our investigation and analysis of ip investment and acquisition opportunities  as well as the development and implementation of our ip business strategies 
through contentguard  we have a unique opportunity to partner with time warner  a global leader in the production of high quality media and entertainment content 
contentguard holds what we believe to be one of the most significant portfolios of drm patents in the world 
with approximately of handsets worldwide licensed by contentguard  and significant historical revenues  contentguard s patent portfolio is well proven 
contentguard s current licensees include some of the biggest names in consumer electronics  including casio hitachi mobile communications  lg electronics  microsoft corporation  nokia  panasonic  sharp  sony  toshiba  technicolor  sa  time warner and xerox corporation 

table of contents we expect to continue to grow our ip business through our ovidian group and contentguard subsidiaries  and explore new opportunities in the ip business 
we have challenged our team to accelerate contentguard s patent licensing program and continue our expansion into the ip business 
we will also continue our investigation of opportunities outside the ip business to leverage our transactional expertise  financial resources  industry relationships and tax assets to create shareholder value  in ways that may or may not be related to the ip business or historical operations 
as we focus on our ip business and other new initiatives  we continue to divest our satellite assets 
in march  we sold dbsd to dish network for approximately million 
meanwhile  in early  we agreed to sell our remaining meo assets to a separate buyer  with closing anticipated by early may additionally  while we continue our efforts to sell f  we implemented measures to decommission f with the expectation that the decommissioning or sale will be complete by the end of june 
when these activities and transactions are concluded  all of our resources will be available to pursue our ip business and other new initiatives 
we also continue to aggressively defend the appeal of our million judgment for breach of contract  fraud and intentional interference against bssi and boeing 
the california court of appeal heard a second round of oral argument on january   and we expect a written decision by late april after the decision  any party that does not fully prevail at the court of appeal may request reconsideration by the court of appeal or further appeal to the california supreme court  although neither court is obligated to further review the decision 
we cannot predict the timing or outcome of the appeal process 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies require difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies include significant estimates and assumptions made by us using information available at the time the estimates are made 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
our critical accounting policies involve judgments associated with our accounting for the fair value of financial instruments including our previous investment in dbsd  business combinations  goodwill and intangible assets  contract settlements  revenue recognition  stock based compensation  income taxes and contingencies  each of which is described below 
fair value of financial instruments 
we determine the fair value of our financial instruments based on the hierarchy established by asc  fair value measurements and disclosures asc 
the three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities 
level quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities or other inputs that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term of the financial instrument 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities 
this includes certain pricing models  discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs 
in addition  in determining the fair value of our investment in dbsd as of december   we considered several valuation methodologies  including a spectrum transaction analysis based upon the value of relevant spectrum auctions and transactions 
additionally  in connection with the dbsd bankruptcy proceedings  we engaged in negotiations with third parties interested in obtaining our equity interest in dbsd 
the fair value of our investment in dbsd as of december  was ultimately determined based on the estimated value of the consideration we expected to receive from dish network for our equity interest in dbsd  subject to the allocation of the total purchase price to the various assets based on good faith negotiations between the parties 

table of contents business combinations 
we account for business combinations using the acquisition method and  accordingly  the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their acquisition date fair values 
this valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to long lived and intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include but are not limited to estimates about future expected cash flows from customers  proprietary technology  the acquired company s brand awareness and market position and discount rates 
our estimates are based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
goodwill is calculated as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets  including the amount assigned to identifiable intangible assets 
acquisition related costs  including advisory  legal  accounting  valuation and other costs  are expensed in the periods in which the costs are incurred 
the results of operations of acquired businesses are included in the consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date 
goodwill  patents and intangible assets 
we evaluate goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually in the fourth quarter to determine whether there has been an impairment of the value of these assets and evaluate impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of our assets might not be recoverable 
we amortize definite lived intangible assets  including patents  over their expected useful lives 
when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset or asset group may not be recoverable  we perform a test to determine whether the carrying amount of the asset or asset group tested is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
any impairment losses relating to goodwill or other intangible assets are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations 
contract settlements 
with respect to disputed contracts related to the ground infrastructure for our meo satellite system  we continue to record expenses according to our contractual obligation until such contract is terminated 
upon termination  and prior to settlement  we continue to accrue estimated late payment fees and interest expense  as applicable 
upon reaching settlement  whereby the other party s claims are legally released  we will extinguish our recorded liability  resulting in the recognition of a gain or loss on contract settlement 
revenue recognition 
revenue is entirely comprised of fees paid for consulting services provided by ovidian group 
revenue is recognized and billed when our professionals deliver consulting services 
in general  we recognize revenue related to consulting services when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered to the customer  iii the fee is fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
stock based compensation 
we record stock based compensation in accordance with asc  compensation stock compensation asc 
asc requires measurement of all share based payment awards based on the estimated fair value on the date of grant and the recognition of compensation cost over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest 
we record stock based compensation on stock options  stock appreciation rights and restricted stock awards issued to employees  directors and consultants 
the fair value of stock options and stock appreciation rights is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model black scholes model based on the single option award approach 
the fair value of restricted stock awards is determined based on the number of shares granted and either the quoted market price of our class a common stock on the date of grant for time based and performance based awards  or the fair value on the date of grant using the monte carlo simulation model monte carlo simulation for market based awards 
the fair value of stock options and restricted stock awards with service conditions are amortized to expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting period 
the fair value of stock appreciation rights and restricted stock awards with performance conditions deemed probable of being achieved and cliff vesting is amortized to expense over the requisite service period using the straight line method of expense recognition 
the fair value of restricted stock awards with performance and market conditions  and graded vesting are amortized to expense over the requisite service period using the straight line method of expense recognition 
the fair value of share based payment awards as determined by the black scholes model and the monte carlo simulation are affected 
table of contents by our stock price as well as other assumptions 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
asc requires forfeitures to be estimated at the date of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
income taxes 
we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits  tax benefits and deductions 
significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 
we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  we must record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
since our utilization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon future taxable income that is not assured  we have recorded a valuation allowance sufficient to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
however  should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  our tax provision would decrease in the period in which we determined that the recovery was more likely than not to occur 
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc  accounting for income taxes 
the application of income tax law is inherently complex 
as such  we are required to make many assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax positions and the likelihood whether such tax positions would be sustained if challenged 
interpretations and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time  and changes in our assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements 
contingencies 
the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty 
asc  contingencies  requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance update no 
 testing goodwill for impairment update no 

update no 
provides an entity the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if an entity determines that this is the case  it is required to perform the currently prescribed two step goodwill impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized for that reporting unit if any 
if an entity determines that it is unlikely that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the two step goodwill impairment test is not required
