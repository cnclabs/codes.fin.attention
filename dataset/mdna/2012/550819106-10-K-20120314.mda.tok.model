improved absorption of fixed costs due to higher net sales of million and realized manufacturing efficiency improvements and other cost savings associated with fiber parts of the na auto facility contributed to increased gross margin for the thermal acoustical segment 
the performance materials segment reported essentially flat gross margin in compared to  while gross margin for ops was lower in compared to due to a reduction in net sales resulting in lower absorption of fixed costs 
the increase in gross margin in compared to was attributable to improved gross margin from both the performance materials and thermal acoustical segments 
the performance materials segment reported improved gross margin primarily due to significantly higher net sales and the resulting improved absorption of fixed costs 
the gross margin was negatively impacted by restructuring related charges of million  or basis points  associated with the na auto consolidation  included in the thermal acoustical segment 
excluding these restructuring charges in  the thermal acoustical segment gross margin percentage increased marginally in compared to due to improvements in gross margin for worldwide non fiber based products from higher sales partially offset by higher per unit costs for fiber based products at its na auto facility 
selling  product development and administrative expenses in thousands of dollars selling  product development and administrative expenses  percentage of net sales selling  product development and administrative expenses in were essentially flat with reductions in legal expenses of million and severance related charges of million were offset by increases in sales commission expense of million  workers compensation charges of million and salaries and wages expense of million  as well as increases in other discretionary spending 
higher legal expenses in were primarily related to litigation and settlement costs with a former employee 
the increase in net sales in  compared to  caused the increase in sales commission expense in higher salaries and wages expense were primarily caused by annual rate increases 
selling  product development and administrative expenses increased in by million  or  compared to however  as a percentage of net sales  selling  product development and administrative expenses decreased by basis points in compared to the increase in expenses was primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense of million  sales commission expense of million  legal expenses of million  primarily associated with a matter with a former employee  salaries and wages expense of million  severance related expenses of million and research and development trial expenses of million 
because certain businesses met bonus plan targets  the company recorded incentive compensation in  while in the company did not record any incentive compensation expense 
a significant increase in net sales in  compared to  caused the increase in sales commission expense in higher salaries and wages expense was primarily caused by higher headcount in compared to to support the increase in net sales in and strategic initiatives for the company  and  to a lesser extent  the reinstatement of the matching contribution to its sponsored k plan in july  for all non union domestic employees 
gain on sale of product line  net in thousands of dollars gain on sale of product line  net   on june   the company divested its electrical papers product line business for total consideration of million  of which million was paid on june  this transaction contained multiple deliverables  some of which were delivered on june   while others have been  and will continue to be  delivered in subsequent periods 
the company deferred million of the gain from this sale related to undelivered elements of the transaction at june  as part of the sale transaction  the company entered into a manufacturing agreement and a license agreement with the buyer 
under the manufacturing agreement  the company is obligated to manufacture and sell electrical paper products to the buyer for a two year period 
pursuant to the license agreement  treated as a separate unit of accounting  the company granted the buyer the right to use certain process technology and agreed to provide certain services to the buyer to facilitate the transfer of know how for the manufacture of electrical paper products 
under the license agreement  the buyer is obligated to pay the company the additional million on the earlier of june  or completion by lydall of its obligations to provide services to the buyer 
for the year ended december   the company recorded a million gain related to this transaction 
this gain comprised of the gain on sale of million recognized in the second quarter of  net of a write off of million of goodwill that was allocated to the electrical papers product line  and income of million recognized during the six months ended december  as the company provided services to the buyer in accordance with the terms of the license agreement 
the deferred gain amount is being recognized as income as services under the license agreement are delivered in periods subsequent to the sale  including million recognized in as of december   the remainder of the gain  approximately million  will be recognized on a straight line basis over the period that the company satisfies its obligations under the license agreement  which is expected to be completed as of june discontinued operations  net of tax on june   the company sold its affinity business for million in cash 
affinity designed and manufactured high precision  specialty engineered temperature control equipment for semiconductor  pharmaceutical  life sciences and industrial applications 
the company recorded a gain on sale  net of transaction costs and income taxes of million for the year ended december  in thousands of dollars net sales    income loss before income taxes    income tax expense benefit income loss from discontinued operations gain on sale of discontinued operations  net of tax of   income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax  interest expense in thousands of dollars interest expense weighted average interest rate during the year interest expense was higher in compared to due to fully amortizing debt financing costs of million associated with the company s prior domestic revolving credit facility that was terminated by the company during the second quarter of  partially offset by lower average principal balances on capital lease obligations 
interest expense was higher in compared to due to increased amortization of debt financing costs associated with the company entering into a domestic revolving credit facility in march and increases in unused borrowing fees  partially offset by lower average principal balances on capital lease obligations 
other income and expense in thousands of dollars other income  net the amounts included in other income  net  in all years presented are primarily related to net gains and losses from derivative transactions  investment income and net foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
income taxes from continuing operations revised revised effective income tax rate the company s effective tax rate from continuing operations for was compared to in and in for  the difference between the company s effective tax rate from continuing operations and the statutory federal income tax rate was primarily caused by valuation allowances against foreign tax credit carryovers  a valuation allowance against a foreign net deferred tax asset  and dividends from a foreign subsidiary 
for  the company s effective tax rate from continuing operations was significantly impacted by a tax benefit of million associated with a change in assertion regarding unremitted foreign earnings related to its german branch 
this was offset by valuation allowances against foreign tax credit carryovers and state net operating loss carryovers that generated tax expense of million and million of tax expense associated with dividends from a foreign subsidiary 
the impact of those items and a reduction in reserves for tax contingencies contributed to the company s effective tax rate from continuing operations differing from the statutory federal income tax rate in during the third quarter of  the company elected to change its assertion regarding unremitted foreign earnings related to its german branch 
under this election  the company asserts that undistributed earnings of the branch are no longer indefinitely reinvested  but are available for remittance to lydall  inc implementing this change required that the company assume that the assertion was reversed at the beginning of the fiscal year and compute the effect of currency translations from branch inception through january  using exchange rates prevailing during the time that income was earned or remittances were made 
the tax impact of the resulting currency translation adjustment is reflected in the company s effective tax rate and generated an irc section tax benefit of million in this benefit resulted from the german branch having incurred losses during periods of time when the us dollar exchange rates were less favorable compared to the deutsch mark and euro and profits were earned during periods when the us dollar was strong against the euro 
also during  the company recorded valuation reserves against foreign tax credit carryovers and state net operating loss carryovers  which generated tax expense of million 
the reserves reflect the company s assessment that the future realization of such tax benefits was not reasonably assured 
an analysis was performed of the expected future realization of these foreign tax credits generated in before their expiration and  as a result  the company recorded an income tax charge of million in to record a valuation allowance on the available foreign tax credits for which future realization was not reasonably assured 
in addition  a valuation allowance of million was recorded against state net deferred tax assets as of december  in  an income tax charge of million as a result of dividends from a foreign subsidiary and an income tax charge of million to record valuation allowances on foreign tax credit carryovers  primarily contributed to the effective tax rate differing from the statutory federal income tax rate 
the company determined it would carry back its taxable loss to prior years 
this carry back allowed foreign tax credits previously utilized by the company to become available for future use 
an analysis was performed of the expected future realization of these foreign tax credits before their expiration and  as a result  a valuation allowance of million was made in the company s effective tax rates in future periods could be affected by earnings being lower or higher than anticipated in countries where tax rates differ from the united states federal rate  the relative impact of permanent tax adjustments on higher or lower earnings from domestic operations  changes in net deferred tax asset valuation allowances  changes in tax rates or tax laws and the completion of tax audits

the company s management is required to make judgments about and estimates of the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
actual results could differ from management s estimates 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below 
intangible assets and goodwill intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill and acquisition related intangibles 
the company had goodwill of million at december  and million at december  goodwill is not amortized  but rather is subject to impairment tests annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
the identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of reporting units  including related goodwill 
the company s reporting units are operating segments or components of operating segments for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results of that operating segment or component 
on october   the company adopted asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment  which amended the guidance to simplify how entities test goodwill for impairment 
the amendment permits a company to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test described in topic the more likely than not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than percent 
if after assessing qualitative factors a conclusion is reached that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then the company is required to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
in the first step  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of its net assets  goodwill is considered not impaired and no further testing is required 
if the carrying value of the net assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  a second step of the impairment test is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill 
determining the implied fair value of goodwill requires a valuation of the reporting unit s tangible and intangible assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the allocation of purchase price in a business combination 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of its goodwill  goodwill is deemed impaired and is written down to the extent of the difference 
during the fourth quarter of  the company performed its annual impairment analysis of the million of goodwill in the performance materials reporting unit pm reporting unit and million of goodwill in the life sciences vital fluids reporting unit vf reporting unit  included in ops 
for the pm and vf reporting units  the company first assessed qualitative factors to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units were less than their carrying amounts as a basis for determining whether it was necessary to perform the two step impairment test described in topic as a result of these analyses  the company concluded that it was not necessary to perform the two step impairment test for the pm reporting unit as it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the pm reporting unit was less than its carrying value 
as a result  the company concluded that the pm reporting unit goodwill was not impaired 
the company has made significant capital investments in the vf reporting unit s business as a strategic initiative to increase market share in the bioprocessing market 
investments have also been made to increase sales and marketing efforts resulting in higher selling related expenses 
beginning in  the vf reporting unit s business began to initiate the qualification of products with a number of new customers 
however  the length of time required for customer qualification and orders to be received by the vf reporting unit  and the expected improved cash inflows to be realized by the business  has yet to occur at expected levels 
based on the assessment of these factors  the company concluded that it was necessary to perform the two step test for the vf reporting unit in accordance with topic in performing step one of the impairment analysis to estimate the fair value of the vf reporting unit  the company used both i the income approach discounted cash flows  and ii the market approach comparable company analysis 
the income approach involved determining the present value of future cash flows from the reporting unit s projected financial results in and the projected cash flows beyond that three year period computed as the terminal value 
to determine the present value of the future cash flows  a discount rate of approximately was used by the reporting unit  which was the value weighted average of the company s estimated cost of equity and debt derived using both known and estimated customary market metrics 
the reporting unit s weighted average cost of capital was adjusted to reflect a risk and a size premium 
the company believes the income approach was appropriate because it provided a fair value estimate based upon the reporting unit s expected long term operations and cash flow performance 
in applying the market approach  valuation multiples were derived from historic and projected operating data of selected guideline companies  which were evaluated and adjusted  if necessary  based on the strengths and weaknesses of the reporting unit relative to the selected guideline companies 
the valuation multiples were then applied to the appropriate projected operating data of the reporting unit to arrive at an indication of fair value 
the company believes the market approach was appropriate because it provided a fair value using multiples from companies with operations and economic characteristics similar to its reporting unit 
the company weighted the results of the income and market approaches at and  respectively 
the income approach was given a higher weight because it has a more direct correlation to the specific economics of the reporting unit than the market approach  which is based on multiples of companies that  although comparable  may not have the exact same mix of products and may not have the exact same systemic or non systemic risk factors as the company s reporting unit 
the company also considered eitf  deferred income tax considerations in applying the goodwill impairment test in asc to determine whether the fair value of the vf reporting unit should be estimated by assuming the reporting unit would be sold in a stock or asset transaction 
the company determined that an asset transaction was feasible and would result in a higher economic value to lydall relative to a stock transaction 
as an asset transaction  the company believes that a buyer would pay lydall for the buyer s expected tax amortization benefits to be realized in the future for the step up in asset basis 
the company determined that the vf reporting unit  with million of goodwill  had excess fair value over its carrying value of approximately  and as a result  step two of the impairment test was not required 
small changes in future earnings  discount rates  market trends and cash flows could result in a goodwill impairment charge in the future 
the estimates of fair value of reporting units are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment  which incorporate management assumptions about expected future cash flows  as well as other factors such as market capitalization and other market information 
future cash flows can be affected by numerous factors including changes in economic  industry or market conditions  changes in the underlying business or products of the reporting unit  changes in competition and changes in technology 
any changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects  changes in any of the factors discussed above or other factors could affect the fair value of one or more of the reporting units resulting in an impairment charge 
if future operating performance in the vf reporting unit does not reasonably meet expectations or other key assumptions change or are not met  then a non cash impairment charge to income from operations could occur 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on the company s judgment and estimates of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset 
the carrying values of the assets determined to be impaired are reduced to their estimated fair values 
the fair values of the impaired assets are determined based on market conditions  including independent appraisals when appropriate  the income approach  which utilizes cash flow projections  and other factors 
pensions pension cost and the related obligations recognized in the consolidated financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis 
the determination of such amounts is made in consultation with the company s outside actuaries based on information and assumptions provided by the company 
a substantial portion of the company s pension amounts relate to its domestic defined benefit pension plan 
pension plans outside the united states are not significant at december  a significant element in determining the company s pension cost is the expected return on plan assets 
based on a review of market trends  actual returns on plan assets and other factors  including the allocation of the company s investment between equity and fixed income funds  the company s expected long term rate of return on plan assets was lowered to at december   which will be utilized for determining pension cost 
an expected long term rate of return of was used for determining  and pension expense 
in determining the expected return on plan assets  the company considers the relative weighting of plan assets  the historical performance of marketable debt and equity securities and economic and other indicators of future performance 
investment management objectives include maintaining an adequate level of diversification to balance market risk and to provide sufficient liquidity for near term payments of benefits accrued under the plan and to pay the expenses of administration 
the investment plan assets are stated at fair value  which is based on quoted market prices in an active market 
the expected long term rate of return on assets is applied to the value of plan assets at the beginning of the year and this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in the determination of pension cost for that year 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred  within certain parameters  as discussed below 
the company continually evaluates its expected long term rate of return and will adjust such rate as deemed appropriate 
at the end of each year  the company determines the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of plan liabilities  as well as the following year s pension cost 
the discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
the company based its discount rate assumption on an analysis which included the selection of a bond portfolio comprised of high quality fixed income investments whose cash flows would provide for the projected benefit payments of the plan 
the discount rate is then developed as the single rate that equates the market value of the bond portfolio to the discounted value of the plan s benefit payments 
at december   the company determined this rate to be 
increases or decreases in the discount rate result in decreases and increases  respectively  in the projected benefit obligation 
the net effect on pension liabilities from changes in the discount rate is deferred within certain parameters  as discussed below 
pension accounting guidance requires that gains or losses be deferred unless the unrecognized net gain or loss at the end of a year exceeds a corridor as defined in the pension accounting guidance 
if the deferred gain or loss exceeds the corridor at the end of the year  then the amount in excess of the corridor is amortized over a period equal to the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits 
since benefit accruals were frozen on certain domestic defined benefit pension plans on june   these plan participants are considered inactive participants 
therefore  the gain loss amortization for these plans is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of all plan participants 
as of december  and  the net deferred loss exceeded the corridor 
consequently  pension cost for will include amortization of a portion of the deferred loss in excess of the corridor 
the amount of amortization in future years will be dependent on changes in the components of the deferred loss amount  particularly actual return on plan assets in relation to the estimated return on plan assets  as well as future increases or decreases in the discount rate 
for the year ended december   the company recognized pension expense related to its domestic defined benefit pension plan of million as a result of the expected return on assets being lower than the aggregate of interest cost and the amortization of actuarial loss 
as discussed above  the company s discount rate was at december  and was used for purposes of determining pension cost 
pension expense for is expected to be in the range of million to million 
the company contributed million to its domestic defined benefit pension plan during and expects to contribute approximately million in income taxes the company accounts for income taxes recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  the company analyzes historical financial results by jurisdiction and estimates future taxable income  considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss carryforwards 
valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes in tax law  changes in statutory tax rates and future levels of taxable income 
in the event the company was to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future  the company would reduce such amounts through a charge to income in the period that such determination was made 
conversely  if the company was to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts  the company would decrease the recorded valuation allowance and record an increase to income in the period that such determination was made 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return  as well as returns required by various state and foreign jurisdictions 
in the normal course of business  the company is subject to examination by taxing authorities  including such major jurisdictions as the united states  france  germany and the netherlands 
with few exceptions  the company is no longer subject to us federal examinations for years before  state and local examinations for years before  and non us income tax examinations for years before in assessing the need for reserves for uncertainties in income taxes recognized  a significant number of estimates and judgments must be made by the company 
the total amount of net unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the effective tax rate if recognized was million as of december  united states income taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries 
it is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable 
the company s intention is to reinvest these earnings permanently or to repatriate the earnings only when it is tax effective to do so 
the company s effective tax rates in future periods could be affected by earnings being lower or higher than anticipated in countries where tax rates differ from the united states federal rate  the relative impact of permanent tax adjustments on higher or lower earnings from domestic operations  changes in net deferred tax asset valuation allowances  changes in tax rates or tax laws and the completion of tax audits 
equity compensation plans the company accounts for awards of equity instruments under the fair value method of accounting and recognizes such amounts in the consolidated statements of operations 
the company recognizes expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the entire award 
stock based compensation expense includes the estimated effects of forfeitures and such estimates of forfeitures are adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ  from such estimates 
the effect of changes in estimated forfeitures is recognized in the period of change and will also impact the amount of expense to be recognized in future periods 
the company estimates the fair value of option grants based on the black scholes option pricing model 
expected volatility and expected term are based on historical information 
the company believes that future volatility and expected term are not likely to materially differ from the company s historical stock price volatility and historical exercise data  respectively 
the fair value of each option granted is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions for the years ended december risk free interest rate expected life years years years expected volatility expected dividend yield recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 presentation of comprehensive income topic which amended its guidance on disclosure and presentation requirements for comprehensive income 
the amendments also required that reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income be presented on the face of the financial statements 
however  in december the fasb issued asu no 
that deferred the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of other comprehensive income 
asu no 
was issued to allow the fasb time to redeliberate whether it is necessary to require entities to present reclassification adjustments  by component  in both the statement where net income is presented and the statement where comprehensive income is presented for both interim and annual financial statements  as originally required under asu no 
during the fasb s redeliberation period  entities will continue to report reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income using guidance in effect before asu no 
was issued 
asu no 
is to be applied retrospectively and is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning after december  it is expected that the adoption of this asu will have no effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition  or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued asu no 
 fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs asu  which clarifies the wording and disclosures required in accounting standards codification asc topic  fair value measurement asc  to converge with those used to be used in international financial reporting standards ifrs 
the update explains how to measure and disclose fair value under asc however  the fasb does not expect the changes in this standards update to alter the current application of the requirements in asc the provisions of asu are effective for public entities prospectively for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  early adoption is prohibited 
therefore  asu is effective for the company during the first quarter of fiscal the company has not yet adopted asu and the eventual adoption of asu is not expected to have a material effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition  or cash flows 
other key financial items cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents increased to million as of december  compared with million as of december  this increase of million was primarily due to cash generated from operating activities of million  which was partially offset by cash used for investing activities of million and cash used for financing activities of million 
investing activities included million used for capital expenditures  and million used for short term investments  partially offset by million of net proceeds from the sale of affinity 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates resulted in cash decreasing by million in compared to short term investment short term investments of million is comprised of a certificate of deposit with a financial institution that was entered into with proceeds from the sale of affinity 
the certificate of deposit matured on january  and million of proceeds was recorded to cash and cash equivalents 
accounts receivable accounts receivable  net of the allowance for doubtful receivables  were million at the end of compared with million at the end of net sales in the fourth quarter of were essentially flat with the fourth quarter of inventories inventories were million as of december  compared with million as of december  primarily contributing to this decrease was lower tooling inventory  net of progress billings  of million at december  due to timing of projects and billings 
current liabilities current liabilities decreased to million at december  compared to million at december  the largest component was accounts payable decreasing million  primarily due to decreased inventory purchases at the end of the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of benefit plan liabilities benefit plan liabilities increased to million at december  compared to million at december  the increase of million was primarily due to an increase in the underfunded status of the company s domestic defined benefit pension plan 
the increase in the unfunded status was principally due to an actuarial loss of million in due to a reduction in discount rate at december  as well as a negative return on plan assets during working capital and current ratio working capital at december  was million  compared to million at december  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was and at december  and  respectively 
capital expenditures capital expenditures were million in  million in  and million in capital spending for is expected to be approximately million to million 
total debt to total capitalization total debt to total capitalization decreased to in compared with in the decrease was primarily due to lower debt levels in compared to stockholders equity stockholders equity increased to million at december  compared to million at december  this increase was primarily due net income of million  partially offset by foreign currency translation adjustments of million and pension liability adjustments of million 
on a per share basis  calculated as stockholders equity divided by shares outstanding at december   stockholders equity increased to at december  from at december  off balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases  the company does not have any other material off balance sheet financing arrangements 
inflation inflation generally affects the company through its costs of labor  equipment and raw materials 
increases in the costs of these items have historically been offset by price increases  operating improvements  and other cost saving initiatives 
the company also has certain arrangements in which it can pass through inflation on raw material costs to its customers 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk lydall s limited market risk exposures relate to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
foreign currency risk lydall has sales and manufacturing activities in foreign countries 
as a result  financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions in the foreign markets where the company distributes its products 
the company s primary currency exposure is to the euro and  to a lesser degree  the japanese yen and the british pound sterling 
lydall s foreign and domestic operations limit foreign currency exchange transaction risk by completing transactions in local functional currencies whenever practicable 
in addition  lydall periodically enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to mitigate exposure to foreign currency volatility 
lydall utilizes bank loans and other debt instruments throughout its operations 
to mitigate foreign currency risk  such debt is denominated primarily in the functional currency of the operation maintaining the debt 
interest rate risk the company s interest rate exposure is most sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates in the united states and europe  which impact interest paid on its debt 
during  the company had no loans or borrowings on lines of credit outstanding with variable interest rates  therefore  a change in the weighted average interest rate on the company s variable rate debt would not have any impact to the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
the weighted average interest rate paid on variable debt was in and in the weighted average interest rate on long term debt was   and for the years ended december   and  respectively
