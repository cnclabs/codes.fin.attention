on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  product warranties  inventories  long lived assets  income taxes and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors including general market conditions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

the company was a defendant in a patent infringement suit commenced by lectrolarm custom systems  inc lectrolarm in may in the united states district court for the western district of tennessee

under the settlement  the company made a one time payment of million to lectrolarm in exchange for the release of all current and future claims against the company and the dismissal of lectrolarm s suit pending in the us district court 
such settlement amount was recognized as patent litigation settlement expense in the accompanying financial statements along with  of associated legal expense for fiscal although the company and its outside patent counsel believed that the suit was without merit and had vigorously defended itself for over eight years  it decided to settle the matter to end years of management distraction and financial uncertainty since the suit was brought in critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part iv 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue is generally recognized when products are sold and title is passed to the customer 
advance service billings are deferred and recognized as revenues on a pro rata basis over the term of the service agreement 
pursuant to financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  the company evaluates multiple element revenue arrangements for separate units of accounting  and follows appropriate revenue recognition policies for each separate unit 
elements are considered separate units of accounting provided that i the delivered item has stand alone value to the customer  ii there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item  and iii if a general right of return exists relative to the delivered item  delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially within the control of the company 
as applied to the company  under arrangements involving the sale of product and the provision of services  product sales are recognized as revenue when the products are sold and title is passed to the customer  and service revenue is recognized as services are performed 
for products that include more than incidental software  and for separate licenses of the company s software products  the company recognizes revenue in accordance with the provisions of fasb accounting standards update asu  revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu 
asu  which was adopted by the company effective october  on a prospective basis  provides revenue recognition guidance for establishing separate units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement and requires the allocation of arrangement consideration to each deliverable in the arrangement based on the fair value of the elements 
the fair value for each deliverable is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available  third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available  or best estimate of selling price besp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
besp must be determined in a manner that is consistent with that used to determine the price to sell the specific elements on a standalone basis 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of its customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while the company engages in product quality programs and processes  including monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers  its warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from its estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence and slow moving inventory equal to the difference between the carrying cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
technology changes and market conditions may render some of the company s products obsolete and additional inventory write downs may be required 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
the company assesses the recoverability of the carrying value of its long lived assets  including identifiable intangible assets with finite useful lives  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
the company evaluates the recoverability of such assets based upon the expectations of undiscounted cash flows from such assets 
if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying amount of the asset  a loss would be recognized for the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount 
the company s ability to recover the reported amounts of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient taxable income during the periods over which net temporary tax differences become deductible 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company recognized a million charge to provide a valuation allowance against all deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of future realization 
the company plans to provide a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets until such time that it can achieve a sustained level of profitability or other positive evidence arises that would demonstrate an ability to recover such assets 
the company accrues liabilities for identified tax contingencies that result from positions that are being challenged or could be challenged by tax authorities 
the company believes that its accrual for tax liabilities is adequate for all open years  based on management s assessment of many factors  including its interpretations of the tax law and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities 
however  it is possible that the ultimate resolution of any tax audit may be materially greater or lower than the amount accrued 
the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to labor  product and other matters 
the company assesses the likelihood of an adverse judgment or outcomes for these matters  as well as the range of potential losses 
a determination of the reserves required  if any  is made after careful analysis 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
asu clarifies some existing concepts  eliminates wording differences between us gaap and ifrs  and in some limited cases  changes some principles to achieve convergence between us gaap and ifrs 
asu results in a consistent definition of fair value and common requirements for measurement of and disclosure about fair value between us gaap and ifrs 
asu also expands the disclosures for fair value measurements that are estimated using significant unobservable level inputs 
asu became effective for the company for the quarter ended march  and its adoption did not have a material effect on the company s operating results or financial position 
in june  the financial accounting standard board fasb issued accounting standard update asu  presentation of comprehensive income  which requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income  or in two separate but consecutive statements 
asu eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of shareholders equity 
although effective for the company s next fiscal year ending september   asu was adopted by the company in the quarter ended june  foreign currency activity the company s foreign exchange exposure is principally limited to the relationship of the us dollar to the british pound sterling  the euro and the israeli shekel 
sales by the company s uk and german based subsidiaries to customers in europe are made in british pounds or euros 
in fiscal  approximately million of products were sold by the company to its uk based subsidiary for resale 
the company has also entered into certain engineering cost sharing agreements with its uk based subsidiary that are denominated in us dollars 
the company attempts to minimize its currency exposure on these intercompany transactions through the purchase of forward exchange contracts 
the company s israeli based subsidiary incurs shekel based operating expenses which are funded by the company in us dollars 
in fiscal  the company purchased forward exchange contracts to hedge its currency exposure on certain of these expenses 
as of september   the company had forward exchange contracts outstanding with notional amounts aggregating million 
the company also attempts to reduce the impact of an unfavorable exchange rate condition through cost reductions from its suppliers and shifting product sourcing to suppliers transacting in more stable and favorable currencies 
in general  the company enters into forward exchange contracts to help mitigate short term exchange rate exposures 
however  there can be no assurance that such steps will be effective in limiting long term foreign currency exposure
