table of contents part i item business 
company overview we are a national provider of professional and technical specialty staffing services and solutions and operate through our corporate headquarters in tampa  florida as well as our field offices  which are located throughout the united states  and an office in manila  philippines 
kforce  a florida corporation  was incorporated in but its predecessor companies  source services corporation and romac associates  inc have been providing staffing services since kforce completed its initial public offering in august we provide our clients staffing services and solutions through five operating segments technology tech  finance and accounting fa  clinical research kcr  health information management him and government solutions gs 
kforce organizes and manages its tech and fa segments on a regional basis atlantic  north and west 
our tech segment includes the results of kforce global solutions  inc global  a wholly owned subsidiary  which has an office in the philippines 
we believe this operational alignment supports a more customer centric organization  leverages our best leaders  leverages client relationships across functional offerings  and streamlines the organization by placing senior management closer to the customer 
our kcr and him segments  which were aggregated in previous filings as health and life sciences  are reported as separate operating segments for due to recent and then projected economic dissimilarities including revenue and gross profit trends  operating environment  and business drivers 
kcr  him and gs segments are organized and managed by specialty because of the unique operating characteristics of each business 
the following charts depict the percentage of our total revenues for each of our segments for the years ended december  and logo tech we provide both temporary staffing and permanent placement services to our clients  focusing primarily on areas of information technology including  but not limited to  systems applications programmers and developers  senior level project managers  systems analysts  enterprise data management and e business and networking technicians 
the average bill rate for our tech segment for was approximately per hour 
our tech segment provides service to clients in a variety of industries with a strong footprint in healthcare  financial services and government integrators 
a recent report published by staffing industry analysts sia stated the ideal climate has been created for continued growth in the information technology staffing market resulting from a shortage of information technology workers with specialized skills and a demand for technical projects 
the report anticipates that revenues generated from us temporary staffing in the technology sector will surpass the prior peak set in during the height of the dot com boom 
the us bureau of labor statistics bls lists computer systems design and related services among the fastest growing industries reflecting the continuing demand for the high level skills that are needed to keep up with changes in technology 
we believe this segment continues to benefit from our centralized and highly elastic national recruiting center nrc as well as our strategic accounts sa strategy  which we believe will also provide significant leverage in supporting future growth 
our tech segment includes the results of global  a wholly owned subsidiary 
global provides information technology outsourcing solutions internationally through an office located in the philippines 
our international operations comprised approximately of net service revenues for the three years ended december  
table of contents fa our fa segment provides both temporary staffing and permanent placement services to our clients in areas such as taxation  budget preparation and analysis  mortgage and loan processing  financial reporting  cost analysis  accounts payable  accounts receivable  professional administrative  credit and collections  general accounting  audit services  and systems and controls analysis and documentation to support compliance work under section of the sarbanes oxley act of our fa segment provides service to clients in a variety of industries with a strong footprint in financial services and government integrators 
the average bill rate for our fa segment for was approximately per hour 
we believe this segment continues to benefit significantly from our centralized and highly flexible nrc as well as our strategic accounts strategy  which we believe will also provide significant leverage in supporting future growth 
kcr our kcr segment is engaged in the business of providing functional outsourcing solutions for clinical research site monitoring as well as contingent contract staffing and permanent placement of clinical research personnel to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
our kcr segment is also characterized by contracts and relationships that are typically longer term in nature as compared to our tech and fa segments 
a substantial portion of the sales  account management and recruiting functions for the kcr segment is provided out of our corporate headquarters 
over the last few years we have seen a trend  among larger pharmaceutical companies  to achieve greater efficiency and effectiveness through functional outsourcing to large  global clinical research organizations cros  which allows larger pharmaceutical companies to reduce the number of facilities and streamline vendor management efforts 
consistent with the recent consolidation that has occurred within the pharmaceutical sector  a material portion of revenues within kcr is concentrated in a relatively small number of clients 
for the year ended december   the single largest client within the kcr segment comprised of this segment s total revenues while representing of total kforce revenues 
this client has informed us that it intends to migrate substantially all of the services performed by kcr to other vendors 
this migration could be complete as early as december we are currently reassessing kcr s competitive position and  given the changing landscape in the pharmaceutical industry  we are exploring all strategic alternatives for our kcr business  including  without limitation  a possible sale  possible joint ventures to enable us to provide international services  possible acquisitions and the possibility of continuing to operate our kcr business on its present course while we observe and react to industry developments 
him our him segment provides both temporary staffing and permanent placements services to our clients which primarily consist of acute care facilities  physician clinics  software providers and insurance companies 
our him professionals provide services in areas such as medical coding  the revenue life cycle and health information technology 
according to sia  a surge in health information technology and medical coding will continue through given requirements and deadlines for the international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems  th edition icd conversion and electronic health record implementation  which should sustain a strong market opportunity 
on february   the department of health and human services dhhs announced that the federal government will delay the required implementation date for the icd diagnostic and procedural coding system for an unspecified period of time 
an announcement from the dhhs as to a new implementation date is pending 
as with kcr  a substantial portion of the sales  account management and recruiting functions for the him segment is provided out of our corporate headquarters 
gs the federal government is one of the largest consumers of information technology  spending approximately billion in and budgeted to spend approximately billion in our gs segment provides tech and fa professionals to the federal government  primarily as a prime contractor 
gs also serves as a subcontractor to prime contractors  and we believe that our ability to source professional candidates for assignments  in combination with our prime contractor relationships  will allow us to pursue additional opportunities in this sector 
gs offers integrated business solutions to its customers in areas such as information technology  data and knowledge management  research and development  financial management and accounting  among other areas 
substantially all gs services are supplied to the federal government through field offices located in the washington  dc and san antonio  texas areas 
in  gs began to offer its business solutions to the commercial sector in an effort to leverage existing skill sets within gs  thereby  diversifying its revenue stream 
we believe the additional focus on the commercial sector will provide gs with the ability to better manage its risk and promote long term growth of revenues 
types of staffing services kforce s staffing services consist of temporary staffing services flex and permanent placement services search 
for the three years ended december   search represented  and of total kforce revenue  respectively 

table of contents flex we provide our clients with qualified individuals consultants on a temporary basis when it is determined that the consultants have the appropriate skills and experience and are the right match for our clients 
our success is dependent upon our employees associates ability to understand and acknowledge the clients needs  determine and understand the capabilities of the consultants being recruited  and deliver and manage the client consultant relationship to the satisfaction of both our clients and our consultants 
proper execution by our associates and our consultants directly impacts the longevity of the assignments and increases the likelihood of being able to generate repeat business with our clients 
flex revenues are driven by the number of total hours billed and established bill rates 
flex gross profit is determined by deducting consultant pay  benefits and other related costs from flex revenues 
flex associate commissions  related taxes and other compensation and benefits as well as field management compensation are included in selling  general and administrative expenses sg a  along with administrative and corporate compensation 
the flex business model involves attempting to maximize the number of consultant hours and bill rates  while managing consultant pay rates and benefit costs  as well as compensation and benefits for our core associates 
flex revenues also include solutions provided through our gs segment 
these revenues involve providing longer term contract services to the customer primarily on time and materials  fixed price  and cost plus bases 
search the search business is a significantly smaller  yet important  part of our business that involves locating qualified individuals candidates for permanent placement with our clients 
we primarily perform these searches on a contingency basis  thus  fees are only earned if the candidates are ultimately hired by our clients 
the typical structure for search fees is based upon a percentage of the placed individual s annual compensation in their first year of employment  which is known at the time of placement 
we recruit permanent employees from our flex consultant population  from the job boards  from our associates networks  social media networks and from passive candidates we identify who are currently employed and not actively seeking another position 
also  there are occasions where consultants are initially assigned to a client on a flex basis and later are converted to a permanent placement  for which we also receive a search fee referred to as conversion revenue 
we target clients and recruits for both flex and search services  which contributes to our objective of providing integrated solutions for all of our clients human capital needs 
search revenues are driven by placements made and the resulting fees billed and are recognized net of an allowance for fallouts  which occur when placements do not complete the applicable contingency period 
although the contingency period varies by contract  it is typically days or less 
this allowance for fallouts is estimated based upon historical experience with search placements that did not complete the contingency period 
there are no consultant payroll costs associated with search placements  thus all search revenues increase gross profit by a like amount 
search associate commissions  compensation and benefits are included in sg a 
business strategy the key elements of our business strategy include the following retain our great people 
a significant focus of kforce is on the retention of our tenured and top performing associates 
we ended fiscal with a highly tenured management team and field sales team  which we believe will continue to enhance our ability to achieve future profitable growth 
continue to develop and optimize our nrc 
we believe our centralized nrc offers us a competitive advantage and that the nrc is particularly effective at increasing the quality and speed of delivery services to our clients  specifically strategic accounts as well as other demands for high volume staffing 
the nrc identifies and interviews active candidates from nationally contracted job boards  kforce 
com  as well as other sources  then forwards qualified candidates to kforce field offices to be matched to available positions 
the nrc primarily supports our tech and fa segments but is also expanding its support of our kcr  him and gs segments 
due to the significant demand for its resources  the optimization of the nrc in was a significant priority for the firm  specifically its contribution to total firm revenues through an intense focus on job order prioritization 
a continuing focus will be on retention  training  ramping and development  which we expect will i significantly enhance the performance of the nrc in meeting demand through additional contribution  ii enhance our efforts to support future growth and iii expand the nrc as our revenues increase 
focus on our strategic accounts 
a focus of kforce is in cultivating relationships with large clients  both in terms of annual revenues and geographic dispersion 
for each of our strategic accounts  kforce assigns a strategic account executive who is responsible for managing all aspects of our client relationship 

table of contents optimization of flex margins 
as a result of the increases in statutory payroll taxes in recent years  particularly the federal unemployment tax act futa and the state unemployment tax act suta  we face increased challenges to maintain margins for consultants on assignment with both new and existing customers 
we intend to address these challenges through the implementation of select bill rate increases as well as close management of consultant pay rates 
encourage employee achievement 
we focus on promoting and maintaining a quality focused  results oriented culture 
our field associates and corporate personnel are given incentives which include competitions with significant prizes  incentive trips and internal recognition  in addition to bonuses to encourage achievement of kforce s corporate goals and high levels of service 
during  we implemented and went live with a business intelligence tool referred to as amp  which is an acronym for actions maximizing performance  and expanded the platform in to include functionality for the nrc and sa teams 
this metrics based system has provided  and we expect will continue to provide  associates with current and historical performance measures relative to their kforce peers  which we believe fuels healthy competition and assists associates in reaching their highest performance levels 
focus on value added services 
we focus on providing specialty staffing services and solutions to our clients 
the placement of highly skilled personnel requires operational and technical skill to effectively recruit and evaluate personnel  match them to client needs  and manage the resulting relationships 
we believe this strategy will serve to balance the desire for optimal volume  rate  effort and duration of assignment  while ultimately maximizing the benefit for our clients  consultants and the firm 
we concentrate resources among tech  fa  kcr  him and gs to the areas of highest anticipated demand to adapt to the ever changing landscape within the staffing industry 
we believe our historical focus in these markets  combined with our staff s operating expertise  provides us with a competitive advantage 
build long term  consultative relationships 
we believe we have developed long term relationships with our clients by repeatedly providing solutions to their specialty staffing requirements 
we strive to differentiate ourselves by working closely with our clients to understand their needs and maximize their return on human assets 
in addition  kforce s ability to offer flexible staffing services  coupled with our permanent placement capability  offers the client a broad spectrum of specialty staffing services 
we believe this ability enables kforce to emphasize consultative rather than just transactional client relationships  and therefore facilitates the expansion of our share of our clients staffing needs 
achieve extensive client penetration 
our client development process focuses on contacts with client employees responsible for staffing decisions 
contacts are made within functional departments and at different organizational levels within our client companies 
our associates are trained to develop a thorough understanding of each client s total staffing requirements with a view to expand our share of our clients staffing needs 
recruit high quality consultants 
we place great emphasis on recruiting qualified consultants 
we believe we have a recruiting advantage over our competitors who lack the ability to offer candidates flexible and permanent opportunities 
we frequently place candidates seeking permanent employment in flexible assignments until a permanent position becomes available  as well as convert temporary candidates into permanent employees of our client companies 
leveraged infrastructure 
a significant focus for kforce is the continuous advancement of its front end and back office technology infrastructure to improve efficiency and maintain a leveraged platform 
we believe our continuous enhancement of our back office system software provides a competitive advantage through the enhancement of the efficiency and performance of our sales and delivery functions 
we continue to focus on the continual improvement of our front end systems and our back office systems  including our time collection and billing systems 
industry overview we serve fortune companies  the federal government  state and local governments  local and regional companies  and small to mid sized companies 
our largest clients represented of revenues and no single customer accounted for more than of revenues for the year ended december  the specialty staffing industry is made up of thousands of companies  most of which are small local firms providing limited service offerings to a relatively small local client base 
we believe kforce is one of the largest publicly traded specialty staffing firms in the united states 
according to a recent report by sia  companies reported at least million in us staffing revenues in competition in a particular market can come from many different companies  both large and small 
we believe  however  that our geographic presence  diversified service offerings  centralized nrc  sa team  focus on consistent service and delivery and effective job order prioritization  all provide a competitive advantage  particularly with clients that have operations in multiple geographic markets 
in addition  we believe that our diversified portfolio of service offerings is primarily concentrated in areas with significant growth opportunities in both the short and long term 

table of contents based upon previous economic cycles experienced by kforce  we believe that times of sustained economic recovery generally stimulate demand for substantial additional us workers and  conversely  an economic slowdown results in a contraction in demand for additional us workers 
we also believe that flex demand generally increases before demand for permanent placements increases given that companies tend to prefer a flexible staffing model in the early stages of an economic recovery to ensure its sustainability 
from an economic standpoint  temporary employment figures and trends are important indicators of staffing demand  which increased in the penetration rate the percentage of temporary staffing to total employment  increased slightly in after growing significantly in while we believe the macro employment picture continues to be relatively weak with the unemployment rate at as of december  non farm payroll expanded by  jobs in december additionally  non farm payroll growth remained positive for consecutive months through december if the penetration rate of temporary staffing experiences growth in the coming years  which is anticipated by some economists and analysts  we believe that our flex revenues can grow significantly even in a relatively modest growth macro economic environment 
management remains cautiously optimistic about the growth prospects of the temporary staffing industry  the penetration rate and in particular our revenue portfolio 
according to an industry report  the united states temporary staffing industry generated estimated revenues of billion in  billion in and billion in  with projected revenues of billion in and billion in of course  no reliable predictions can be made about the general economy  the staffing industry as a whole  or specialty staffing in particular 
although the results of operations in the gs segment were anticipated to have better long term growth stability during variable economic cycles  we believe our gs segment was significantly impacted in by the political landscape  including the us congress s inability to pass the us federal budget and its continuing to operate under a series of seven continuing resolutions thereby continuing funding at or less than of levels  and the macro economic environment 
the gs segment has been adversely impacted by delays in the timing of project awards  uncertainty about the funding levels of various programs and agencies within the federal government 
additionally  the continuing resolution authority cra for the federal government s budget limits government agencies  unless specifically authorized otherwise in the cra  to only spend up to of the federal government s previous fiscal year budget 
further impacting  modifications to the federal acquisition reform act of redirected funds to small business set asides away from larger prime contractors and emphasized a lower cost strategy as compared to a best value approach 
the us congress s inability to pass the us federal budget and its continuing to operate under a series of seven cras thereby continuing funding at or less than of levels may negatively impact the gs segment s performance 
despite the near term challenges  however  we remain optimistic concerning the gs segment s long term prospects 
technology a significant focus for kforce is the continuous advancement of its front end and back office technology infrastructure to improve efficiency and maintain a leveraged platform 
we believe our continuous enhancement of our back office system software provides a competitive advantage through the enhancement of the efficiency and performance of our sales and delivery functions 
we continue to focus on the continual improvement of our front end systems and our back office systems  including our time collection and billing systems 
the more significant investments in were as follows clinical monitoring management cmm kix this front end custom tool provides rules based capacity forecasting  workforce management  time expense entry  and quality oversight for both our customers and consultants 
we believe it will help to define the future of site management monitoring and enhance our reporting capabilities for more effective productivity tracking 
incentive compensation enterprise ice we believe that this compensation management software  which went live in january  will efficiently manage the processes around all variable compensation within the firm 
we believe that this software will also provide the appropriate visibility to management to manage the performance of our associates and help to ensure that kforce s pay for performance philosophy is adhered to 
we expect to continue to invest in our infrastructure  as we believe it will provide for a sufficient return on capital and support the future growth in our business 
while we believe our technology systems are adequate to meet our current needs  there can be no assurance that they will not be subject to system outages or data loss caused by natural or man made disasters 
in addition  kforce depends on certain third party vendors whose reliability we cannot guarantee going forward 
one or more of such events could negatively impact our ability to conduct our business in the ordinary course 

table of contents trade names and trademarks the kforce trade names and the data confidence trademarks are important to our business 
our primary trade names and trademarks are registered with the united states patent and trademark office 
regulatory environment staffing firms are generally subject to one or more of the following types of government regulations i regulation of the employer employee relationship between a firm and its flexible staff  ii registration  licensing  recordkeeping and reporting requirements and iii substantive limitations on their operations 
staffing firms are governed by laws regulating the employer employee relationship such as wage and hour regulations  tax withholding and reporting  social security and other retirement  anti discrimination  employee benefits and workers compensation regulations 
in addition  the services provided by our kcr segment involve participation in clinical trials of pharmaceutical compounds using human subjects 
this is a highly regulated field subject to oversight and inspection by the us food and drug administration 
in providing staffing services to the federal government  we must comply with complex laws and regulations relating to the formation  administration  and performance of federal government contracts 
these laws and regulations create compliance risk and affect how we do business with our federal agency clients  and may impose added costs on our business 
for more discussion of the potential impact that the regulatory environment could have on kforce s financial results  please see item a 
risk factors below 
competition we operate in a highly competitive and fragmented specialty staffing services industry within each of our operating segments 
within temporary staffing and permanent placement services  one of the more significant barriers to entry is that significant working capital is needed because most employees are paid on a bi weekly basis and customers may take to days to pay 
a number of our competitors have substantially more resources than we possess 
we face substantial competition from large national firms and local specialty staffing firms 
the local firms are typically operator owned  and each market generally has one or more significant competitors 
we also face competition from national clerical and light industrial staffing firms  and national and regional accounting firms that also offer certain specialty staffing services 
in addition  many companies utilize vendor management systems vms for the purchase of staffing services 
generally  vms are systems that allow companies to manage service providers 
industry data shows that larger  more sophisticated companies are more likely to add vms 
vms usage is projected to increase to in up from in and in typically  vms providers charge staffing firms administrative fees of to of total service revenues  and these fees are usually recorded by staffing firms as a cost of services  thereby compressing their profit margins 
while kforce does not currently provide vms directly to its clients  our strategy has been and is expected to continue to be to work with vms providers to enable us to extend our flex staffing services to the widest customer base possible within the sectors we serve 
in the united states  there are staffing firms with more than million in us staffing revenues in operation and thousands of smaller organizations compete to varying degrees at local levels according to an sia report 
several similar companies global  national  and local compete in foreign markets 
our peer group for  which is composed of some of our largest competitors  included amn healthcare services  cdi corporation  ciber  inc  kelly services inc  on assignment inc  resources connection  inc  robert half international inc  sfn group  inc 
which was acquired in september by ranstad holding nv  and volt information sciences inc kforce believes that the availability and quality of personnel  level of service  effective monitoring of job performance  scope of geographic service  and price are the principal elements of competition in our industry 
we believe that availability of quality personnel is especially important 
in order to attract candidates  we place emphasis upon our ability to provide competitive compensation and benefits  quality and varied assignments  scheduling flexibility  and permanent placement opportunities 
because personnel pursue other employment opportunities on a regular basis  it is important that we respond to market conditions affecting these individuals 
additionally  in certain markets and in response to economic softening  we have experienced significant pricing pressure from some of our competitors 
although we believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors  we expect competition and pricing pressure to continue  and there can be no assurance that we will remain competitive 

table of contents seasonality of operating results our quarterly operating results are affected by the number of billing days in a quarter and the seasonality of our customers businesses 
the majority of our operating segments  especially kcr  him and gs  are significantly impacted by the increase in the number of holidays and vacation days taken during the fourth quarter of the calendar year 
in addition  we experience an increase in direct costs of services and a corresponding decrease in gross profit in the first fiscal quarter of each year  as a result of certain annual us state and federal employment tax resets that occur at the beginning of each year 
insurance kforce maintains a number of insurance policies including general liability  automobile liability and employers liability  each with excess liability coverage 
we also maintain workers compensation  fidelity  fiduciary  directors and officers  professional liability  and employment practices liability policies 
these policies provide coverage subject to their terms  conditions  limits of liability  and deductibles  for certain liabilities that may arise from kforce s operations 
there can be no assurance that any of the above policies will be adequate for our needs  or that we will maintain all such policies in the future 
financial information about foreign and domestic operations substantially all of kforce s revenues are derived from domestic operations with customers located in the united states and substantially all long lived assets are located in the united states for the three years ended december  one of our subsidiaries  global  provides outsourcing services internationally through an office in manila  philippines

risk factors 
kforce faces significant employment related legal risk 
kforce employs people internally and in the workplaces of other businesses 
many of these individuals have access to client information systems and confidential information 
an inherent risk of such activity includes possible claims of errors and omissions  intentional misconduct  release  misuse or misappropriation of client intellectual property  confidential information  funds  or other property  discrimination and harassment claims  employment of illegal aliens  criminal activity  torts  or other claims 
such claims may result in negative publicity  injunctive relief  criminal investigations and or charges  payment by kforce of monetary damages or fines  or other material adverse effects on our business 
to reduce our exposure  we maintain insurance coverage for professional malpractice liability  fidelity  employment practices liability  and general liability in amounts and with deductibles that we believe are appropriate for our operations 
our insurance coverage  however  may not cover all potential claims against us  may require us to meet a deductible or may not continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost 
in this regard  we face various employment related risks not covered by insurance  such as wage and hour laws and employment tax responsibility 
us courts in recent years have been receiving large numbers of wage and hour class action claims alleging misclassification of overtime eligible workers and or failure to pay overtime eligible workers for all hours worked 
in addition  there appears to be a heightened state and federal scrutiny of independent contractor relationships  which could adversely affect us given that we utilize a significant number of independent contractors to perform our services 
an adverse determination of the independent contractor status of these firms could result in a substantial tax or other liabilities 
a continued trend by large pharmaceutical companies towards functional outsourcing to large  global clinical research organizations cros could have a material adverse effect on the operations of kcr and kforce 
over the last few years we have seen a trend  among larger pharmaceutical companies  to achieve greater efficiency and effectiveness through functional outsourcing to large  global clinical research organizations cros with international capabilities 
kcr s operations are substantially limited to north america  creating the risk of clients selecting other globally capable organizations for their future needs 
this trend could have a material adverse effect on the operations of kcr and kforce 
our collection  use and retention of personal information and personal health information create risks that may harm our business 
in the ordinary course of our business  we collect and retain personal information of our associates and flexible employees and their dependants including  without limitation  full names  social security numbers  addresses  birth dates  and payroll related information 
we also have access to  receive and use personal health information of patients and drug trial subjects in the ordinary course of our kcr and him businesses 
we use commercially available information security technologies to protect such information in digital format 
we also use security and business controls to limit access to such information 
however  employees or third parties may be able to circumvent these measures and acquire or misuse such information  resulting in breaches of privacy  and errors in the storage  use or transmission of such information may result in breaches of privacy 
privacy breaches may require notification and other remedies  which can be costly  and which may have other serious adverse consequences for our business  including regulatory penalties and fines  claims for breach of contract  claims for damages  adverse publicity  reduced demand for our services by clients and or flex employment candidates  harm to our reputation  and regulatory oversight by state or federal agencies 
the possession and use of personal information and data in conducting our business subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens 
we may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law  regulation  industry standards or contractual obligations 

table of contents kforce may be adversely affected by immigration restrictions 
tech business utilizes a significant number of foreign nationals employed by the company on work visas  primarily under the h b visa classification 
the h b visa classification enables us employers to hire qualified foreign nationals in positions that require at least a bachelor s degree or its equivalent in the us immigration laws and regulations are subject to legislative and administrative changes  as well as changes in the application of standards and enforcement 
immigration laws and regulations can be significantly affected by political developments and levels of economic activity 
current and future restrictions on the availability of such visas could restrain our ability to employ the skilled professionals we need to meet our clients needs  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in  the united states citizenship and immigration service uscis significantly increased its scrutiny of companies seeking to sponsor  renew or transfer h b status  including kforce and kforce s subcontractors 
on january   the uscis issued internal guidance to its field offices that appears to narrow the eligibility criteria for h b status in the context of staffing services 
in addition to uscis restrictions  certain aspects of the h b program are also subject to regulation and review by the us department of labor and us department of state  which have recently increased enforcement activities in the program 
the scope and impact of these changes on the staffing industry and kforce remains unclear  however a narrow interpretation and vigorous enforcement could adversely affect our ability to obtain foreign national labor and or renew existing foreign national consultants on assignment  and could subject us to fines  penalties and sanctions 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to keep or replace all foreign nationals currently on assignment  or continue to hire foreign national talent at the same rates as in the past 
kforce may not be able to maintain sufficient cash flow or borrowing capacity to support operations 
on september   kforce entered into a third amended and restated credit agreement with a syndicate led by bank of america  na the credit facility 
the maximum borrowings available to kforce under the credit facility are limited to a a revolving credit facility of up to million the revolving loan amount and b a million sub limit included in the credit facility for letters of credit 
kforce s liquidity may be adversely impacted by covenants in our credit facility 
borrowing availability under the credit facility is limited to the remainder of a the lesser of i million minus the four week average aggregate weekly payroll of employees assigned to work for customers  or ii of the net amount of eligible accounts receivable  plus of the net amount of eligible unbilled accounts receivable  plus of the net amount of eligible employee placement accounts  minus certain minimum availability reserves  and in either case  minus b the aggregate outstanding amount under the credit facility 
under the credit facility  kforce is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants including but not limited to the maintenance of a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least to if the firm s availability under the credit facility is less than the greater of of the aggregate amount of the commitment of all of the lenders under the credit facility and million 
kforce had availability under the credit facility of million as of december   therefore  the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio was not applicable 
kforce believes that it will be able to maintain the minimum availability requirement  however  in the event that kforce is unable to do so  kforce may fail the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  which would constitute an event of default 
at no time during the existence of the credit facility  or any of its predecessors ie  the credit agreement  the first amended and restated credit agreement and the second amended and restated credit agreement have we failed to meet the minimum availability and fixed charge coverage ratio requirements 
if we did not comply with these financial covenants  such a breach of the credit facility could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and could result  among other things  in the acceleration of all amounts borrowed under the credit facility 
see the liquidity and capital resources portion of the md a in this annual report 
the financial markets may experience significant turmoil  which may negatively impact our liquidity and our ability to obtain financing 
our liquidity and our ability to obtain financing may be negatively impacted if one of our lenders under our credit facility  or another financial institution  suffers liquidity issues 
in such an event  we may not be able to draw on any of the amounts available under our credit facility  or a substantial portion thereof 
kforce s temporary staffing business could be adversely impacted by the health care reform 
the health care and education reconciliation act of that was signed into law in march could have a material adverse effect on kforce by increasing the cost of providing temporary staffing services 
if such an increase occurs  we could experience a reduction in our flex gross profit if there is a delay in or inability to increase bill rates charged to our customers 
we are exposed to intangible asset risk which could result in future impairment 
a significant and sustained decline in our stock price and market capitalization  a significant decline in our or in one or more of our reporting units expected future cash flows  a significant adverse change in the business climate  or slower growth rates could result in the need to perform an impairment analysis in future periods 
if we were to conclude that a future write down of our goodwill or other intangible assets is necessary it could result in material charges that are adverse to our operating results and financial position 
see note goodwill and other intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates for further details 

table of contents significant legal actions could subject kforce to substantial uninsured liabilities 
professional service providers are subject to legal actions alleging malpractice  breach of contract and other legal theories 
these actions may involve large claims and significant defense costs 
we may also be subject to claims alleging violations of federal or state labor laws 
in addition  we may be subject to claims related to torts  intentional acts  or crimes committed by our full time employees or temporary staffing personnel 
in some instances  we are contractually obligated to indemnify clients against such risks 
a failure of any of our employees or personnel to observe the applicable standard of care  relevant kforce or client policies and guidelines  or applicable federal  state  or local laws  rules  and regulations could result in negative publicity  payment of fines  significant damage awards  or settlement expense 
to reduce our exposure  we maintain insurance coverage for professional malpractice liability  fidelity  employment practices liability  and general liability in amounts and with deductibles that we believe are appropriate for our operations 
our insurance coverage  however  may not cover all claims against us or continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost 
kforce s success depends upon retaining the services of its management team and key operating employees 
kforce is highly dependent on its management team and expects that continued success will depend largely upon their efforts and abilities 
the loss of the services of any key executive for any reason could have a material adverse effect upon kforce 
success also depends upon our ability to identify  develop  and retain qualified operating employees  particularly management  client servicing  and candidate recruiting employees 
kforce expends significant resources in the recruiting and training of its employees  as the pool of available applicants for these positions is limited 
the loss of some of our key operating employees could have a material adverse effect on our business  including our ability to establish and maintain client and candidate  professional  and technical relationships 
kforce depends on the proper functioning of its information systems 
kforce is dependent on the proper functioning of information systems in operating its business 
critical information systems are used in every aspect of kforce s daily operations  most significantly  in the identification and matching of staffing resources to client assignments and in the customer billing and consultant payment functions 
kforce s information systems are vulnerable to natural disasters we are headquartered and our leased data center are located in a hurricane prone area  fire or casualty theft  technical failures  terrorist acts  power loss  telecommunications failures  physical or software intrusions  computer viruses  and similar events 
if our critical information systems fail or are otherwise unavailable  we would have to accomplish these functions manually  which could prove difficult or impossible  causing a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  we depend on third party vendors for certain functions including the operations of our leased data center  whose future performance and reliability we cannot warrant 
significant increases in payroll related costs could adversely affect kforce s business 
kforce is required to pay a number of federal  state  and local payroll and related costs  including unemployment taxes  workers compensation and insurance premiums and claims  fica  and medicare  among others  related to our employees 
significant increases in the effective rates of any payroll related costs would likely have a material adverse effect on kforce 
recently  many of the states in which kforce conducts business have significantly increased their state unemployment tax rates in an effort to increase funding for unemployment benefits 
costs could also increase as a result of health care reforms or the possible imposition of additional requirements and restrictions related to the placement of personnel 
we may not be able to increase the fees charged to our clients in a timely manner and in a sufficient amount to cover these potential cost increases 
adverse results in tax audits could result in significant cash expenditures or exposure to unforeseen liabilities 
kforce is subject to periodic federal  state  and local tax audits for various tax years 
although kforce attempts to comply with all taxing authority regulations  adverse findings or assessments made by taxing authorities as the result of an audit could have a material adverse effect on kforce 

table of contents due to inherent limitations  there can be no assurance that our system of disclosure and internal controls and procedures will be successful in preventing all errors and fraud  or in making all material information known in a timely manner to management 
our management  including our chief executive officer ceo and chief financial officer cfo  does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud 
a control system  no matter how well conceived and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the control system are met 
further  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints  and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  within kforce have been detected 
these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty  and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake 
additionally  controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more people  or by management override of the control 
the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions  over time  a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 
any failure by our kcr business to comply with certain regulations  policies and procedures specific to that business could harm our operating results and or reputation 
the services provided by our kcr business involve participation in clinical trials of pharmaceutical compounds using human subjects 
this is a highly regulated field subject to oversight and inspection by the us food and drug administration fda 
any failure on our part to comply with the regulations  policies  or procedures established for a trial  or to comply with good clinical research practices  could result in the termination of the trial or the disqualification of data for submission to the fda 
this could subject us to regulatory sanctions and penalties  create substantial contractual or other legal liability to our client s  harm our reputation  harm our ability to win or participate in future business  and harm our operating results our business is dependent upon maintaining our reputation  our relationships  and our performance 
the reputation and relationships that we have established and currently maintain with our customers are important to maintaining existing business and identifying new business 
if our reputation or relationships were damaged  it could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
in addition  if our performance does not meet our customers expectations  our revenues and operating results could be materially harmed 
we rely on short term contracts with most of our clients 
because long term contracts are not a significant part of our business  other than in our kcr  him and gs segments  future financial results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results 
further  our reliance on short term contracts exerts continued pressure on us when we try to renew contracts with existing clients who may seek better terms upon renewal 
our offshore outsourcing solutions are limited 
many staffing customers are now seeking an offshore solution to support their technology and business process function and  as a result  a significant amount of technology and financial staffing may be replaced by offshore resources 
we provide a limited technology staffing solution through one office in the philippines to certain clients 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against other offshore solution providers or that we will not lose significant market share and revenue 
we do not provide a vms solution 
many staffing customers are seeking to consolidate their use of staffing and solutions services through the use of a vms solution 
kforce provides consultants to these clients through other staffing companies who utilize a vms solution  but we do not currently provide this service directly to our clients 
there can be no assurance that we can continue to effectively compete with those companies that provide a vms solution 
if we must provide a vms solution  we could incur significant costs 

table of contents kforce s current market share may decrease as a result of limited barriers to entry for new competitors and discontinuation of clients outsourcing their staffing needs 
we face significant competition in the markets we serve  and there are limited barriers to entry for new competitors 
the competition among staffing services firms is intense 
kforce competes for potential clients with providers of outsourcing services  systems integrators  computer systems consultants  temporary personnel agencies  search firms  and other providers of staffing services 
a number of our competitors possess substantially greater resources than we do 
from time to time  we experience significant pressure from our clients to reduce price levels 
during these periods  we may face increased competitive pricing pressures and may not be able to recruit the personnel necessary to fulfill our clients needs 
we also face the risk that certain of our current and prospective clients will decide to provide similar services internally 
competition for acquisition opportunities may restrict kforce s future growth by limiting our ability to make acquisitions at reasonable valuations 
kforce has increased its market share and presence in the staffing industry through strategic acquisitions of companies that have complemented or enhanced its business 
we have historically faced competition for acquisitions 
in the future  this could limit our ability to grow through acquisitions or could raise the prices of acquisitions and make them less accretive or possibly non accretive to us 
in addition  kforce may be limited by its ability to obtain financing to consummate desirable acquisitions 
kforce may not be able to recruit and retain qualified personnel 
kforce depends upon the abilities of its staff to attract and retain personnel  particularly technical  professional  and cleared government services personnel  who possess the skills and experience necessary to meet the staffing requirements of our clients 
we must continually evaluate and upgrade our base of available qualified personnel to keep pace with changing client needs and emerging technologies 
we expect significant competition for individuals with proven technical or professional skills for the foreseeable future 
if qualified personnel are not available to us in sufficient numbers and upon economic terms acceptable to us  it could have a material adverse effect on our business kforce may face significant risk arising from acquisitions 
kforce may face difficulties integrating future acquisitions into existing operations and acquisitions may be unsuccessful  involve significant cash expenditures  or expose kforce to unforeseen liabilities 
these acquisitions involve numerous risks  including potential loss of key employees or clients of acquired companies  difficulties integrating acquired personnel and distinct cultures into a single business  diversion of management attention from existing operations  and assumption of liabilities and exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies 
these acquisitions may also involve significant cash expenditures  debt incurrence  integration expenses  and exposure to unforeseen liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
any acquisition may ultimately have a negative impact on our business and financial condition 
provisions in kforce s articles and bylaws and under florida law may have certain anti takeover effects 
kforce s articles of incorporation and bylaws and florida law contain provisions that may have the effect of inhibiting a non negotiated merger or other business combination 
in particular  our articles of incorporation provide for a staggered board of directors and permit the removal of directors only for cause 
additionally  management may issue up to million shares of preferred stock  and fix the rights and preferences thereof  without a further vote of the shareholders 
in addition  certain of our officers and managers have employment agreements containing certain provisions that call for substantial payments to be made to such employees in certain circumstances upon a change in control 
certain of these provisions may discourage a future acquisition of kforce  including an acquisition in which shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares 
as a result  shareholders who might desire to participate in such a transaction may not have the opportunity to do so 
moreover  the existence of these provisions could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock 

table of contents kforce s stock price may be volatile 
kforce s common stock is traded on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol kfrc 
the market price of our stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and could fluctuate substantially in the future  based on a variety of factors  including our operating results  changes in general conditions in the economy  the financial markets  the employment services industry  or other developments affecting us  our clients  or our competitors  some of which may be unrelated to our performance 
in addition  the stock market in general  especially the nasdaq global select market tier  along with market prices for staffing companies  has experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating results 
among other things  volatility in our stock price could mean that investors will not be able to sell their shares at or above the prices they pay 
the volatility also could impair our ability in the future to offer common stock as a source of additional capital or as consideration in the acquisition of other businesses 
risks related to our government businesses kgs is substantially dedicated to contracting with and serving us federal government agencies the federal agency business  primarily as a prime contractor 
in addition  kforce supplies services to the federal government  primarily as a staffing services provider to federal prime contractors 
federal contractors  including kgs and kforce face a number of risks  including the following our failure to comply with complex federal procurement laws and regulations could cause us to lose business  incur additional costs  and subject us to a variety of penalties  including suspension and debarment from doing business with the federal government 
we must comply with complex laws and regulations relating to the formation  administration  and performance of federal government contracts 
these laws and regulations create compliance risk  affect how we do business with our federal agency clients  and may impose added costs on our business 
if a government review or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities  we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts  forfeiture of profits  harm to our reputation  suspension of payments  fines  and suspension or debarment from doing business with federal government agencies 
kgs is operating under an administrative agreement with the united states department of interior doi  which imposes significant training requirements  oversight and controls on kgs throughout the term which is currently scheduled to end on december  the failure of kgs to comply with the administrative agreement during this period could have a material adverse impact on kgs and kforce  including suspension and debarment from doing business with the federal government 
as a result of a self reported billing issue with another federal agency  we are presently in discussions with the doi to extend the administrative agreement up to a year and to add additional components to kgs compliance program 
the federal government also may reform its procurement practices or adopt new contracting rules and regulations  including cost accounting standards  that could be costly to satisfy or that could impair our ability to obtain new contracts 
a failure to comply with all applicable laws and regulations could result in contract termination  price or fee reductions  or suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government  each of which could lead to a material reduction in our revenues  cash flows and operating results 

table of contents unfavorable government audit results could force us to refund previously recognized revenues and could subject us to a variety of penalties and sanctions 
federal agencies can audit and review our performance on contracts  pricing practices  cost structure  incurred cost submissions and compliance with applicable laws  regulations  and standards 
an audit of our work  including an audit of work performed by companies kforce has acquired or may acquire  or subcontractors we have hired or may hire  could force us to refund previously recognized revenues 
if a government audit uncovers improper or illegal activities  we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts  forfeiture of profits  suspension of payments  fines  and suspension or debarment from doing business with federal government agencies 
in addition  we could suffer serious harm to our reputation if allegations of impropriety were made against us  whether or not true 
the failure by congress to approve budgets on a timely basis for the federal agencies we support could delay  reduce or stop federal spending and cause us to lose revenue 
on an annual basis  congress must approve and the president must sign the appropriation bills that govern spending by each of the federal agencies we support 
if congress is unable to agree on budget priorities and is unable to pass the annual budget on a timely basis  there may be delays  reductions or cessations of funding for our services and solutions 
changes in the spending policies or budget priorities of the federal government could cause us to lose revenue 
changes in federal government fiscal or spending policies could materially adversely affect our government agency business 
for example  the us congress s inability to pass the us federal budget and its continuing to operate under a series of seven cras thereby continuing funding at or less than of levels have delayed the timing of project awards  increased the uncertainty about the funding levels of various programs and agencies within the federal government and a resulted in the continued trend by the federal government to in source certain functions 
this trend has adversely affected our business and it could further adversely affect our business if it continues 
our federal agency business is dependent upon maintaining our reputation  our relationships and our performance 
the reputation and relationships that we have established and currently maintain with government personnel and agencies are important to maintaining existing business and identifying new business 
if our reputation or relationships were damaged  it could have a material adverse effect 
in addition  if our performance does not meet agency expectations  our revenues and operating results could be materially harmed 
competition is intense in the federal agency business 
there is often intense competition to win federal agency contracts 
even when a contract is awarded to us  competitors frequently protest such awards 
if we are unable to successfully compete for new business or win competitions to maintain existing business  our operations could be materially adversely affected 
many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources  larger client bases  and greater brand recognition than we do 
our larger competitors also may be able to provide clients with different or greater capabilities or benefits than we can provide 
loss of our general services administration gsa schedules or other contracting vehicles could impair our ability to win new business 
gsa schedules constitute a significant percentage of revenues from our federal agency clients 
if we were to lose one or more of these schedules or other contracting vehicles  we could lose revenues and our operating results could be materially adversely affected 
these schedules or contracts typically have an initial term with multiple options that may be exercised by our government agency clients to extend the contract for successive periods of one or more years 
we can provide no assurance that our clients will exercise these options 

table of contents our failure to obtain and maintain necessary security clearances may limit our ability to perform classified work for government clients  which could cause us to lose business 
some government contracts require us to maintain facility security clearances and require some of our employees to maintain individual security clearances 
if our employees lose or are unable to timely obtain security clearances  or we lose a facility clearance  a government agency client may terminate the contract or decide not to renew it upon its expiration 
our employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities  which could harm our business 
like all government contractors  we are exposed to the risk that employee fraud or other misconduct could occur 
misconduct by our employees could include intentional failures to comply with federal government procurement regulations  engaging in unauthorized activities  seeking reimbursement for improper expenses  or falsifying time records 
employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of our clients sensitive or classified information  which could result in regulatory sanctions against us and serious harm to our reputation 
it is not always possible to deter employee misconduct  and precautions to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in controlling such risks or losses  which could materially adversely affect our business 
security breaches in sensitive government information systems could result in the loss of our clients and cause negative publicity 
many of the systems we develop  install  and maintain involve managing and protecting information used in intelligence  national security  and other sensitive or classified government functions 
a security breach in one of these systems could cause serious harm to our business  damage our reputation  and prevent us from being eligible for further work on sensitive or classified systems for federal government clients 
we could incur losses from such a security breach that could exceed the policy limits under our insurance 
damage to our reputation or limitations on our eligibility for additional work resulting from a security breach in one of our systems could materially reduce our revenues

item legal proceedings 
as disclosed in our previous filings with the sec  kforce was a defendant in a california class action lawsuit alleging misclassification of california account managers and seeking unspecified damages 
the tentative settlement referred to in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  was approved by the court during the three months ended june  in the amount of million  which has been recorded within accounts payable and other accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
on june   the chicago district office of the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc issued a determination on a charge of discrimination  brought by an individual in  that reasonable cause exists to believe that kforce discriminated against a class of individuals because of their age by harassing and terminating them and discriminated against another class of individuals because of their age by denying them employment  in violation of the age discrimination in employment act of kforce believes it has meritorious defenses to the eeoc s allegations 
the eeoc has invited kforce to participate in conciliation efforts  and kforce has accepted the invitation 
at this stage of the matter  it is not feasible to predict the outcome or a range of loss  should a loss occur  and accordingly  no amounts have been provided in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in the ordinary course of its business  kforce is from time to time threatened with litigation or named as a defendant in various lawsuits and administrative proceedings 
while management does not expect any of these other matters to have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows  litigation is subject to certain inherent uncertainties 
kforce maintains liability insurance in such amounts and with such coverage and deductibles as management believes is reasonable 
the principal liability risks that kforce insures against are workers compensation  personal injury  bodily injury  property damage  directors and officers liability  errors and omissions  employment practices liability and fidelity losses 
there can be no assurance that kforce s liability insurance will cover all events or that the limits of coverage will be sufficient to fully cover all liabilities 
we are not aware of any pending legal proceedings that are likely to have a material adverse impact on kforce
