overview we are a leading north american supplier of coated papers to catalog and magazine publishers 
coated paper is used primarily in media and marketing applications  including catalogs  magazines  and commercial printing applications  such as high end advertising brochures  annual reports  and direct mail advertising 
we are one of north america s largest producers of coated groundwood paper which is used primarily for catalogs and magazines 
we are also a low cost producer of coated freesheet paper which is used primarily for annual reports  brochures  and magazine covers 
we also produce and sell market kraft pulp which is used to manufacture printing and writing paper grades and tissue products 
background we began operations on august   when we acquired the assets and certain liabilities of the business of international paper 
we were formed by affiliates of apollo for the purpose of consummating the acquisition from international paper 
verso paper went public on may   with an ipo of million shares of common stock 
selected factors affecting operating results net sales our sales  which we report net of rebates  allowances  and discounts  are a function of the number of tons of paper that we sell and the price at which we sell our paper 
the coated paper industry is cyclical  which results in changes in both volume and price 
paper prices historically have been a function of macro economic factors which influence supply and demand 
price has historically been substantially more variable than volume and can change significantly over relatively short time periods 
our average coated paper prices declined from through the first quarter of while our average coated paper prices climbed modestly beginning in the second quarter of through the third quarter of  they have recently declined again 
prices may not improve  and we do not expect prices in to return to the levels they were at in before they declined 
recent industry forecasts have predicted that prices for both coated freesheet and coated groundwood will decline in the first quarter of we are primarily focused on serving two end user segments catalogs and magazines 
in  we believe we were a leading north american supplier of coated papers to catalog and magazine publishers 
coated paper demand is primarily driven by advertising and print media usage 
advertising spending and magazine and catalog circulation tend to correlate with changes in the gdp of the united states they rise with a strong economy and contract with a weak economy 
many of our customers provide us with forecasts of their paper needs  which allows us to plan our production runs in advance  optimizing production over our integrated mill system and thereby reducing costs and increasing overall efficiency 
generally  our sales agreements do not extend beyond the calendar year 
typically  our sales agreements provide for quarterly price adjustments based on market price movements 
we reach our end users through several channels  including printers  brokers  paper merchants  and direct sales to end users 
we sell and market our products to approximately customers which comprise approximately end user accounts 
in  quad graphics  inc and xpedx  and their respective affiliates  accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our total net sales 
our historical results include specialty papers that we manufacture for thilmany  llc  or thilmany  on paper machine no 
at the androscoggin mill 
under a long term supply agreement entered into in in connection with international paper s sale of its industrial papers business to thilmany  these products are sold to thilmany at a variable charge for the paper purchased and a fixed charge for the availability of the machine 
the amounts included in our net sales for the specialty papers sold to thilmany totaled million  million  and million  in   and  respectively 
cost of products sold the principal components of our cost of sales are chemicals  wood  energy  labor  maintenance  and depreciation  amortization  and depletion 
costs for commodities  including chemicals  wood  and energy  are the most variable component of our cost of sales because their prices can fluctuate substantially  sometimes within a relatively short period of time 
in addition  our aggregate commodity purchases fluctuate based on the volume of paper that we produce 
chemicals 
chemicals utilized in the manufacturing of coated papers include latex  starch  calcium carbonate  and titanium dioxide 
we purchase these chemicals from a variety of suppliers and are not dependent on any single supplier to satisfy our chemical needs 
we expect imbalances in supply and demand to periodically create volatility in prices for certain chemicals 
wood 
our costs to purchase wood are affected directly by market costs of wood in our regional markets and indirectly by the effect of higher fuel costs on logging and transportation of timber to our facilities 
while we have in place fiber supply agreements that ensure a substantial portion of our wood requirements  purchases under these agreements are typically at market rates 
energy 
we produce a large portion of our energy requirements  historically producing approximately of our energy needs for our coated paper mills from sources such as waste wood and paper  hydroelectric facilities  chemicals from our pulping process  our own steam recovery boilers and internal energy cogeneration facilities 
our external energy purchases vary across each of our mills and include fuel oil  natural gas  coal  and electricity 
while our internal energy production capacity mitigates the volatility of our overall energy expenditures  we expect prices for energy to remain volatile for the foreseeable future and our energy costs to increase in a high energy cost environment 
as prices fluctuate  we have some ability to switch between certain energy sources in order to minimize costs 
we utilize derivative contracts as part of our risk management strategy to manage our exposure to market fluctuations in energy prices 
in january  we completed a million renewable energy project at our mill in quinnesec  michigan 
the project is delivering megawatts of additional green energy for consumption within the mill  which is equivalent to the amount of electricity consumed by  homes in a year 
labor 
labor costs include wages  salary  and benefit expenses attributable to our mill personnel 
mill employees at a non managerial level are compensated on an hourly basis 
management employees at our mills are compensated on a salaried basis 
wages  salary  and benefit expenses included in cost of sales do not vary significantly over the short term 
in addition  we have not experienced significant labor shortages 
maintenance 
maintenance expense includes day to day maintenance  equipment repairs  and larger maintenance projects  such as paper machine shutdowns for periodic maintenance 
day to day maintenance expenses have not varied significantly from year to year 
larger maintenance projects and equipment expenses can produce year to year fluctuations in our maintenance expenses 
in conjunction with our periodic maintenance shutdowns  we have incidental incremental costs that are primarily comprised of unabsorbed fixed costs from lower production volumes and other incremental costs for purchased materials and energy that would otherwise be produced as part of the normal operation of our mills 
depreciation  amortization  and depletion 
depreciation  amortization  and depletion expense represents the periodic charge to earnings through which the cost of tangible assets  intangible assets  and natural resources are recognized over the asset s life 
capital investments can increase our asset bases and produce year to year fluctuations in expense 
selling  general  and administrative expenses the principal components of our selling  general  and administrative expenses are wages  salaries  and benefits for our office personnel at our headquarters and our sales force  travel and entertainment expenses  advertising expenses  expenses relating to certain information technology systems  and research and development expenses 
critical accounting policies our accounting policies are fundamental to understanding management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and follow general practices within the industry in which we operate 
the preparation of the financial statements requires management to make certain judgments and assumptions in determining accounting estimates 
accounting estimates are considered critical if the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made  and different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  that would have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
management believes the following critical accounting policies are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require subjective or complex judgments 
these judgments about critical accounting estimates are based on information available to us as of the date of the financial statements 
accounting standards whose application may have a significant effect on the reported results of operations and financial position  and that can require judgments by management that affect their application  include the following financial accounting standards board  or fasb  accounting standards codification  or asc  topic  contingencies  asc topic  property  plant  and equipment  asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other  and asc topic  compensation retirement benefits 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable  as measured by comparing their net book value to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows generated by their use 
goodwill and other intangible assets are accounted for in accordance with asc topic intangible assets primarily consist of trademarks  customer related intangible assets and patents obtained through business acquisitions 
we have identified the following trademarks as intangible assets with an indefinite life influence  liberty  and advocate 
we assess goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level and has been allocated to the coated segment 
we test goodwill for impairment by applying a two step test 
the first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  goodwill is considered impaired and the loss is measured by performing step two  which involves using a hypothetical purchase price allocation to determine the implied fair value of the goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the goodwill 
for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts  step two is required if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying amount of the goodwill 
during the fiscal quarter ended september   based on a combination of factors  including the difficult market conditions which have resulted in a decline in customer demand and excess capacity in the coated paper markets and high raw material  energy and distribution costs which have challenged the profitability of our products  we concluded that sufficient indicators existed to require us to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis as of september  based on verso paper s deficit equity position  we were required to perform step two of the fair value based goodwill impairment analysis 
due to the complexities of the step two analysis which involves an allocation of the fair value  management was unable to make a good faith estimate of the impairment during the third quarter of upon finalizing our analysis during the fourth quarter of  verso paper recognized a goodwill impairment charge of million and verso holdings recognized a goodwill impairment charge of million 
we have no goodwill remaining as of december  management believes that the accounting estimates associated with determining fair value as part of an impairment analysis are critical accounting estimates because estimates and assumptions are made about our future performance and cash flows 
the estimated fair value is generally determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows 
we also consider a market based approach and a combination of both 
while management uses the best information available to estimate future performance and cash flows  future adjustments to management s projections may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the estimates 
pension benefit obligations 
we offer various pension plans to employees 
the calculation of the obligations and related expenses under these plans requires the use of actuarial valuation methods and assumptions  including the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  discount rates  projected future compensation increases  health care cost trend rates and mortality rates 
actuarial valuations and assumptions used in the determination of future values of plan assets and liabilities are subject to management judgment and may differ significantly if different assumptions are used 
contingent liabilities 
a liability is contingent if the outcome or amount is not presently known  but may become known in the future as a result of the occurrence of some uncertain future event 
we estimate our contingent liabilities based on management s estimates about the probability of outcomes and their ability to estimate the range of exposure 
accounting standards require that a liability be recorded if management determines that it is probable that a loss has occurred and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
in addition  it must be probable that the loss will be confirmed by some future event 
as part of the estimation process  management is required to make assumptions about matters that are by their nature highly uncertain 
the assessment of contingent liabilities  including legal contingencies  asset retirement obligations and environmental costs and obligations  involves the use of critical estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
management s estimates are based on their belief that future events will validate the current assumptions regarding the ultimate outcome of these exposures 
however  there can be no assurance that future events will not differ from management s assessments 
recent accounting developments asc topic  comprehensive income 
accounting standards update  or asu  no 
 comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income  changes the existing guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income 
entities will have the option of presenting the components of net income and other comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
entities no longer have the option of presenting the components of other comprehensive income within the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
asu no 
is effective on a retrospective basis for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   which for us is the first quarter of in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued asu no 
 comprehensive income deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 
 which defers changes in asu no 
that related to the presentation of reclassification adjustments 
the adoption of the remaining guidance provided in asu no 
will result in a change to our current presentation of comprehensive income but will have no impact on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment  is intended to simplify goodwill impairment testing by adding a qualitative review step to assess whether the required quantitative impairment analysis that exists today is necessary 
under the new guidance  entities will not be required to calculate the fair value of a business that contains recorded goodwill unless it concludes  based on the qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of that business is less than its book value 
if such a decline in fair value is deemed more likely than not to have occurred  then the quantitative goodwill impairment test prescribed by current accounting principles must be completed  otherwise  goodwill is deemed to be not impaired and no further testing is required until the next annual test date or sooner if conditions or events before that date raise concerns of potential impairment in the business 
the amended goodwill impairment guidance does not affect the manner in which a company estimates fair value 
asu no 
is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed by us beginning january  earlier adoption is permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures 
asu no 
 fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss  provides clarifying guidance on how to measure fair value and additional disclosure requirements 
the update does not extend the use of fair value accounting  but does provide guidance on how it should be applied where it is already required or permitted under current us gaap 
asu no 
is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december   which for us is january   and will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
other new accounting pronouncements issued but not effective until after december   are not expected to have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 
financial overview in net sales increased  or million  as sales prices improved while sales volume decreased compared to the average sales price for all of our products increased compared to but began to level off by the end of as sales prices for the fourth quarter of decreased from the third quarter of sales volume was down in compared to  primarily due to lower sales volume during the first half of the year  while fourth quarter sales volume increased compared to the fourth quarter of and remained level with the seasonally strong third quarter of our gross margin increased to in from in  reflecting the increase in sales prices 
verso paper s adjusted ebitda before the pro forma effects of the profitability program was million in compared to million in note ebitda and adjusted ebitda are non gaap financial measures and are defined and reconciled to cash flows from operating activities later in this report 
ebitda adjustments excluding the pro forma effect of the profitability program of million in included restructuring charges of million  net losses of million related to the early retirement of debt in connection with our debt refinancing  goodwill impairment of million  and million of losses recognized due to the de designation of certain energy related derivative contracts 
ebitda adjustments excluding the pro forma effect of the profitability program of million in were primarily related to new product development 
in verso paper reported a net loss of million  or per diluted share  and operating income of million 
impacting the results for were the restructuring costs associated with the shutdown of three paper machines  losses related to debt refinancing  goodwill impairment  and unrealized losses on hedging transactions 
in verso paper reported a net loss of million  or per diluted share  and an operating loss of million 
during we permanently shut down the no 
coated groundwood paper machine at our mill in bucksport  maine  and two supercalendered paper machines at our mill in sartell  minnesota  thereby reducing our annual production capacity by  tons 
in conjunction with these closures  the bucksport mill s workforce was reduced by approximately employees and the sartell mill s workforce was reduced by approximately employees 
the paper machine shutdowns resulted in charges of million in the fourth quarter of  of which approximately million is expected to be cash expenditures in the first quarter of additionally  verso paper and verso holdings recognized goodwill impairment charges of million and million  respectively  which represent a write off of the full balance of goodwill 
we continue to develop and execute our renewable energy strategy 
all of our previously announced energy projects are on schedule and are expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of in january  we completed a million renewable energy project at our mill in quinnesec  michigan 
the project is delivering megawatts of additional green energy for consumption within the mill  which is equivalent to the amount of electricity consumed by  homes in a year 
we expect to realize a total positive annual ebitda impact of approximately million when all the projects are completed 
our capital expenditures increased to million in compared to million in  reflecting our investment in these projects 
approximately million of the capital expenditures in were funded from cash restricted for use on the quinnesec renewable energy project 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated financial information for the years ended december    and cost of sales in the following table and discussion includes the cost of products sold and depreciation  amortization  and depletion 
the following table and discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report

net sales for increased to  million from  million  as the average sales price for all of our products increased  reflecting price increases implemented during and at the beginning of the second quarter of this positive impact was partially offset by a decline in total sales volume during compared to net sales for our coated and supercalendered papers segment increased to  million in from  million in this improvement reflects a increase in the average paper sales price per ton in while paper sales volume decreased in compared to net sales for our market pulp segment decreased to million in from million in  reflecting a decrease in the average sales price per ton combined with a decrease in sales volume compared to net sales for our other segment increased to million in from million in the improvement in is due to a increase in the average sales price per ton combined with a increase in sales volume in compared to cost of sales 
cost of sales  including depreciation  amortization  and depletion  was  million in compared to  million in our gross margin  excluding depreciation  amortization  and depletion  was for compared to for  reflecting higher average sales prices during depreciation  amortization  and depletion expenses were million for  compared to million for selling  general  and administrative 
selling  general  and administrative expenses were million for both verso paper and verso holdings in compared to million and million  respectively  in  primarily due to inflation of personnel related costs and certain non recurring costs including professional fees and severance 
goodwill impairment 
in verso paper and verso holdings recognized goodwill impairment charges of million and million  respectively  which represent a write off of the full balance of goodwill 
restructuring and other charges 
restructuring and other charges of million in reflect the permanent shut down of the no 
coated groundwood paper machine at our mill in bucksport  maine  and two supercalendered paper machines at our mill in sartell  minnesota 
these charges include million of severance and benefit costs  million of accelerated depreciation  and million due to write off of spare parts and inventory

compared to net sales 
net sales for increased to  million from  million  as total sales volume increased compared to  reflecting improved economic conditions 
this increase was partially offset by a decline in the average sales price per ton for all of our products  primarily reflecting the decline of coated paper prices throughout and into early net sales for our coated and supercalendered papers segment increased to  million in from  million in this improvement reflects a increase in paper sales volume  while the average paper sales price per ton for decreased compared to net sales for our market pulp segment increased to million in from million in this increase was due to a increase in average sales price per ton combined with a increase in sales volume compared to net sales for our other segment increased to million in from million in the improvement in is due to a increase in sales volume  reflecting the development of new paper product offerings for our customers 
partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in the average sales price per ton compared to cost of sales 
cost of sales  including depreciation  amortization  and depletion  increased to  million in from  million in  primarily reflecting the increase in sales volume 
our gross margin  excluding depreciation  amortization  and depletion  was for compared to for  reflecting million of unabsorbed costs resulting from approximately  tons of market downtime  as we curtailed production in response to weak demand for coated papers in depreciation  amortization  and depletion expenses were million for  compared to million for selling  general  and administrative 
selling  general  and administrative expenses were million for verso paper and million for verso holdings in  up from million for verso paper and million for verso holdings in  mainly due to cost remediation efforts in associated with challenging economic conditions 
selling  general  and administrative expenses for reflect a return to more normal levels and are consistent with the amounts incurred in  excluding costs associated with our ipo 
interest expense 
interest expense for verso paper was million in compared to million in the increase in interest expense was primarily due to higher interest rates on outstanding debt in interest expense for verso holdings was million in compared to million in the increase in interest expense was primarily due to higher interest rates on outstanding debt in other income loss  net 
other income  net was million for verso paper and million for verso holdings in compared to million and million for verso paper and verso holdings  respectively  in included in the results for were million in net benefits from alternative fuel mixture tax credits provided by the us government for our use of black liquor in alternative fuel mixtures 
additionally  verso paper and verso holdings recognized million and million  respectively  in net gains related to the early retirement of debt 
reconciliation of cash flows from operating activities to adjusted ebitda ebitda consists of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization 
ebitda is a measure commonly used in our industry  and we present ebitda to enhance your understanding of our operating performance 
we use ebitda as one criterion for evaluating our performance relative to that of our peers 
we believe that ebitda is an operating performance measure  and not a liquidity measure  that provides investors and analysts with a measure of operating results unaffected by differences in capital structures  capital investment cycles  and ages of related assets among otherwise comparable companies 
adjusted ebitda is ebitda further adjusted to exclude unusual items and other pro forma adjustments permitted in calculating covenant compliance under the indentures governing our notes 
adjusted ebitda aligns the mark to market impact of economic hedge contracts used to hedge a portion of future natural gas purchases with the period in which they settle and reflects the amount of net cost savings projected to be realized as a result of specified activities taken during the preceding month period 
we believe that the inclusion of the supplemental adjustments applied in calculating adjusted ebitda are reasonable and appropriate to provide additional information to investors to demonstrate our compliance with our financial covenants 
we also believe that adjusted ebitda is a useful liquidity measurement tool for assessing our ability to meet our future debt service  capital expenditures  and working capital requirements 
however  ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not measurements of financial performance under us gaap  and our ebitda and adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
you should consider our ebitda and adjusted ebitda in addition to  and not as a substitute for or superior to  our operating or net income or cash flows from operating activities  determined in accordance with us gaap 
the following table reconciles cash flows from operating activities to ebitda and adjusted ebitda for the periods presented verso paper year ended december  dollars in millions cash flows from operating activities income tax expense amortization of debt issuance costs accretion of discount on long term debt loss gain on early extinguishment of debt  net goodwill impairment equity award expense interest income interest expense other  net changes in assets and liabilities  net ebitda alternative fuel tax credit loss gain on early extinguishment of debt  net goodwill impairment restructuring and other charges hedge losses equity award expense other items  net adjusted ebitda before pro forma effects of profitability program pro forma effects of profitability program adjusted ebitda represents earnings from thte federal government s program which provides incentives for the use of alternative fuels

restructuring includes transition and other non recurring costs associated with the acquisition as per our financial statements 
represents amortization of non cash incentive compensation 
represents earnings adjustments for product development costs and other miscellaneous non recurring items 
represents cost savings expected to be realized as part of our cost savings program 
seasonality we are exposed to fluctuations in quarterly net sales volumes and expenses due to seasonal factors 
these seasonal factors are common in the coated paper industry 
typically  the first two quarters are our slowest quarters due to lower demand for coated paper during this period 
our third quarter is generally our strongest quarter  reflecting an increase in printing related to end of year magazines  increased end of year direct mailings  and holiday season catalogs 
our working capital and accounts receivable generally peak in the third quarter  while inventory generally peaks in the second quarter in anticipation of the third quarter season 
we expect our seasonality trends to continue for the foreseeable future 
liquidity and capital resources we rely primarily upon cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility to finance operations  capital expenditures  and fluctuations in debt service requirements 
as of december   million was available for future borrowing under our revolving credit facility 
our current revolving credit facility matures in august  but we have obtained million of commitments for a new accounts receivable securitization facility and million of commitments to provide a new  and or extend our existing  revolving credit facility 
we believe that our ability to manage cash flow and working capital levels  particularly inventory and accounts payable  will allow us to meet our current and future obligations  pay scheduled principal and interest payments  and provide funds for working capital  capital expenditures  and other needs of the business for at least the next twelve months 
however  no assurance can be given that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available under our revolving credit facility including any replacement facilities in an amount sufficient to fund our liquidity needs 
as we focus on managing our expenses and cash flows  we continue to assess and implement  as appropriate  various earnings enhancement and expense reduction initiatives 
management has developed a company wide cost reduction program  which it expects to yield an additional million in cost reductions and continues to search for and develop additional cost savings measures 
verso paper s and verso holdings cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities  as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows  are summarized in the following table 
verso paper verso holdings year ended december  year ended december  dollars in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net change in cash and cash equivalents operating activities

on december   verso quinnesec rep llc  an indirect  wholly owned subsidiary of verso holdings  entered into a financing transaction with chase nmtc verso investment fund  llc  the investment fund  a consolidated variable interest entity 
under this arrangement  verso holdings loaned million to verso finance pursuant to a loan due december   and verso finance  in turn  loaned the funds on similar terms to the investment fund 
the investment fund then contributed the loan proceeds to certain community development entities  which  in turn  loaned the funds on similar terms to verso quinnesec rep llc  as partial financing for the renewable energy project at our mill in quinnesec  michigan 
as a holding company  verso paper s investments in its operating subsidiaries constitute substantially all of its operating assets 
consequently  verso paper s subsidiaries conduct all of its consolidated operations and own substantially all of its operating assets 
verso paper s principal source of the cash it needs to pay its debts is the cash that its subsidiaries generate from their operations and their borrowings 
verso paper s subsidiaries are not obligated to make funds available to it 
the terms of the revolving credit facility and the indentures governing the outstanding notes of verso paper s subsidiaries significantly restrict its subsidiaries from paying dividends and otherwise transferring assets to verso paper 
furthermore  verso paper s subsidiaries are permitted under the terms of the revolving credit facility and the indentures to incur additional indebtedness that may severely restrict or prohibit the making of distributions  the payment of dividends  or the making of loans by such subsidiaries to verso paper 
although the terms of the debt agreements of verso paper s subsidiaries do not restrict its operating subsidiaries from obtaining funds from their respective subsidiaries to fund their operations and payments on indebtedness  there can be no assurance that the agreements governing the current and future indebtedness of its subsidiaries will permit its subsidiaries to provide verso paper with sufficient dividends  distributions or loans to fund its obligations or pay dividends to its stockholders 
we may elect to retire our outstanding debt in open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions  or otherwise 
these repurchases may be funded through available cash from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
such repurchases are dependent on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions  and other factors 
covenant compliance the credit agreement and the indentures governing our notes contain affirmative covenants as well as restrictive covenants which limit our ability to  among other things  incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends or make other distributions  repurchase or redeem our stock  make investments  sell assets  including capital stock of restricted subsidiaries  enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends  consolidate  merge  sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets  enter into transactions with our affiliates  and incur liens 
these covenants can result in limiting our long term growth prospects by hindering our ability to incur future indebtedness or grow through acquisitions 
as of december   we were in compliance in all material respects with the covenants in our debt agreements 
effect of inflation while inflationary increases in certain input costs  such as for energy  wood fiber  and chemicals  have an impact on our operating results  changes in general inflation have had minimal impact on our operating results in the last three years 
sales prices and volumes are more strongly influenced by supply and demand factors in specific markets and by exchange rate fluctuations than by inflationary factors 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will not be affected by general inflation in the future

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in our paper prices  interest rates  energy prices  and commodity prices for our inputs 
paper prices our sales  which we report net of rebates  allowances  and discounts  are a function of the number of tons of paper that we sell and the price at which we sell our paper 
the coated paper industry is cyclical  which results in changes in both volume and price 
paper prices historically have been a function of macro economic factors  which influence supply and demand 
price has historically been substantially more variable than volume and can change significantly over relatively short time periods 
we are primarily focused on serving two end user segments catalogs and magazines 
coated paper demand is primarily driven by advertising and print media usage 
advertising spending and magazine and catalog circulation tend to correlate with gdp in the united states they rise with a strong economy and contract with a weak economy 
many of our customers provide us with forecasts of their paper needs  which allows us to plan our production runs in advance  optimizing production over our integrated mill system and thereby reducing costs and increasing overall efficiency 
generally  our sales agreements do not extend beyond the calendar year 
typically  our sales agreements provide for quarterly price adjustments based on market price movements 
we reach our end users through several channels  including printers  brokers  paper merchants  and direct sales to end users 
we sell and market our products to approximately customers 
in  quad graphics  inc and xpedx  and their respective affiliates  accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our total net sales 
interest rates we have issued fixed and floating rate debt in order to manage our variability to cash flows from interest rates 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility  the second priority senior secured floating rate notes  and verso finance s senior unsecured term loan accrue interest at variable rates  however  there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility as of december  a basis point increase in quoted interest rates on verso paper s outstanding floating rate debt as of december   would increase annual interest expense by million of which million is attributable to verso finance s senior unsecured term loan on which we have elected to pay interest in kind 
a basis point increase in quoted interest rates on verso holdings outstanding floating rate notes as of december   would increase annual interest expense by million 
while we may enter into agreements limiting our exposure to higher interest rates  any such agreements may not offer complete protection from this risk 
derivatives in the normal course of business  we utilize derivatives contracts as part of our risk management strategy to manage our exposure to market fluctuations in energy prices and interest rates 
these instruments are subject to credit and market risks in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
controls and monitoring procedures for these instruments have been established and are routinely reevaluated 
we have an energy risk management policy which was adopted by our board of directors and is monitored by an energy risk management committee composed of our senior management 
in addition  we have an interest rate risk committee which was formed to monitor our interest rate risk management policy 
credit risk represents the potential loss that may occur because a party to a transaction fails to perform according to the terms of the contract 
the measure of credit exposure is the replacement cost of contracts with a positive fair value 
we manage credit risk by entering into financial instrument transactions only through approved counterparties 
market risk represents the potential loss due to the decrease in the value of a financial instrument caused primarily by changes in commodity prices or interest rates 
we manage market risk by establishing and monitoring limits on the types and degree of risk that may be undertaken 
we do not hedge the entire exposure of our operations from commodity price volatility for a variety of reasons 
to the extent that we do not hedge against commodity price volatility  our results of operations may be affected either favorably or unfavorably by a shift in the future price curve 
as of december   we had net unrealized losses of million on open commodity contracts with maturities of one to twenty three months 
these derivative instruments involve the exchange of net cash settlements  based on changes in the price of the underlying commodity index compared to the fixed price offering  at specified intervals without the exchange of any underlying principal 
a decrease in commodity prices would have a negative impact of approximately million on the fair value of such instruments 
this quantification of exposure to market risk does not take into account the offsetting impact of changes in prices on anticipated future energy purchases 
commodity prices we are subject to changes in our cost of sales caused by movements underlying commodity prices 
the principal components of our cost of sales are chemicals  wood  energy  labor  maintenance  and depreciation  amortization  and depletion 
costs for commodities  including chemicals  wood and energy  are the most variable component of our cost of sales because their prices can fluctuate substantially  sometimes within a relatively short period of time 
in addition  our aggregate commodity purchases fluctuate based on the volume of paper that we produce 
chemicals 
chemicals utilized in the manufacturing of coated papers include latex  starch  calcium carbonate  and titanium dioxide 
we purchase these chemicals from a variety of suppliers and are not dependent on any single supplier to satisfy our chemical needs 
we expect imbalances in supply and demand to periodically create volatility in prices for certain chemicals 
wood 
our costs to purchase wood are affected directly by market costs of wood in our regional markets and indirectly by the effect of higher fuel costs on logging and transportation of timber to our facilities 
while we have in place fiber supply agreements that ensure a substantial portion of our wood requirements  purchases under these agreements are typically at market rates 
energy 
we produce a large portion of our energy requirements  historically producing approximately of our energy needs for our coated paper mills from sources such as waste wood and paper  hydroelectric facilities  chemicals from our pulping process  our own steam recovery boilers  and internal energy cogeneration facilities 
our external energy purchases vary across each of our mills and include fuel oil  natural gas  coal  and electricity 
while our internal energy production capacity mitigates the volatility of our overall energy expenditures  we expect prices for energy to remain volatile for the foreseeable future and our energy costs to increase in a high energy cost environment 
as prices fluctuate  we have some ability to switch between certain energy sources in order to minimize costs 
we utilize derivatives contracts as part of our risk management strategy to manage our exposure to market fluctuations in energy prices
