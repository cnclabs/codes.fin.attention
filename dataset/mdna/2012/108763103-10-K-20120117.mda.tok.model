management believes that our strong financial position and our capital resources are sufficient to provide for our operating needs and capital expenditures for fiscal impact of inflation our operating results are heavily dependent upon the prices paid for raw materials 
the marketing of our value added products does not lend itself to instantaneous changes in selling prices 
changes in selling prices are relatively infrequent and do not compare with the volatility of commodity markets 
while fluctuations in significant cost structure components  such as ingredient commodities and fuel prices  have had a significant impact on profitability over the last two fiscal years  the impact of general price inflation on our financial position and results of operations has not been significant 
however  future volatility of general price inflation or deflation and raw material cost and availability could adversely affect our financial results 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have any off balance sheet arrangements within the meaning of item a of regulation s k 
contractual obligations we have remained free of interest bearing debt for twenty five consecutive years and had no other debt or other contractual obligations at october  critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
amounts estimated related to liabilities for self insured workers compensation  employee healthcare and pension benefits are especially subject to inherent uncertainties and these estimated liabilities may ultimately settle at amounts not originally estimated 
we record promotional and returns allowances and bad debt allowances based on recent and historical trends 
management believes its current estimates are reasonable and based on the best information available at the time
