item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview lufkin industries  inc the company is a global supplier of oilfield and power transmission products 
through its oilfield segment  the company manufactures and services artificial lift equipment and related products  which are used to extract crude oil and other fluids from wells 
through its power transmission segment  the company manufactures and services high speed and low speed increasing and reducing gearboxes for energy and industrial applications 
while these markets are price competitive  technological and quality differences can provide product differentiation 
the company s objective is to extend its position as a leading global supplier of high quality  mission critical artificial lift and power transmission products  and related aftermarket services 
the company intends to accomplish its objective and capitalize on long term industry growth trends through the execution of the following strategies position the company as the preferred source for artificial lift solutions 
the company believes it offers one of the industry s broadest portfolios of artificial lift products  including reciprocating rod  gas  plunger and hydraulic lift equipment  pcps  and measurement and control equipment for all types of artificial lift  including esps 
the company has developed a specialized optimization team which focuses on assisting producers with well completion design and production management 
the company is integrating its portfolio of artificial lift products  automation technologies  global service team and optimization team to deliver complete artificial lift solutions to its customers 
the company believes that the combination of its more than years of artificial lift experience and its optimization expertise will allow its customers to offset the diminishing artificial lift knowledge base in their organizations 
continue to expand the company s global reach 
the company intends to continue to expand its global reach by establishing manufacturing  engineering and service platforms on three continents  which will in turn support a network of regional service centers in areas with high actual or potential demand for artificial lift solutions 
these platforms include o lufkin  texas  which supports its operations in the united states and canada  o comodoro rivadavia  argentina  which supports its operations in south america  o ploiesti  romania and eastern france  which support or will support the company s operations in europe  the middle east  north africa and elsewhere in the eastern hemisphere 
k the company also plans to exploit new market opportunities by deploying sales  distribution  service and manufacturing resources in markets where it believes it is currently under represented 
the company believes that this strategy has already strengthened its customer relationships and that further expansion will allow it to respond more quickly to its customers needs 
the company also expects that a broad geographical footprint will improve its support logistics and reduce its costs 
expand the company s portfolio of artificial lift products and solutions through acquisitions and internal development 
the company intends to continue to selectively pursue acquisitions that increase its exposure to the most important growth trends in the industry  fill critical product gaps and expand its geographic scope 
since the beginning of the company has successfully acquired and integrated several businesses across both its segments  including pentagon and quinn s reciprocating down hole pump and pcp businesses 
in  the company completed the acquisitions of datac and realflex and announced its pending acquisition of zenith 
the company believes these transactions demonstrate its ability to identify and complete strategic transactions that are consistent with its long term strategy 
develop the next generation of automation solutions 
as producers increasingly focus on maximizing the production from existing wells and deploy their capital resources in newer  unconventional plays where reservoir pressures deplete more rapidly  the company is developing the technologies that will allow its customers to automatically control surface and down hole pumps  based on real time temperature  pressure and flow data  to optimize artificial lift performance across a variety of well conditions  thereby maximizing recovery rates 
the company s optimization team provides expertise to help producers design full field optimization programs in order to produce their reserves at a lower cost and with greater reliability 
this expertise includes the selection of the appropriate artificial lift and automation technology  facility layout and field electrification 
as automation technology evolves  the company intends to take advantage of opportunities to retrofit existing equipment and then provide its customers with ongoing upgrades 
trends outlook the company s business is largely dependent on the level of capital expenditures in the energy industry  which affects the drilling of new wells  the use of artificial lift technologies to improve the recovery from existing wells and the construction of new energy infrastructure 
the company believes the significant trends impacting its industry include the following world oil and natural gas consumption continues to increase  driven by growing economies in emerging markets  growing economies are creating the need for large scale energy infrastructure projects  such as refineries and lng facilities  and natural gas is gaining market share as a source of fuel for power generation 
in addition  the following trends are influencing demand for artificial lift solutions producers are increasingly focused on optimizing the ultimate recoveries from mature oilfields  such as the permian basin in west texas and in central california  north american exploration and production activity is shifting toward unconventional plays such as the bakken and eagle ford shale formations  which often require some form of artificial lift earlier in the production life of the well than production from a conventional reservoir does 
this trend towards shale exploration is expected to spread globally in coming years  and producers are facing a shortage of experienced personnel due to retirements  and are increasingly relying on outside expertise 
we believe the outlook for the global energy industry is favorable 
according to the eia  oil was the single most significant component of world energy consumption in  representing of total demand 
forecasts published by the eia anticipate that worldwide demand for oil will grow from million barrels per day in to million barrels per day in k as more readily accessible oil reserves are depleted  producers have been required to make increasing investments in order to maintain their production and increase their reserves to meet the growing demand for energy resources worldwide 
as a result  many producers are focused on extending the ultimate recovery from existing producing wells  through enhanced oil recovery methods such as infill drilling  co injection and artificial lift  as a profitable alternative to finding and developing new reservoirs 
the benefits of enchanced oil recovery can be dramatic 
for example  according to bp  the average recovery factor for a typical oil reservoir is only  and a increase in the average recovery factor for all reservoirs would add an estimated to billion additional barrels of oil to the global reserve pool  an amount equal to the total reserves that have been attributable to all discoveries over the last years 
in their search for new reserves  oil and gas producers are increasingly turning to unconventional reservoirs such as shale formations 
due to their geologic characteristics  shale reservoirs have a natural pressure that typically declines more rapidly than a conventional reservoir s 
as a result  the company expects that current trends in shale development will result in increased demand for artificial lift solutions worldwide 
according to spears  the global artificial lift market was approximately billion in and grew at an average annual rate of between and international sales accounted for more than of the total worldwide market for artificial lift in  according to spears  and the company expects international sales to continue to comprise a significant portion of the global artificial lift market going forward 
the power transmission segment also benefits from many of these industry trends 
approximately two thirds of the products the company sells in this segment are for applications in the oil and gas  refining and power generation industries 
the company believes growing global populations and energy consumption will create increased demand for energy infrastructure  and with it increased demand for custom engineered  mission critical gearboxes 
the company also believes that the combination of engineering knowledge  specialized machine tools  mechanical test capabilities and reliability that is required in the power transmission industry constitute a significant barrier to entry to potential new competitors and limit the competitive landscape to a relatively small number of suppliers

pension expense  which is reported as a component of cost of sales  decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease in expense was primarily due to the impact of favorable demographic trends 
the net tax rate for the year ended december   was  compared to for the year ended december  the net tax rate in benefitted from adjustments to prior period tax filings in the united states related to changes in tax laws 
k liquidity and capital resources the company has historically relied on cash flows from operations and third party borrowings to finance its operations  including acquisitions  dividend payments and stock repurchases 
the company believes that its cash flows from operations and its available borrowing capacity under its credit agreements will be sufficient to fund its operations  including planned capital expenditures  business combinations  debt repayments and dividend payments  through december   and the foreseeable future 
the company s cash balance totaled million at december   compared to million at december  for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million  net cash used in investing activities totaled million and net cash provided by financing activities amounted to million 
significant components of cash provided by operating activities included net earnings from continuing operations  adjusted for non cash expenses  of million  partially offset by an increase in working capital of million 
this working capital increase was primarily due to an increase in trade receivables and inventory balances of million and million  respectively  due to increased sales volumes during  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million 
net cash used in investing activities included net capital expenditures totaling million and the pentagon and quinn s acquisitions totaling million 
capital expenditures in were primarily for new facilities to support geographical and product line expansions in the oilfield and power transmission segments 
capital expenditures for  which will be funded by operating cash flows  are projected to increase over spending levels  primarily for the new romanian manufacturing facility  other new manufacturing and service facilities to support geographical and product line expansions and equipment replacement for efficiency improvements in the oilfield and power transmission segments 
significant components of net cash provided by financing activities included term loan borrowings of million and dividend payments of million  or per share 
proceeds from stock option exercises of million partially offset financing cash outflows 
the company has a five year secured credit facility with a group of lenders the bank facility consisting of a revolving line of credit that provides up to million of aggregate borrowing and a million term loan 
under the bank facility the company has granted a first priority lien  security interest and collateral assignment of substantially all of its current assets 
the bank facility matures on november  borrowings under the bank facility bear interest  at the company s option  at either a the highest of i the prime rate  ii the federal funds effective rate plus  and iii the adjusted libo rate for an interest period of one month plus  in each case plus an applicable margin based on the company s leverage ratio or b the interest rate equal to i the rate for us dollar deposits in the london interbank market for such interest period multiplied by ii the statutory reserve rate  plus iii the applicable margin 
throughout the term of the bank facility  the company pays an unused commitment fee which ranges from percent to percent based on the company s leverage ratio 
as of december   all million of the term loan was outstanding and there was million in letters of credit outstanding against the revolving credit facility 
as of december  the interest rate was on the credit facility and the company paid million of interest expense in the year ended december  the carrying value of debt is not materially different from its fair value 
the company was in compliance with all financial covenants under the bank facility as of december  and had borrowing capacity of million 
on february   the company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire zenith for million in cash  net of acquired cash 
the parties have agreed that the transaction will close on february  to fund this acquisition  the company drew million from the revolving credit facility 
combined with a draw of million in january from the revolving credit facility to fund general working capital requirements  approximately million is remaining available from the revolving credit facility at february  on february   the company entered into a new short term credit agreement in order to obtain a million delayed draw temporary term loan to enhance its short term liquidity 
amounts borrowed under the delayed draw temporary term loan will be utilized  if necessary  for liquidity purposes 
as of february   no amount was drawn on this delayed draw temporary loan 
also  on february   the company entered into an amendment to its second amended and restated credit agreement 
among other things  the amendment i allowed the company to enter a definitive agreement to acquire zenith  ii allowed the company to enter into its new short term credit agreement mentioned above and iii modified the prepayment provisions in its second amended and restated credit agreement 
the company may explore other longer term financing opportunities to reduce the borrowings under the delayed draw temporary loan and the revolving credit facility 
the following table summarizes the company s expected cash outflows from financial contracts and commitments as of december  information on recurring purchases of materials for use in manufacturing and service operations has not been included 
these amounts are not long term in nature less than six months and are generally consistent from year to year 
k in thousands of dollars payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations debt obligations interest expense contractual commitments for capital expenditures total since the company has no significant tax loss carry forwards  the company expects to make quarterly estimated tax payments in based on taxable income levels 
also  the company has various qualified retirement plans for which the company has committed a certain level of benefit 
the company expects to make contributions to its pension plans of million and to its post retirement health and life plans of approximately million in contribution levels to these plans after will depend on participation in the plans  possible plan changes  discount rates and actual rates of return on plan assets 
as discussed in note business segment information in the notes to consolidated financial statements  set forth in part ii  item of this form k  the consolidated balance sheet at december  includes approximately million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions in the jurisdictions in which the company conducts business 
due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations  combined with the difficulty in predicting when tax audits throughout the world may be concluded  lufkin cannot make reliable estimates of the timing of cash outflows relating to these liabilities 
off balance sheet arrangements none 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force asu  which changes the accounting for certain revenue arrangements 
the new requirements change the allocation methods used in determining how to account for multiple payment streams and will result in the ability to separately account for more deliverables  and potentially less revenue deferrals 
additionally  asu requires enhanced disclosures in financial statements 
asu is effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning after june  on a prospective basis  with early application permitted 
the company adopted asu on january  the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on the balance sheet  statement of earnings  or statement of cash flow 
in june  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income asu  which changes the presentation of comprehensive income 
the topic requires the company to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements  which differs from our current presentation within the statement of stockholders equity 
asu is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   with early application permitted 
upon adoption  the requirements under asu will be retrospectively applied 
in december  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income topic deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 
which defers only those changes in asu that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments 
in september  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment asu  which simplifies how entities test for goodwill impairment 
the topic allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
under asu  an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
asu includes a number of events and circumstances for an entity to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment 
asu is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december   with early application permitted 
the requirements under this asu  once adopted  will be applied prospectively 
k management believes the impact of other recently issued standards  which are not yet effective  will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements upon adoption 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis  based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated statements 
the company extends credit to customers in the normal course of business 
management performs ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness 
an allowance for doubtful accounts has been established to provide for estimated losses on receivable collections 
the balance of this allowance is determined by regular reviews of outstanding receivables and historical experience 
as the financial condition of customers change  circumstances develop or additional information becomes available  adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required 
revenue is not recognized until it is realized or realizable and earned 
the criteria to meet this guideline are persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
in some cases  a customer is not able to take delivery of a completed product and requests that the company store the product for a defined period of time 
the company will process a bill and hold invoice and recognize revenue at the time of the storage request if all of the following criteria are met the customer has accepted title and risk of loss  the customer has provided a written purchase order for the product  the customer  not the company  requested the product to be stored and to be invoiced under a bill and hold arrangement 
the customer must also provide the business purpose for the storage request  the customer must provide a storage period and future shipping date  the company must not have retained any future performance obligations on the product  the company must segregate the stored product and not make it available to use on other orders  and the product must be completed and ready for shipment 
the company has made significant investments in inventory to service its customers 
on a routine basis  the company uses estimates in determining the level of reserves required to state inventory at the lower of cost or market 
management s estimates are primarily influenced by market activity levels  production requirements  the physical condition of products and technological innovation 
changes in any of these factors may result in adjustments to the carrying value of inventory 
also  the company accounts for a significant portion of its inventory under the last in  first out lifo method 
the lifo reserve can be impacted by changes in the lifo layers and by inflation index adjustments 
generally  annual increases in the inflation rate or the first in  first out fifo value of inventory cause the value of the lifo reserve to increase 
long lived assets held and used by the company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company assesses the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value can be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows  based on expected future operating results 
future adverse market conditions or poor operating results could result in the inability to recover the current carrying value and thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
goodwill acquired in connection with business combinations represent the excess of consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired 
the company performs impairment tests on the carrying value of goodwill at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be greater than fair value  such as significant underperformance relative to historical or projected operating results and significant negative industry or economic trends 
the company s fair value is primarily determined using discounted cash flows  which requires management to make judgments about future operating results  working capital requirements and capital spending levels 
changes in cash flow assumptions or other factors which negatively impact the fair value of the operations would influence the evaluation and may result in a determination that goodwill is impaired and a corresponding impairment charge 
k the application of income tax law is inherently complex 
the company is required to determine if an income tax position meets the criteria of more likely than not to be realized based on the merits of the position under tax laws  in order to recognize an income tax benefit 
this requires the company to make many assumptions and judgments regarding merits of income tax positions and the application of income tax law 
additionally  if a tax position meets the recognition criteria of more likely than not  the company is required to make judgments and assumptions to measure the amount of the tax benefits to recognize based on the probability of the amount of tax benefits that would be realized if the tax position was challenged by the taxing authorities 
interpretations and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time 
as a consequence  changes in assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the differences between the book basis and tax basis of the net assets of the company 
in providing for deferred taxes  management considers current tax regulations  estimates of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
changes in state  federal and foreign tax laws as well as changes in the financial position of the company could also affect the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
if management estimates that it is more likely than not that some or all of any deferred tax assets will expire before realization or that the future deductibility may not occur  a valuation allowance would be recorded 
the company is subject to claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of business 
the company maintains insurance coverage for various aspects of its businesses and operations 
the company retains a portion of the insured losses that occur through the use of deductibles 
management regularly reviews estimates of reported and unreported insured and non insured claims and legal actions and provides for losses through reserves 
as circumstances develop and additional information becomes available  adjustments to loss reserves may be required 
the company sells certain of its products to customers with a product warranty that provides repairs at no cost to the customer or the issuance of credit to the customer 
the length of the warranty term depends on the product being sold  but ranges from one year to five years 
the company accrues its estimated exposure to warranty claims based upon historical warranty claim costs as a percentage of sales multiplied by prior sales still under warranty at the end of any period 
management reviews these estimates on a regular basis and adjusts the warranty provisions as actual experience differs from historical estimates or other information becomes available 
the company offers defined benefit plans and other benefits upon the retirement of its employees 
assets and liabilities associated with these benefits are calculated by third party actuaries under the rules provided by various accounting standards  with certain estimates provided by management 
these estimates include the discount rate  expected rate of return of assets and the rate of increase of compensation and health claims 
on a regular basis  management reviews these estimates by comparing them to actual experience and those used by other companies 
if a change in an estimate is made  the carrying value of these assets and liabilities may have to be adjusted 
assuming all other variables held constant  differences in the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets within reasonably likely ranges would have had the following estimated impact on results thousands of dollars pension benefits other benefits discount rate effect of change on net periodic benefit cost income

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s financial instruments include cash  accounts receivable  accounts payable  invested funds and debt obligations 
the book value of accounts receivable  short term debt and accounts payable are considered to be representative of their fair market value because of the short maturity of these instruments 
while the company s accounts receivable are concentrated with customers in the energy industry  the company performs credit evaluations on current and potential customers and adjusts credit limits as appropriate 
in certain circumstances  the company will obtain collateral to mitigate higher credit risk 
the company does not utilize financial or derivative instruments for trading purposes or to hedge exposures to interest rates  foreign currency rates or commodity prices 
in addition  the company primarily invoices and purchases in the same currency as the functional currency of its operations  which minimizes exposure to currency rate fluctuations 
the company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations on its credit facility of million 
as of december   if the interest rate increased by 
points the net income impact would be million of expense 
k the company uses large amounts of steel  iron and electricity in the manufacture of its products 
the prices of these raw materials have a significant impact on the cost of producing products 
steel and electricity prices have increased significantly in the last five years  caused primarily by higher energy prices and increased global demand 
since the company does not enter into long term contracts with most of its suppliers  the company is vulnerable to fluctuations in prices of such raw materials 
factors such as supply and demand  freight costs and transportation availability  inventory levels of brokers and dealers  the level of imports and general economic conditions may affect the price of cast iron and steel 
raw material prices may increase significantly in the future 
certain items such as steel round and bearings have continued to experience price increases  price volatility and longer lead times 
if the company is unable to pass future raw material price increases on to its customers  margins  results of operations  cash flow and financial condition could be adversely affected
