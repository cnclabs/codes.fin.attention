during fiscal year  at t and spiral solutions and technologies each accounted for more than of that segment s revenues 
the loss by the company of any one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company believes its relationship with these companies to be mutually satisfactory and is not aware of any prospect for the cancellation or significant reduction of any of its commercial or existing us government contracts 
the company purchases a variety of components such as transistors  resistors  capacitors  connectors and diodes for use in the manufacture of its products 
the company is not dependent upon any one supplier or source of supply for any of its component part purchases and maintains alternative sources of supply for all of its purchased components 
the company has found its suppliers generally to be reliable and price competitive 
research and development the company s technological leadership continues to be an important factor to support future growth in revenues and earnings 
the company has focused its internal research and development efforts on improving the core physics and electronic packages in its time and frequency products  conducting research to develop new time and frequency technologies  improving product manufacturability by seeking to reduce its production costs through product redesign and process improvements and other measures to take advantage of lower cost components

during fiscal years and  the company expended million and million of its own funds  respectively  on such research and development activity 
see also item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
during fiscal years and  many of the company s development resources were applied to certain cost plus fee contracts and the design stage of fixed price satellite payload programs 
as a result  some of the company s development efforts were customer funded and the costs appear in cost of revenues resulting in reduced internal research and development spending 
for fiscal year  the company is targeting to spend between million and million on internal research and development projects 
the actual amount spent in fiscal year will depend on market conditions and identification of new opportunities 
patents and licenses the company believes that its business is generally not dependent on patent or license protection 
rather  it is primarily dependent upon the company s technical competence  the quality of its products and its prompt and responsible contract performance 
however  employees working for the company assign all rights to inventions to the company and the company presently holds such patents and licenses 
in certain limited circumstances  the us government may use or permit the use by the company s competitors of certain patents or licenses the government has funded 
during fiscal year  the company received a broad and significant patent for new  proprietary quartz oscillator technology which the company intends to exploit in both legacy and new applications 
in  the company obtained a basic patent for its low g sensitivity technology which management believes will permit greatly enhanced performance of devices on moving platforms and under externally imposed shock or vibration 
competition the company experiences competition in all areas of its business 
the company competes primarily on the basis of the accuracy  performance and reliability of its products  the ability of its products to function under severe conditions  in space or in extreme hostile environments  prompt and responsive contract performance  technical competence and price 
the company has a unique and broad product line which includes quartz  rubidium  and cesium based timing references and specialized rf microwave technology 
because of its primary focus on very high precision products  the company has few competitors 
for lower precision components there are a significant number of suppliers and the company generally elects not to compete 
the company s principal competition for space products is the in house capability of its major customers and a limited number of other firms capable of providing high reliability microwave frequency generators 
with respect to its instruments and systems for timing and synchronization  the company competes with agilent technologies  symmetricom  inc  e 
g 
and g  inc  vectron  inc

factors that would cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  inability to integrate operations and personnel  actions by significant customers or competitors  general domestic and international economic conditions  consumer spending trends  reliance on key customers  continued acceptance of the company s products in the marketplace  competitive factors  new products and technological changes  product prices and raw material costs  dependence upon third party vendors  competitive developments  changes in manufacturing and transportation costs  the availability of capital  and the outcome of any litigation and arbitration proceedings 
the factors listed above are not exhaustive 
other sections of this k include additional factors that could materially and adversely impact the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  the company operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment 
new factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict the impact of all these factors on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
given these risks and uncertainties  investors should not rely on forward looking statements as a prediction of actual results 
any or all of the forward looking statements contained in this k and any other public statement made by the company or its management may turn out to be incorrect 
the company expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes its most critical accounting policies to be the recognition of revenue and costs on production contracts and the valuation of inventory 
each of these areas requires the company to make use of reasonable estimates including estimating the cost to complete a contract  the realizable value of its inventory or the market value of its products 
changes in estimates can have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
revenue recognition revenues under larger  long term contracts which generally require billings based on achievement of milestones rather than delivery of product  are reported in operating results using the percentage of completion method 
on fixed price contracts  which are typical for commercial and us government satellite programs and other long term us government projects  and which require initial design and development of the product  revenue is recognized on the cost to cost method 
under this method  revenue is recorded based upon the ratio that incurred costs bear to total estimated contract costs with related cost of sales recorded as the costs are incurred 
each month management reviews estimated contract costs through a process of aggregating actual costs incurred and estimating additional costs to completion based upon the current available information and status of the contract 
the effect of any change in the estimated gross margin percentage for a contract is reflected in revenues in the period in which the change is known 
provisions for anticipated losses on contracts are made in the period in which they become determinable 
on production type orders  revenue is recorded as units are delivered with the related cost of sales recognized on each shipment based upon a percentage of estimated final program costs 
changes in job performance on long term contracts and production type orders may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which revisions are determined to be required 
provisions for anticipated losses on customer orders are made in the period in which they become determinable 
for customer orders in the company s gillam fei and fei zyfer segments or smaller contracts or orders in the fei ny segment  sales of products and services to customers are reported in operating results based upon i shipment of the product or ii performance of the services pursuant to terms of the customer order 
when payment is contingent upon customer acceptance of the installed system  revenue is deferred until such acceptance is received and installation completed 
costs and expenses contract costs include all direct material  direct labor costs  manufacturing overhead and other direct costs related to contract performance 
selling  general and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred 
inventory in accordance with industry practice  inventoried costs contain amounts relating to contracts and programs with long production cycles  a portion of which will not be realized within one year 
inventory write downs are established for slow moving and obsolete items and are based upon management s experience and expectations for future business 
any changes arising from revised expectations are reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
marketable securities all of the company s investments in marketable securities are level securities which trade on public markets and have current prices that are readily available 
in general  investments in fixed price securities are only in the commercial paper of financially sound corporations or the bonds of us government agencies 
although the value of such investments may fluctuate significantly based on economic factors  the company s own financial strength enables it to wait for the securities to either recover their value or to mature such that any interim unrealized gains or losses are deemed to be temporary 
results of operations significant matters acquisition of elcom and reduction in deferred tax valuation allowance acquisition of fei elcom tech inc during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company completed the purchase of all remaining capital stock of elcom technologies  inc elcom or  after the acquisition  fei elcom that it did not previously own  resulting in ownership 
prior to this transaction  the company held a minority interest in elcom 
see note to the accompanying financial statements 
this transaction is a step acquisition under generally accepted accounting principles 
such an acquisition required the company to remeasure its previously held interest in elcom to fair value 
the difference between the fair value of elcom and the company s carrying value of its investment resulted in the recognition of a gain of approximately  this gain partially offset previously recorded impairment charges and equity losses in elcom incurred during fiscal year prior to the acquisition  fei elcom s fiscal year fourth quarter operating loss and costs incurred by the company in acquiring elcom 
for fiscal year  these elcom related transactions reduced the company s consolidated pretax income by approximately million 
the company anticipates that fei elcom tech will make a positive contribution to fiscal year profits 
reduction of deferred tax asset valuation allowance during the fourth quarters of fiscal years and  the company reduced its valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in the amount of million and million  respectively 
this recognition was the result of a review of all available evidence as required by generally accepted accounting principles in the us  including the negative evidence of cumulative losses in prior years which required the recording of a substantial valuation allowance in fiscal year management of the company considered the profitable performance for fiscal years and as well as recent contract awards which have increased the company s long term backlog to a higher level 
such contracts will enable the company to continue to generate operating profits in fiscal year and beyond 
these adjustments were made in the fourth quarters of fiscal and as the company waited until it had results for the full year to make final its determination  given the existence of a loss in recent years  that it met the accounting threshold for determination that the recovery of the deferred tax asset was more likely than not and to estimate the appropriate balance of the valuation allowance  based on all available information 
the amount of the non cash valuation allowance reductions in the fourth quarters was based on management s estimates of taxable income by reporting segment and taxing jurisdictions and the period over which the company believes deferred tax assets will be realized 
the table below sets forth for the fiscal years ended april  and  the percentage of consolidated net sales represented by certain items in the company s consolidated statements of operations revenues fei ny gillam fei fei zyfer less intersegment revenues cost of revenues gross margin selling and administrative expenses research and development expenses operating profit other income expenses  net benefit for income taxes net income revenues fiscal years ended april  in thousands change fei ny    gillam fei   fei zyfer   intersegment sales    fiscal year compared to fiscal year the increase in consolidated revenues in fiscal year over the prior year is primarily due to satellite payload revenues generated by the fei ny segment 
for the year ended april   revenues from commercial and us government satellite programs accounted for approximately half of consolidated revenues compared to approximately of revenues during fiscal year revenues on these long term contracts are recognized primarily under the percentage of completion method 
fiscal year revenues from fei elcom  after the acquisition  were less than million and are included in the fei ny segment s revenues 
increased network infrastructure revenues generated by the fei zyfer segment were offset by declines in that business area in the gillam fei segment and lower wireless infrastructure sales in the fei ny segment 
network infrastructure revenues were less than of consolidated revenues for the year ended april  compared to approximately for fiscal year in fiscal year  revenues from the non space us government dod business area  which are recorded in the fei ny and fei zyfer segments  were approximately of consolidated revenues compared to for fiscal year fiscal year revenues were lower due to completion of certain long term programs and delays in new program awards 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues for fiscal year increased by compared to fiscal year  due primarily to growth in all business areas served by the fei ny segment satellite payloads for both us government and commercial applications  us government dod non space products and wireless telecommunications networks 
revenue increases in the first two business areas were anticipated based on recently awarded contracts by satellite manufacturers for payload time and frequency systems and from us government contractors for low g sensitivity products 
certain telecommunication network infrastructure oem s unexpectedly increased their orders for components for use in wireless networks  including replacing systems destroyed by the march earthquake and tsunami in japan 
revenues for the gillam fei segment which are derived from wireline telecommunications networks and network management systems  were relatively flat year over year  while sales at fei zyfer declined 
the decrease in fei zyfer s sales volume reflected some of the impact from the us government budgetary issues which prevented certain dod programs from obtaining funding  causing either program delays or cancellations 
based on the company s current backlog  over two thirds of which represent satellite payload business  potential for additional new orders  as well as the company s recent acquisition of fei elcom tech  fiscal year revenues are expected to grow 
satellite payload revenues will remain the dominant portion of the company s business but revenues from the other major business areas  us government dod non space and network infrastructure  are also expected to increase over fiscal year levels 
gross margin rates fiscal years ended april  in thousands change gm rate for each of the years ended april  and  gross margin increased both in total and as a percentage of revenues as compared to the respective prior year 
the improvement is due both to increased revenues and product mix 
the largest gross margin rate improvement occurred in the company s fei ny segment as a higher volume of business covered more of that segment s fixed costs 
the and gross margin rates in fiscal years and approach the company s expected rate of at current revenue levels 
during fiscal year  cost of sales included increases to warranty reserves and inventory write downs which aggregated approximately million 
during fiscal year  cost of sales included inventory write downs of million 
these charges reduced gross margin rates by in fiscal year and by in fiscal year fiscal year gross margin was also reduced by the fourth quarter acquisition of fei elcom whose operating results are included in the fei ny segment 
with the current mix of programs and orders in its backlog  the company expects to realize gross margin rates at or near its target rate of 
as revenues increase in future periods  the company expects to realize a higher gross margin as more of its fixed costs are covered 
selling and administrative expenses fiscal years ended april  in thousands change in the fiscal years ended april  and  selling and administrative costs were and  respectively  of consolidated revenues 
in both years  the increase in expenses over the prior year is due primarily to increased deferred and incentive compensation expenses resulting from greater profitability 
fiscal year expenses also include selling and administrative expenses incurred by newly acquired fei elcom as well as transaction costs related to the acquisition which aggregated approximately  for the years ended april  and  selling and administrative expenses include stock compensation expense of  and  respectively 
expenses during fiscal year also include approximately  related to a stock award to its employees in celebration of the company s th anniversary 
the company expects fiscal year selling and administrative expenses to be incurred at approximately the same rate relative to revenues 
research and development expenses fiscal years ended april  in thousands change research and development r d expenditures represent investments intended to keep the company s products at the leading edge of time and frequency technology and enhance competitiveness for future revenues 
r d spending for the year ended april  was approximately of revenues compared to approximately of revenues for fiscal year r d spending in fiscal year continued to facilitate development of new satellite payload products from dc to ka band  development and improvement of miniaturized rubidium atomic clocks  development of new gps based synchronization products and further enhancement of the capabilities of its line of low g sensitivity and ruggedized rubidium oscillators 
the lower rate and lower r d expenditures in fiscal year are due primarily to the dedication of resources to customer funded programs rather than to internal research and development programs 
the cost of this customer funded development effort appears in cost of revenues  thus reducing the level of internal research and development spending 
although funding is obtained from customers  the rights to any products developed are retained by the company 
the company will continue to devote significant resources to develop new products  enhance existing products and implement efficient manufacturing processes 
for fiscal year  the company anticipates that internal research and development spending will be less than of revenues 
the company believes that internally generated cash and cash reserves are adequate to fund these development efforts 
operating profit fiscal years ended april  in thousands change higher revenues  improved gross margin rates and operating expenses in line with expectations for both fiscal years and enabled the company to record operating profit each year that was nearly twice the operating profit recorded in the respective preceding fiscal year 
on a segment basis  the operating profit of fei ny increased as a result of a increase in revenues and improved gross margin rates 
the fiscal year operating profit at gillam fei was favorably impacted by an improved product mix despite lower revenues than for fiscal year fei zyfer realized an operating loss due to lower gross margins partially due to increased warranty reserves as well as product mix 
on anticipated increased revenues and favorable product mix  the company expects to continue to improve its gross margin while maintaining other operating expenses within their targeted amounts 
thus  the company expects to report higher operating profits in fiscal year other income expense fiscal years ended april  in thousands change investment income gain on investment in affiliate nm equity loss impairment charge nm interest expense other expense  net investment income includes interest and dividend income on marketable securities 
earnings on these securities may vary based on fluctuating dividends and interest rates and the timing of purchases or sales of securities 
during the year ended april   the company broadened its investment portfolio to include higher yielding marketable securities 
the greater yield plus more income earning investments account for the year over year increase in investment income 
during fiscal year  investment income included approximately  of gains upon the sale or redemption of marketable securities 
in fiscal year  the company recorded investment losses of approximately  upon the sale or redemption of certain marketable securities in its portfolio 
during fiscal year  the company anticipates that investment income will be approximately the same as that earned in fiscal year as described above  the fiscal year step acquisition of fei elcom resulted in the recognition of a gain of approximately  equity losses of  represent the company s share of the losses recorded by fei elcom prior to the company s fourth quarter acquisition of that company see significant matters above 
in addition  during the second quarter of fiscal year  based on comparisons to comparable companies as well as fei elcom s forecasts of future financial results  the company recorded an impairment charge in the amount of  in fiscal years and  interest expense was incurred on borrowings under short term credit obligations  on deferred compensation payments and capital leases for equipment 
during the year ended april   to complete the acquisition of fei elcom  the company decided to draw on its bank line of credit rather than liquidate any of its investment in marketable securities 
as a result of this borrowing  the company anticipates that interest expense in fiscal year will be higher than that incurred in fiscal year other expenses for the year ended april   consisted primarily of amortization of certain non operating assets which was partially offset by gains of approximately  derived from the excess of proceeds over the cash values of life insurance policies covering a former employee 
the company anticipates that in future years items in this category will not be significant to pretax earnings 
income tax benefit fiscal years ended april  in thousands change as described above  during the fourth quarters of fiscal years and  the company reduced its valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in the amount of million and million  respectively 
these reductions were based on a review of all available evidence  both positive and negative  and management s assessment that it is more likely than not that it will be able to realize the tax benefits from the future deductibility of most items included in its deferred tax assets 
excluding the valuation allowance reduction  for the years ended april  and  the company recorded a net tax provision of million and million  respectively  or effective tax rates of and  respectively 
the company is subject to taxation in several countries 
the statutory federal rates are in the united states  in europe and in china 
the company utilizes the availability of research and development tax credits in the united states to lower its tax rate 
the actual rate incurred may be impacted by the non deductibility of losses incurred in overseas operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of the actual tax benefit to the expected tax provision at the federal statutory rate 
the company s european subsidiaries have available net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million to offset future taxable income 
these loss carryforwards have no expiration date 
as a result of the acquisition of fei elcom  the company has a federal net operating loss carryforward of million which may be applied in annually limited amounts to offset future us sourced taxable income over the next years 
for state of california income tax purposes  the company has a tax loss carryforward of approximately million which expires in years 
liquidity and capital resources the company s balance sheet continues to reflect a highly liquid position with working capital of million at april  included in working capital at april  is million consisting of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
the company s current ratio at april  is to compared to to at the end of the prior fiscal year 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended april   was million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
during fiscal years and  the company incurred million and million  respectively  in non cash charges to earnings  including depreciation and amortization expense  the equity loss on its elcom investment net of the gain on the investment  and certain employee benefit plan expenses  including accounting for stock based compensation 
in fiscal years and  such non cash charges were partially offset by the non cash benefit of million and million  respectively  resulting from the company s reduction of a portion of the valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets 
for fiscal year  operating cash was reduced by increases to accounts receivable and inventory 
in fiscal year  the company anticipates that it will maintain positive cash flow from operations by continuing to generate operating profits 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the fiscal year ended april   resulting from the additional investment in fei elcom for million  net of acquired cash of  net purchase of marketable securities for million and the acquisition of capital equipment for million 
for the year ended april   net cash used in investing activities was million which consisted of the net purchase of marketable securities for million and the purchase of property  plant and equipment for million 
the company may continue to invest cash equivalents in longer term securities or to convert short term investments to cash equivalents as dictated by its investment and acquisition strategies 
the company will continue to acquire more efficient equipment to automate its production process 
the company intends to spend between million and million on capital equipment during fiscal year internally generated cash is expected to be adequate to acquire this property  plant and equipment 
the company has a million line of credit with the financial institution which also manages a substantial portion of its investment in marketable securities 
if the balance of the investments decreases through liquidation or changes in value  the availability under the line of credit will also decrease 
the line is secured by its investments in marketable securities 
rather than liquidate some of these investments to meet short term working capital requirements  the company may borrow against the line of credit at variable interest rates currently averaging approximately  which is less than the return on the company s portfolio of marketable securities which secure the line 
to fund the acquisition of fei elcom during fiscal year  the company borrowed million  matching the previous highest level of borrowing under this line 
there were no amounts outstanding under the line of credit as of april  during fiscal year  the company may convert the short term debt into a longer term loan or it may repay a portion of the current borrowing 
in addition  the company s european subsidiaries have available approximately million in bank credit lines to meet short term cash flow requirements
