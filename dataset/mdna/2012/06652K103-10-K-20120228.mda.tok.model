item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis is intended to assist readers in understanding the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of bankunited  inc and its subsidiaries the company  we  us and our and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  accompanying footnotes and supplemental financial data included herein 
in addition to historical information  this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from management s expectations 
factors that could cause such differences are discussed in the sections entitled forward looking statements and risk factors 
we assume no obligation to update any of these forward looking statements 
overview performance highlights in measuring our financial performance  we evaluate the level of and trends in net interest income  the net interest margin and interest rate spread  the allowance and provision for loan losses  performance ratios such as the return on average assets and return on average equity  asset quality ratios including the ratio of non performing loans to total loans  non performing assets to total assets  and portfolio delinquency and charge off trends 
we consider growth in the loan portfolio and trends in deposit mix 
we analyze these ratios and trends against our own historical performance  our budgeted performance and the financial condition and performance of comparable financial institutions in our region and nationally 
performance highlights include the completion of the ipo of  shares of our common stock in february  at per share 
bankunited  inc sold  shares while selling stockholders sold  shares 
we received proceeds of million from the offering  net of underwriting discounts and million of direct stock issuance costs 
equity based compensation expense of million recorded in conjunction with the ipo had a significant impact on net income for this expense was not deductible for income tax purposes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements and the section entitled non interest expense below for further discussion of this expense 
net interest income for was million  an increase of million over the prior year 
the net interest margin increased to from for the primary drivers of improvement in the net interest margin were i an increase in the average yield on loans resulting primarily from improvements in actual and expected cash flows from loans acquired with evidence of deterioration in credit quality since origination  which we refer to as aci loans  and ii a decrease in the average rate paid on deposits resulting from declines in market interest rates and a continued shift in deposit mix away from time deposits and into demand  savings and money market accounts

table of contents margin  the interest rate spread  the average yield on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities for the years ended december  and graphic we experienced strong loan portfolio growth 
loans originated or purchased by us since the acquisition  which we refer to as new loans  increased by billion in new loan growth in outpaced the resolution of covered loans  resulting in net growth in the total loan portfolio 
most of the new loan growth was in the commercial portfolio segment  commensurate with our business strategy  which emphasizes commercial lending

the following charts illustrate the composition of deposits outstanding at december  and graphic asset quality remains strong 
at december   of the new commercial loan portfolio was rated pass and of the new residential portfolio was current 
credit risk related to the covered loans is significantly mitigated by the loss sharing agreements 

table of contents the bank s capital ratios exceed all regulatory well capitalized guidelines 
the charts below present bankunited s regulatory capital ratios compared to regulatory guidelines as of december  and graphic in february   we received regulatory approvals from the occ and the federal reserve bank for the acquisition of herald  a national banking association based in the new york metropolitan area 
herald had total assets of approximately million as of december  the acquisition of herald will ultimately allow the company to begin to expand its footprint into the new york market 
we anticipate closing the herald acquisition on february  herald will be operated as a separate subsidiary of bankunited  inc until august of  at which time we plan to merge herald into bankunited 
opportunities and challenges management has identified significant opportunities for our company  including our capital position  market presence and experienced lending team position us well to compete for high quality commercial credits in our primary market areas 
in  we intend to deploy excess liquidity into loans through expansion of our existing product lines and the introduction of new lending platforms including indirect auto and floor plan loans and an expanded leasing product line 
we will continue our existing efforts to favorably resolve covered loans 
organic growth through planned expansion of our branch footprint in florida and in the new york area through the herald acquisition 
potential growth through strategic acquisitions of healthy financial institutions and complementary businesses and participation in the resolution of failed and troubled institutions in the southeast and new york 
the potential to further shift our deposit mix from time deposits into lower cost money market and transaction accounts 
the continued enhancement of our technology platforms will enable us to expand product offerings to our customers and increase operational efficiency 
we have also identified significant challenges confronting the industry and our company the economic impact of the financial crisis continued into and is expected to continue into florida home prices continued to decline in  as evidenced by a decline in the 
table of contents case shiller home price index for the state of florida over the course of the year 
the unemployment rate in florida remained high  at as of december these continued distressed economic conditions may lead to elevated levels of non performing assets and deterioration in the credit quality of our loan portfolio and may impact our ability to continue to favorably resolve covered loans 
economic conditions in our primary market may serve to limit loan demand  which will impact our ability to add higher yielding assets to the balance sheet and put pressure on our net interest margin 
the current low interest rate environment is likely to put pressure on our net interest margin  particularly as higher yielding covered assets are liquidated or mature and are replaced with assets purchased or originated at current market rates of interest 
management expects that the company and the banking industry as a whole may be required by market forces and or regulation to operate with higher capital ratios than in the recent past 
uncertainty about the full impact of new regulation  including the dodd frank act  may present challenges in the execution of our business strategy and the management of non interest expense 
for additional discussion  see item business regulation and supervision 
the full integration of herald into bankunited in august periods presented financial information presented throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the years ended december  and and the period from may  through december  which we refer to as the post acquisition periods is that of the company 
historical financial information for the period from october  through may  and the fiscal year ended september  which we refer to as the pre acquisition periods is that of the failed bank 
results of operations of the company for the post acquisition periods are not comparable to the results of operations of the failed bank for the pre acquisition period 
results of operations for the post acquisition periods reflect  among other things  the application of the acquisition method of accounting  the application of accounting standards codification asc section  loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality to aci loans  and the impact of the provisions of the loss sharing agreements on certain transactions in the covered assets 
impact of acquisition accounting  aci loan accounting and the loss sharing agreements the application of acquisition accounting  aci loan accounting and the provisions of the loss sharing agreements have had a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations in the post acquisition periods 
the more significant ways in which our financial statements have been impacted are summarized below and discussed in more detail throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the acquisition method of accounting  all of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were initially recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at their estimated fair values as of may  these estimated fair values differed materially from the carrying amounts of many of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as reflected in the financial statements of the failed bank immediately prior to the acquisition 
in particular  the carrying amount of investment securities  loans  the fdic indemnification asset  goodwill and other intangible assets  net deferred tax assets  deposit liabilities  and fhlb advances were materially impacted by these adjustments 
the impact of acquisition accounting fair value adjustments on individual line items in the consolidated balance sheet at acquisition is detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements  
table of contents interest income  interest expense and the net interest margin subsequent to the acquisition reflect the impact of accretion of the fair value adjustments made to the carrying amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the estimated fair value at which the acquired loans were initially recorded by the company was significantly less than the unpaid principal balances of the loans or the pre acquisition carrying value of those loans on the balance sheet of the failed bank 
no allowance for loan and lease losses was recorded with respect to acquired loans at the acquisition date 
the write down of loans to fair value in conjunction with the application of acquisition accounting and credit protection provided by the loss sharing agreements results in a significantly lower impact on the results of operations related to the provision for loan losses subsequent to the acquisition  acquired investment securities were recorded at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date  significantly reducing the potential for other than temporary impairment charges in periods subsequent to the acquisition for the acquired securities 
certain of the acquired investment securities are covered under the loss sharing agreements 
the impact on results of operations of any future other than temporary impairment charges related to covered securities would be significantly mitigated by indemnification by the fdic  an indemnification asset related to the loss sharing agreements with the fdic was recorded in conjunction with the acquisition 
loans  oreo and certain investment securities  including certain private label mortgage backed and non investment grade securities acquired from the failed bank are covered by the loss sharing agreements with the fdic 
the loss sharing agreements afford the company significant protection against future credit losses related to these assets  non interest income for periods subsequent to the acquisition includes the effects of accretion of discount on the indemnification asset  non interest income for the post acquisition periods includes gains and losses associated with the resolution of covered assets and the related effect of indemnification under the terms of the loss sharing agreements 
the impact of gains or losses related to transactions in covered loans and other real estate owned is significantly mitigated by indemnification by the fdic  certain loans that may have been reflected as nonaccrual loans in the financial statements of the failed bank are not categorized as non performing assets due to the accounting treatment accorded such loans under asc subtopic the balances of non performing assets were significantly reduced by the adjustments to fair value recorded in conjunction with the acquisition  and goodwill and other intangible assets were recorded in conjunction with the acquisition 
these factors also impact the comparability of our financial performance to that of other financial institutions 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and follow general practices within the banking industry 
application of these principles requires management to make complex and subjective estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under current circumstances 
these assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from independent  objective sources 
we 
table of contents evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis 
use of alternative assumptions may have resulted in significantly different estimates 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
accounting policies are an integral part of our financial statements 
a thorough understanding of these accounting policies is essential when reviewing our reported results of operations and our financial position 
we believe that the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed below involve additional management judgment due to the complexity  subjectivity and sensitivity involved in their application 
note to the consolidated financial statements contains a further discussion of our significant accounting policies 
allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance for loan and lease losses alll represents management s estimate of probable loan losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio 
determining the amount of the alll is considered a critical accounting estimate because of its complexity and because it requires significant judgment and estimation 
estimates that are particularly susceptible to change that may have a material impact on the amount of the alll include the amount and timing of expected future cash flows from aci loans and impaired loans  the value of underlying collateral  which impacts loss severity and certain cash flow assumptions  estimated losses based on risk characteristics and risk rating of loans  and consideration of a variety of qualitative factors 
note of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the alll 
accounting for acquired loans and the fdic indemnification asset a significant portion of the covered loans acquired on may  and covered by the loss sharing agreements were aci loans 
the accounting for aci loans requires the company to estimate the timing and amount of cash flows to be collected from these loans and to continually update estimates of the cash flows expected to be collected over the life of the loans 
similarly  the accounting for the fdic indemnification asset requires the company to estimate the timing and amount of cash flows to be received from the fdic in reimbursement for losses and expenses related to the covered loans  these estimates are directly related to estimates of cash flows to be received from the covered loans 
estimated cash flows impact the rate of accretion on covered loans and the fdic indemnification asset as well as the amount of any alll to be established related to the covered loans 
these estimates are considered to be critical accounting estimates because they involve significant judgment and assumptions as to the amount and timing of cash flows to be collected 
covered single family residential and home equity loans were placed into homogenous pools at acquisition  the ongoing credit quality and performance of these loans is monitored on a pool basis and expected cash flows are estimated on a pool basis 
at acquisition  the fair value of the pools was measured based on the expected cash flows to be derived from each pool 
for aci pools  the difference between total contractual payments due and the cash flows expected to be received at acquisition was recognized as non accretable difference 
the excess of expected cash flows over the recorded fair value of each aci pool at acquisition is referred to as the accretable yield and is being recognized as interest income over the life of each pool 
we monitor the pools quarterly by updating our expected cash flows to determine whether any material changes have occurred in expected cash flows that would be indicative of impairment or 
table of contents necessitate reclassification between non accretable difference and accretable yield 
initial and ongoing cash flow expectations incorporate significant assumptions regarding prepayment rates  the timing of resolution of loans  frequency of default  delinquency and loss severity  which is dependent on estimates of underlying collateral values 
changes in these assumptions could have a potentially material impact on the amount of the alll related to the covered loans as well as on the rate of accretion on these loans 
prepayment  delinquency and default curves used to forecast pool cash flows are derived from roll rates generated from the historical performance of the aci residential loan portfolio observed over the immediately preceding four quarters 
generally  improvements in expected cash flows less than of the expected cash flows from a pool are not recorded 
this threshold is judgmentally determined and may be revised as we gain greater experience 
generally  commercial loans are monitored and expected cash flows updated individually due to the size and other unique characteristics of these loans 
the expected cash flows are estimated based on judgments and assumptions which include credit risk grades established in the bank s ongoing credit review program  likelihood of default based on observations of specific loans during the credit review process as well as applicable industry data  loss severity based on updated evaluation of cash flows from available collateral  and the contractual terms of the underlying loan agreements 
changes in the assumptions that impact forecasted cash flows could result in a potentially material change to the amount of the alll or the rate of accretion on these loans 
the estimated cash flows from the fdic indemnification asset are sensitive to changes in the same assumptions that impact expected cash flows on covered loans 
estimated cash flows impact the rate of accretion on the fdic indemnification asset 
other real estate owned assets acquired through  or in lieu of  loan foreclosure are held for sale and are initially recorded at the fair value of the collateral at the date of foreclosure based on estimates  including some obtained from third parties  less estimated costs to sell  establishing a new cost basis 
subsequent to foreclosure  valuations are periodically performed by management  and the assets are carried at the lower of cost or fair value  less estimated costs to sell 
significant property improvements that enhance the salability of the property are capitalized to the extent that the carrying value does not exceed estimated realizable value 
legal fees  maintenance and other direct costs of foreclosed properties are expensed as incurred 
given the large number of properties included in oreo  and the judgment involved in estimating fair value of the properties  accounting for oreo is regarded as a critical accounting policy 
estimates of value of oreo properties at the date of foreclosure are typically based on real estate appraisals performed by independent appraisers 
in some cases  if an appraisal is not available  values may be based on brokers price opinions 
these values are generally updated as appraisals become available 
subsequently  values may be updated using case shiller home price indices for the relevant metropolitan statistical area 
equity based compensation prior to the consummation of the ipo  the llc had issued equity awards in the form of profits interest units pius to certain members of management 
compensation expense related to pius was based on the fair value of the underlying units on the date of the consolidated financial statements 
at the time of the ipo  the pius were exchanged for a combination of vested and unvested shares and vested and unvested options 
the fair value of pius and options issued in exchange for pius was estimated using a black scholes option pricing model  which incorporated significant assumptions as to expected volatility  dividends  terms  risk free rates and  prior to the ipo  equity value per share 
changes in these underlying assumptions would have a potentially material effect on the values assigned to these instruments 
determining the fair value of the pius and the options issued in exchange for the pius is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant 
table of contents judgments and the determination of fair value may be material to our consolidated financial statements 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies and note  equity based compensation and other benefit plans to our consolidated financial statements for further information about equity based compensation awards and the techniques used to value them 
income taxes the company is subject to the income tax laws of the united states and states and other jurisdictions where the company conducts business 
these laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the various taxing authorities 
in determining the provision for income taxes  management must make judgments and estimates about the application of these laws and related regulations 
in the process of preparing the company s tax returns  management attempts to make reasonable interpretations of the tax laws 
these interpretations are subject to challenge by the tax authorities upon audit or to re interpretation based on management s ongoing assessment of facts and evolving case law 
given the judgment involved in various aspects of accounting for income taxes  this is considered a critical accounting estimate 
see note income taxes of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information 
fair value measurements the company measures certain of its assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring or non recurring basis 
assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis include investment securities available for sale  derivative instruments and  for periods prior to the ipo  the liability for pius 
assets that may be measured at fair value on a non recurring basis include oreo  impaired loans  loans held for sale and intangible assets 
the consolidated financial statements also include disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments that are not recorded at fair value 
fair value is the price that would be received on sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
inputs used to determine fair value measurements are prioritized into a three level hierarchy based on observability and transparency of the inputs  summarized as follows level observable inputs that reflect quoted prices in active markets  level inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are based on observable market data  and level unobservable inputs requiring significant management judgment or estimation 
when observable market inputs are not available  fair value is estimated using modeling techniques such as discounted cash flow analyses and option pricing models 
these modeling techniques utilize assumptions that we believe market participants would use in pricing the asset or the liability 
particularly for estimated fair values of assets and liabilities categorized within level of the fair value hierarchy  the selection of different valuation techniques or underlying assumptions could result in fair value estimates that are higher or lower than the amounts recorded or disclosed in our consolidated financial statements 
considerable judgment may be involved in determining the amount that is most representative of fair value 
because of the degree of judgment involved in selecting valuation techniques and underlying assumptions  fair value measurements are considered a critical accounting estimate 
notes   and to our consolidated financial statements contain further information about fair value estimates 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 
results of operations for the post acquisition periods the company reported net income of million  million and million for the years ended december  and and the period from april  date of inception through december   respectively 
net income for the year ended december  was impacted by the million equity based compensation charge recorded in conjunction with the ipo 
this expense was not deductible for income tax purposes 
net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets and interest incurred on interest bearing liabilities and is the primary driver of core earnings 
key measures that we use to evaluate our net interest income are the level and stability of the net interest margin and the interest rate spread 
net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income for the period by average interest earning assets 
the interest rate spread is the difference between the yield earned on average interest earning assets and the rate paid on average interest bearing liabilities for the period 
net interest income is impacted by the relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the ratio of interest earning assets to total assets and of interest bearing liabilities to total funding sources  levels of and movements in market interest rates  levels of non performing assets and pricing pressure from competitors 
the mix of interest earning assets is influenced by loan demand and by management s continual assessment of the rate of return and relative risk associated with various classes of earning assets 
the mix of interest bearing liabilities is influenced by management s assessment of the need for lower cost funding sources weighed against relationships with customers and growth requirements and is impacted by competition for deposits in the bank s market and the availability and pricing of other sources of funds 
net interest income is also impacted by accretion of fair value adjustments recorded in conjunction with the acquisition and the accounting for aci loans 
at acquisition  aci loans were recorded at fair value  measured based on the present value of expected cash flows 
the excess of expected cash flows over the recorded fair value at acquisition  known as accretable yield  is being recognized as interest income over the lives of the underlying loans 
accretion related to aci loans has a positive impact on our net interest income  net interest margin and interest rate spread 
the impact of accretion related to aci loans on net interest income is expected to decline in the future as aci loans comprise a declining percentage of total loans 
the proportion of total loans represented by aci loans will decline as the aci loans are resolved and new loans are added to the portfolio 
aci loans represented  and of total loans  net of discount and deferred fees and costs  at december   and  respectively 
payments received in excess of expected cash flows may result in a pool of aci residential loans becoming fully amortized and its carrying value reduced to zero even though outstanding contractual balances remain related to loans in the pool 
once the carrying value of a pool is reduced to zero  any future proceeds from the remaining loans are recognized as interest income upon receipt 
in late  the carrying value of one pool was reduced to zero 
future expected cash flows from this pool total million 
we expect that future proceeds from loans in this pool will result in an increase in interest income from the pool 
to some extent  the increase in interest income will be offset by a reduction in non interest income reported in the consolidated statement of income line item income 
table of contents from resolution of covered assets  net 
the timing of receipt of proceeds from loans in this pool may be unpredictable  leading to increased volatility in the yield on the pool 
fair value adjustments of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities recorded at acquisition are accreted to interest income or expense over the lives of the related assets or liabilities 
generally  accretion of fair value adjustments increases interest income and decreases interest expense  and thus has a positive impact on our net interest income  net interest margin and interest rate spread 
the impact of accretion of fair value adjustments on interest income and interest expense has declined each year since the acquisition and will continue to decline as these assets and liabilities mature or are repaid and constitute a smaller portion of total interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the impact of accretion and aci loan accounting on net interest income makes it difficult to compare our net interest margin and interest rate spread to those reported by other financial institutions 
the following table presents  for the periods indicated  information about i average balances  the total dollar amount of interest income from earning assets and the resultant average yields  ii average balances  the total dollar amount of interest expense on interest bearing liabilities and the resultant average rates  iii net interest income  iv the interest rate spread  and v the net interest margin 
nonaccrual and restructured loans are included in the average balances presented in this table

increases and decreases in interest income and interest expense result from changes in average balances volume of interest earning assets and liabilities  as well as changes in average interest rates 
the comparison of total interest income and total interest expense for the year ended december  to the period ended december  is also impacted by the different number of days in the comparative periods 
the following table shows the effect that these factors had on the interest earned on our interest earning assets and the interest incurred on our interest bearing liabilities for the periods indicated 
the effect of changes in volume is determined by multiplying the change in volume by the previous period s average rate 
similarly  the effect of rate changes is calculated by multiplying the 
table of contents change in average rate by the previous period s volume 
changes applicable to both volume and rate have been allocated to volume in thousands year ended december  compared to year ended december  year ended december  compared to period ended december  changes in volume changes in rate total increase decrease changes in volume changes in rate change due to number of days total increase decrease interest income attributable to investment securities available for sale other interest earning assets loans total interest income interest expense attributable to interest bearing demand deposits savings and money market deposits time deposits total interest bearing deposits fhlb advances short term borrowings total interest expense increase decrease in net interest income year ended december  compared to year ended december  net interest income increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
the increase was comprised of an increase in interest income of million coupled with a decline in interest expense of million 
the increase in interest income was primarily driven by an million increase in interest income from loans 
the average yield on loans increased by basis points  to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december   primarily because of an increase in the yield on loans acquired in the acquisition to for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  this increase resulted from i covered loans being resolved at a faster rate than expected  resulting in higher accretion  ii improved default frequency and severity rates leading to an increase in expected cash flows  iii favorable resolutions of commercial aci loans and iv to a lesser extent  recognition of all proceeds from resolution of loans in one residential pool with a carrying value of zero as interest income  as discussed above 
the average yield on new loans declined to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december   primarily due to continued declines in market interest rates 
new loans constituted of loans  net of unearned discount and deferred fees and costs  at december  as compared to at december  the overall increase in the average yield on loans was in part offset by a decrease of million in the average balance outstanding 
the decrease in the average balance of loans resulted from paydowns and resolutions of covered loans  partially offset by growth in the new loan portfolio 
the average balance of acquired loans declined to billion for the year ended december  from billion for the year ended december   while the average balance of new loans grew to million from million for the years ended december  and  respectively 

table of contents interest income from investment securities declined by million as a result of a decrease in the average yield to from  almost wholly offset by a million increase in the average balance 
the decline in average yield is indicative of the addition of securities to the portfolio at lower prevailing market rates of interest 
the decline in interest expense for the year ended december  was primarily driven by a decrease of million in interest expense on deposits  partially offset by an increase of million in interest expense on fhlb advances 
the average rate paid on interest bearing deposits declined by basis points  to from 
three factors contributed to the decline in the average rate paid on deposits 
a decrease in market rates of interest across all deposit product groups and continued runoff of higher cost time deposits were partially offset by a reduction in accretion of acquisition date fair value adjustments 
accretion of fair value adjustments on time deposits totaled million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  accretion continues to decrease as time deposits outstanding at the date of the acquisition mature 
the average rate paid on time deposits  exclusive of fair value accretion  declined to for from for a decline in the overall average balance of deposits also contributed to reduced interest expense 
consistent with our strategy of replacing more costly time deposits with lower cost deposits  the average balance of time deposits declined by billion while the average balance of interest bearing demand  savings and money market deposits increased by million 
the increase in interest expense on fhlb advances was primarily attributable to a decrease of million in accretion of acquisition date fair value adjustments 
the net interest margin increased by basis points to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  similarly  the interest rate spread increased by basis points to for from for increases in the net interest margin and interest rate spread were driven primarily by the increased yield on loans and the lower cost of interest bearing deposits discussed above 
year ended december  compared to period from may  to december  net interest income was million for the year ended december  and million for the period ended december   for an increase of million 
the increase in net interest income was comprised of an increase in interest income of million partially offset by an increase in interest expense of million 
on an annualized basis  net interest income was million and million for the year ended december  and period ended december   respectively 
the decline of million  or  in annualized net interest income was comprised of an increase of million in annualized interest expense partly offset by an increase of million in annualized interest income 
the increase in interest income on an annualized basis reflected increased interest income from investment securities partially offset by a decline in interest income from loans 
the increase in interest income from investment securities resulted from an increase in average volume significantly mitigated by a decline in the average yield 
the average yield on investment securities declined to for the year ended december  from for the period ended december  the decrease in average yield resulted primarily from new purchases reflecting lower general market rates of interest as well as the continued impact of a shift since the acquisition in the type of securities purchased  including billion of us government agency floating rate securities and billion of non mortgage asset backed securities purchased as of december  the decline in interest income from loans is indicative of a decline in average volume resulting from pay downs and resolutions  partially offset by an increase in the average yield to for the year ended december  as compared to for the period ended december  the increased yield reflects an increased yield on covered loans partially offset by the origination and purchase of new 
table of contents loans at lower prevailing market rates of interest 
the average yield on new loans was and for the year ended december  and period ended december   respectively 
the yield on covered loans increased to for the year ended december  from for the period ending december  due to an increase in projected cash flows from the covered aci loans 
interest expense on deposits increased on an annualized basis by million for the year ended december  due to lower accretion of fair market value adjustments on time deposits  partially mitigated by a shift in deposit mix toward lower rate products and a decline in market rates 
accretion of fair value adjustments on time deposits totaled million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the period ended december  the decline in accretion of fair value adjustments on time deposits is attributable to the maturity and continued run off of acquired time deposits 
the average rate paid on time deposits excluding the impact of accretion was for the year ended december  and for the period ended december  the decline in the adjusted average rate is attributable to lower prevailing rates 
interest expense on fhlb advances and other borrowings increased by million on an annualized basis  primarily as a result of lower accretion of fair value adjustments 
accretion of fair value adjustments on fhlb advances totaled million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the period ended december  accretion decreased the average rate paid on fhlb advances by and basis points for the year ended december  and period ended december   respectively 
the decline in accretion is due to the maturity and repayment of a portion of the advances outstanding at the acquisition date  offset by the difference in the number of days in the comparative periods 
the net interest margin for the year ended december  was as compared to for the period ending december   a decline of basis points 
the average yield on interest earning assets declined by basis points for the year ended december  as compared to the period ended december  while the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased by basis points  for a decline in the interest rate spread of basis points 
the decline in both net interest margin and interest rate spread resulted primarily from lower accretion of fair value adjustments  particularly on interest bearing liabilities  the origination and purchase of loans and investment securities at lower prevailing market rates of interest  and a shift in the composition of interest earning assets from loans to investment securities as discussed above 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is the amount of expense that  based on our judgment  is required to maintain the alll at an adequate level to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date and that  in management s judgment  is appropriate under us generally accepted accounting principles 
the determination of the amount of the allowance is complex and involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity 
our determination of the amount of the allowance and corresponding provision for loan losses considers ongoing evaluations of the various segments of the loan portfolio and of individually significant credits  levels of non performing loans and charge offs  statistical trends and economic and other relevant factors 
see analysis of the allowance for loan and lease losses below for more information about how we determine the appropriate level of the allowance 
because the determination of fair value at which the loans acquired from the failed bank were initially recorded as of may  encompassed assumptions about expected future cash flows and credit risk  no alll was recorded at the date of acquisition 
fair value adjustments to the carrying amount of acquired loans totaled billion 
subsequent to the acquisition  an allowance for loan losses related to the aci loans is recorded only when estimates of future cash flows related to these loans are revised downward  indicating further deterioration in credit quality 
an allowance for loan 
table of contents losses for non aci loans may be established if factors considered relevant by management indicate that the credit quality of the non aci loans has deteriorated 
since the recognition of a provision for loan losses on covered loans represents an increase in the amount of reimbursement we ultimately expect to receive from the fdic  we also record an increase in the fdic indemnification asset for the present value of the projected increase in reimbursement  with a corresponding increase in non interest income  recorded in net gain loss on indemnification asset as discussed below in the section entitled non interest income 
therefore  the impact on our results of operations of any provision for loan losses on covered loans is significantly mitigated by an increase in non interest income 
for the years ended december  and and the period ended december   we recorded provisions for recoveries of loan losses on covered loans of million  million and million  respectively 
for the years ended december  and and the period ended december   the impact on earnings from these provisions was significantly mitigated by recording non interest income of million  million and million  respectively 
for the years ended december  and and the period ended december   we recorded provisions for loan losses of million  million and million  respectively  for new loans 
these loans are not protected by the loss sharing agreements and as such  these provisions are not offset by an increase in non interest income 
non interest income the company reported non interest income of million  million and million for the years ended december  and and the period ended december   respectively 
the majority of our non interest income resulted from the resolution of assets covered by our loss sharing agreements with the fdic and accretion of discount on the fdic indemnification asset 
non interest income related to transactions in covered assets represented  and of total non interest income for the years ended december  and and the period ended december   respectively 
typically  the primary components of non interest income of financial institutions are service charges and fees and gains or losses related to the sale or valuation of investment securities  loans and other assets 
thus  it is difficult to compare the amount and composition of our non interest income with that of other financial institutions of our size 

table of contents the following table presents a comparison of the categories of non interest income for the years ended december  and and the period ended december  in thousands accretion of discount on fdic indemnification asset income from resolution of covered assets  net net gain loss on indemnification asset fdic reimbursement of costs of resolution of covered assets loss on sale of loans  net non interest income from covered assets service charges on deposits and other fee income service charges on loans gain loss on sale or exchange of investment securities available for sale mortgage insurance income settlement with the fdic investment services income gain on extinguishment of debt other non interest income non interest income related to transactions in the covered assets accretion of discount on the fdic indemnification asset totaled million  million and million for the years ended december  and and the period ended december   respectively 
accretion is a result of discounting and may also increase or decrease from period to period due to changes in expected cash flows from the aci loans 
the fdic indemnification asset was recorded at acquisition at its estimated fair value of billion  representing the present value of estimated future cash payments from the fdic for probable losses on covered assets  up to days of past due interest  excluding interest related to loans on nonaccrual at acquisition  and reimbursement of certain expenses 
a discount rate of  determined using a risk free yield curve plus a premium reflecting uncertainty related to the collection  amount and timing of cash flows and liquidity concerns  was used in the initial calculation of fair value 
if projected cash flows from the aci loans increase  the yield on the loans will increase accordingly and the discount rate of accretion on the fdic indemnification asset will decrease as less cash flow is expected to be recovered from the indemnification asset 
for the years ended december  and and the period ended december   the average rate at which discount was accreted on the fdic indemnification asset was  and  respectively 
the decrease in total accretion for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  and for the year ended december  as compared to the period ended december  related both to the decrease in the average discount rate and to the decrease in the average balance of the indemnification asset 
the average balance of the indemnification asset decreased primarily as a result of the submission of claims and receipt of cash from the fdic under the terms of the loss sharing agreements 
we expect the amount of accretion to continue to decline in future periods because our projected cash flows from aci loans have continued to increase  and as a result we expect to collect less cash flow from the indemnification asset 
additionally  as we continue to 
table of contents submit claims under the loss sharing agreements  the remaining balance of the indemnification asset will continue to decline 
the balance of the fdic indemnification asset is also reduced or increased as a result of decreases or increases in estimated cash flows to be received from the fdic related to the gains or losses recorded in our consolidated financial statements from transactions in the covered assets 
when these transaction gains or losses are recorded  we also record an offsetting amount in the income statement line item net gain loss on indemnification asset 
this line item includes the significantly mitigating impact of fdic indemnification related to the following types of transactions in covered assets gains or losses from the resolution of covered assets  provisions for recoveries of losses on covered loans  gains or losses on the sale of covered loans  gains or losses on the sale of oreo  and impairment of oreo 
each of these types of transactions is discussed further below

the difference between consideration received in resolution of covered loans and the amount of projected losses from resolution of those loans is recorded in the income statement line item income from resolution of covered assets  net 
both gains and losses on individual resolutions are included in this line item 
losses from the resolution of covered loans increase the amount recoverable from the fdic under the loss sharing agreements 
gains from the resolution of covered loans reduce the amount recoverable from the fdic under the loss sharing agreements 
these additions to or reductions in amounts recoverable from the fdic related to the resolution of covered loans are recorded in non interest income in the line item net gain loss on indemnification asset and reflected as corresponding increases or decreases in the fdic indemnification asset 
the amount of income recorded in any period will be impacted by the number and upb of aci loans resolved  the amount of consideration received  and our ability to accurately project cash flows 
table of contents from aci loans in future periods 
as history of the performance and resolution of aci loans has grown and we have updated our projections of cash flows from the aci loans  gains or losses recorded on resolution of covered loans have declined in overall significance 
as our projections of cash flows from the aci loans have been updated  these cash flows have increasingly been reflected in interest income  through increased yields and higher accretion  rather than in income from resolution of covered assets 
this decline is particularly apparent when comparing income from resolution of covered assets  net for the year ended december  to that for the year ended december  for the years ended december  and and the period ended december   aci loans with a upb of billion  billion and billion were resolved  resulting in income of million  million and million  respectively 
income from the resolution of non aci loans is not significant 
the following table provides further detail of the components of income from resolution of covered assets  net for the years ended december  and and the period ended december  in thousands payments in full foreclosures short sales modifications charge offs recoveries income from resolution of covered assets  net as expected  the impact of payments in full on the results of operations declined for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  as additional history with the performance of covered loans has been reflected in our updated cash flow forecasts and the number of paid in full resolutions has declined 
in contrast  the volume of loan resolutions resulting from payments in full increased for the year ended december  compared to the period ended december  as we augmented and enhanced our mortgage servicing and workout and recovery departments and our efforts to work with borrowers to effect resolution of outstanding loans 
we expect the impact on non interest income of resolutions from payments in full to decline further in the future as we continue to update our cash flow forecasts and the number of loans in the portfolio likely to be resolved in this manner decreases 
continuing home price depreciation in our primary market areas led to increased losses  or declines in net gains  from short sales and foreclosures for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  and for the year ended december  as compared to the period ended december  under the purchase and assumption agreement  we are permitted to sell on an annual basis up to of the covered loans  based upon the upb at acquisition  or approximately million  without prior consent of the fdic 
any losses incurred from such loan sales are covered under the loss sharing agreements 
the significantly mitigating amounts recoverable from the fdic related to these losses are recorded as increases in the fdic indemnification asset and corresponding increases in the non interest income line item net gain loss on indemnification asset 
sales of covered loans for 
table of contents the years ended december  and and the period ended december  are summarized as follows in thousands unpaid principal balance of loans sold gross cash proceeds carrying value of loans sold transaction costs incurred loss on sale of covered loans related gain on indemnification asset loans were sold on a non recourse basis to third parties 
we may continue to exercise our right to sell covered loans in future periods 
in addition to the losses on sales of covered loans reflected in the table above  the income statement line item loss on sale of loans  net for the years ended december  and includes approximately thousand and thousand of gains on the sale of loans held for sale 
these transactions are not subject to the loss sharing agreements 
additional impairment arising since the acquisition related to covered loans is recorded in earnings through the provision for losses on covered loans 
under the terms of the loss sharing agreements  the company is entitled to recover from the fdic a portion of losses on these loans  therefore  the discounted amount of additional expected cash flows from the fdic related to these losses is recorded in non interest income in the line item net gain loss on indemnification asset and reflected as a corresponding increase in the fdic indemnification asset 
the company records impairment charges related to declines in the net realizable value of oreo properties subject to the loss sharing agreements and recognizes additional gains or losses upon the eventual sale of such oreo properties 
these amounts are included in non interest expense in the consolidated financial statements 
the estimated increase or reduction in amounts recoverable from the fdic with respect to these gains and losses is reflected as an increase or decrease in the fdic indemnification asset and in non interest income in the line item net gain loss on indemnification asset 
net gain loss on indemnification asset of million  million and million was recorded for the years ended december  and and the period ended december   respectively  representing the net change in the fdic indemnification asset from increases or decreases in cash flows estimated to be received from the fdic related to gains and losses from covered assets as discussed in the preceding paragraphs

table of contents certain oreo and foreclosure related expenses  including fees paid to attorneys and other service providers  property preservation costs  maintenance and repair costs  advances for taxes and insurance  appraisal costs and inspection costs are also reimbursed under the terms of the loss sharing agreements with the fdic 
such expenses are recorded in non interest expense when incurred  and the reimbursement is recorded as fdic reimbursement of costs of resolution of covered assets in non interest income when submitted to the fdic  generally upon ultimate resolution of the underlying covered asset 
this may result in the expense and the related income from reimbursements being recorded in different periods 
for the years ended december  and and the period ended december  non interest expense includes approximately million  million and million  respectively  of disbursements subject to reimbursement under the loss sharing agreements 
for those same periods  claims of million  million and million  respectively  were submitted to the fdic for reimbursement 
as of december   million of disbursements remain to be submitted for reimbursement from the fdic in future periods 
other components of non interest income mortgage insurance income represents mortgage insurance proceeds received with respect to covered loans in excess of the portion of losses on those loans that is recoverable from the fdic 
mortgage insurance proceeds up to the amount of losses on covered loans reimbursable by the fdic offsets amounts otherwise recoverable from the fdic 
the increase in mortgage insurance income for the years ended december  and as compared to the period ended december  is a result of increased efforts by the company to file and collect insurance claims 
investment services income represents fees earned by buis for wealth management services 
the increase for the years ended december  and as compared to the period ended december  reflects an increased level of activity by buis 
non interest income for the year ended december  includes approximately million representing the settlement of a dispute with the fdic associated with the valuation established on certain investment securities at acquisition 
the company prepaid fhlb advances with a principal balance of billion during the period ended december  these advances had a carrying amount of billion at the time of repayment 
the company recognized a gain of million on this transaction 
the increase in other non interest income for the year ended december  as compared to the period ended december  related primarily to an increase in loan modification incentives received under the us treasury hamp program and increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance 

table of contents non interest expense the following table presents the components of non interest expense for the years ended december  and and the period ended december  in thousands employee compensation and benefits occupancy and equipment impairment of other real estate owned foreclosure expense loss on sale of other real estate owned other real estate owned expense change in value of fdic warrant deposit insurance expense professional fees telecommunications and data processing other non interest expense loss on fdic receivable acquisition related costs non interest expense as a percentage of average assets was  and  on an annualized basis  for the years ended december  and and the period ended december   respectively 
the primary cause of the increase in this ratio for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was higher employee compensation and benefits expense 
the largest component of the increase in employee compensation and benefits was the million of equity based compensation recorded in conjunction with the ipo 
the main reason for the decline in non interest expense as a percentage of average assets for the year ended december  as compared to the period ended december  on an annualized basis was non recurring expenses related to the acquisition incurred during the period ended december  employee compensation and benefits as is typical for financial institutions  employee compensation and benefits represents the single largest component of recurring non interest expense 
employee compensation and benefits increased by approximately million or for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  and million  or on an annualized basis for the year ended december  as compared to the period ended december  these increases resulted primarily from increases in equity based compensation 
the increases are also attributable to continued enhancement of our management team and other personnel subsequent to the acquisition 
employee compensation and benefits included million  inclusive of the million charge recorded in conjunction with the ipo  million and million for the years ended december  and and the period ended december   respectively  related to equity based compensation 
included in these amounts is million  million and million for the years ended december  and and the period ended december   respectively  related to pius and  for  instruments issued in exchange for pius  as discussed below 
prior to the consummation of the ipo  our employee compensation and benefits expense included expense related to pius issued to certain members of executive management 
the pius were divided into two equal types of profits interests 
half of the pius  referred to as time based pius  vested with the passage of time following the grant date 
compensation expense related to time based pius was recorded on a straight line basis over the vesting period based on their fair value 
fair value of the 
table of contents time based pius was estimated using a black scholes option pricing model incorporating estimates of the per share value of our common stock and assumptions as to expected volatility  dividends  expected term  and risk free rates 
the remaining half of the pius  referred to as irr based pius  vested immediately prior to the consummation of the ipo and compensation expense related to the irr based pius was recorded at that time 
in conjunction with the ipo  the pius were exchanged for a combination of vested and unvested common shares and vested and unvested stock options 
the equity instruments issued in exchange for pius included  vested common shares  unvested common shares  vested stock options  unvested stock options the unvested instruments corresponded to the unvested time based pius and continue to vest according to the original vesting schedule of such time based pius 
the remainder of these instruments will vest in at the time of the ipo  we recorded additional compensation expense of approximately million related to the vesting of the irr based pius and the adjustment of the fair value of the vested portion of time based pius 
fair value of the pius at the date of the ipo was measured based on the fair value of the common shares and options for which they were exchanged 
the common shares were valued at the ipo price of the options have an exercise price of and had a weighted average fair value at the date issued of 
fair value of the options was estimated using a black scholes option pricing model incorporating the following weighted average assumptions expected volatility of expected dividend yield of expected term of years risk free interest rate of occupancy and equipment occupancy and equipment expense increased by million or for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  and decreased by approximately million  or on an annualized basis for the year ended december  as compared to the period ended december  the increase in occupancy and equipment expense for the year ended december  related primarily to the expansion of our branch network 
the decline in occupancy and equipment expense for the year ended december  resulted primarily from renegotiation of leases 
oreo and foreclosure related expenses and losses at december  as well as during the years ended december  and and the period ended december   all of our oreo properties were covered by the loss sharing agreements with the fdic 
therefore  oreo losses are substantially offset by non interest income related to indemnification by the fdic 
generally  oreo and foreclosure related expenses are also reimbursed under the terms of the loss sharing agreements with the fdic 
oreo expense  foreclosure expense and impairment of oreo remained at high levels during the years ended december  and and the period ended december  due to continuing deterioration in home prices in our primary market areas and the high volume of foreclosure activity 
liquidation of oreo properties in a market with deteriorating values contributed to increased losses 
table of contents on sales of oreo in at december   approximately  units were in the foreclosure pipeline  down from approximately  units at december  and a peak of approximately  units in november of increased foreclosure expense for the year ended december  as compared to the period ended december  reflects the cost of liquidation of the high number of properties in the pipeline at the end of the decline in foreclosure expense for the year ended december  corresponds to the declining number of units in the pipeline 
the number of units in oreo increased from at the end of to  at the end of and then declined to at the end of these trends are reflected in the decline in oreo expense for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  and in the increase in oreo expense for the year ended december  as compared to the period ended december  we have performed an internal assessment of our foreclosure practices and procedures and of our vendor management processes related to outside vendors that assist us in the foreclosure process 
this assessment did not reveal any deficiencies in processes and procedures that we believe to be of significance 
other components of non interest expense for the period ended december   non interest expense included two significant non recurring items 
the first of these was the write off of a receivable from the fdic in the amount of million  which was established at the date of the acquisition and related to the disputed valuation of certain acquired investment securities 
given that the disagreement over the valuation extended past december  with the likelihood that no additional consideration would be paid  the receivable was written off in subsequently  the company reached a settlement with the fdic regarding this dispute 
under the settlement  the company received million  which was reflected in non interest income in the fourth quarter of the second of these non recurring items was million in direct costs associated with the acquisition  consisting primarily of legal and investment banking advisory fees 
other non interest expense for the year ended december  and the period ended december  included the increase in value of a warrant issued to the fdic in conjunction with the acquisition 
based on its initial terms  the value of the warrant  as defined  was based on the value the company realized in an ipo or exit event 
we utilized third party valuation specialists to assist in the determination of the fair value of the warrant at acquisition and at each quarter end beginning with september  through september  the warrant was initially recorded with a fair value of million at may  in october  the company and the fdic amended the warrant to guarantee a minimum value to the fdic in the amount of million 
during the year ended december  and the period ended december   we recorded million and million  respectively  of non interest expense reflecting the increase in the value of the warrant which  at december   was adjusted to the guaranteed minimum value 
in february   the company redeemed the fdic warrant for its agreed upon value of million in cash 
deposit insurance expense declined by million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  and by million on an annualized basis for the year ended december  as compared to the period ended december  in  the fdic revised the assessment base for deposit insurance premiums 
the change in the assessment base coupled with the relatively low risk rating assigned to the bank resulted in a reduction of the bank s premiums 
the decline in deposit insurance expense on an annualized basis for the year ended december  as compared to the period ended december  primarily resulted from a decline in deposits 
professional fees increased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  primarily due to legal and other professional fees incurred in 
table of contents conjunction with the acquisition of herald 
professional fees declined by million on an annualized basis for the year ended december  as compared to the period ended december  the period ended december  included non recurring legal and accounting fees related to certain litigation matters and formation of the company 
the primary components of other non interest expense are advertising and promotion  the cost of regulatory examinations  insurance  travel and general office expense 
period over period increases in other non interest expense relate to general organic growth of our business 
income taxes the provision for income taxes for the years ended december  and and the period ended december  was million  million and million  respectively 
the company s effective tax rate was  and for the years ended december  and and the period ended december   respectively 
the company s effective tax rate differed from the statutory federal tax rate of primarily due to non deductible equity based compensation expense  the effect of state income taxes and for the year ended december   the provision for uncertain state tax positions 
non deductible equity based compensation totaled million  million and million for the years ended december  and and the period ended december   respectively 
non deductible expense related primarily to pius and the equity instruments for which pius were exchanged at the time of the ipo 
we expect non deductible equity based compensation to continue to impact the effective tax rate  but to a lesser extent  in as unrecognized compensation cost related to these equity instruments continues to decline 
based on the nature of equity instruments currently outstanding  we expect the impact of non deductible compensation expense on the effective tax rate to be immaterial for periods after at december  and  the company had net deferred tax assets of million and million  respectively 
at december   the company had net deferred tax liabilities of million 
based on an evaluation of both positive and negative evidence related to ultimate realization of deferred tax assets  we have concluded it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
persuasive positive evidence leading to this conclusion as of december  includes the availability of sufficient tax loss carrybacks and future taxable income resulting from reversal of existing taxable temporary differences to assure realization of the deferred tax assets 
realization of deferred tax assets as of december  is not dependent on the generation of additional future taxable income 
for more information  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
analysis of financial condition for the post acquisition periods average interest earning assets increased million to billion for the year ended december  from billion for the year ended december  this increase was driven primarily by growth in the average balance of investment securities of million resulting from continued deployment of cash generated by loan resolutions and reimbursements under the loss sharing agreements 
the average balance of loans declined by million  largely due to continued resolution of covered loans  significantly offset by growth in the new loan portfolio 
average non interest earning assets declined by million  primarily because of the reduction in the fdic indemnification asset for claims paid 

table of contents average interest bearing liabilities decreased by million to billion for the year ended december  from billion for the year ended december   reflecting primarily a decrease in average interest bearing deposits of million 
the reduction in outstanding interest bearing deposits resulted from a continued shift in emphasis away from rate sensitive time deposits 
average non interest bearing liabilities increased by million  primarily as a result of an increase of million in non interest bearing demand deposits 
average equity increased by million 
average equity was impacted by proceeds from the ipo  earnings and equity based compensation  partially offset by dividends paid

investment securities increased by billion  to billion at december  from billion at december  and by million to billion at december  from billion at december  growth of the investment portfolio has been driven primarily by the deployment of cash generated by loan resolution activity and submission of claims to the fdic under the loss sharing agreements into higher yielding assets during a period of diminished loan demand 
our investment strategy has focused on providing liquidity necessary for day to day operations  adding a suitable balance of high credit quality  diversifying assets to the consolidated balance sheet  managing interest rate risk  and generating acceptable returns given our established risk parameters 
we have sought to maintain liquidity and manage interest rate risk by investing a significant portion of the portfolio in high quality liquid securities consisting primarily of us government agency floating rate residential mortgage backed securities 
we have also invested in highly rated structured products including private label residential and commercial mortgage backed securities and re remics  bank preferred stocks  us small business administration securities and non mortgage asset backed securities collateralized primarily by auto loans  credit card receivables  student loans  floor plan loans  servicer advances and small balance commercial loans that  while somewhat less liquid  provide us with

the credit quality of the investment portfolio remained strong at december  as of december   of the non covered securities were backed by us government agencies or sponsored enterprises or were rated aaa 
there were two non covered securities with a fair value of million that were unrated  the remaining non covered securities were investment grade 
the investment portfolio was in a net unrealized gain position of million at december  with aggregate fair value equal to of amortized cost 
net unrealized gains included million of gross unrealized gains and million of gross unrealized losses 
securities in unrealized loss positions for months or more had an aggregate fair value of million  representing only of the fair value of the portfolio  with total unrealized losses of million at december  
table of contents we evaluate the credit quality of individual securities in the portfolio quarterly to determine whether any of the investments in unrealized loss positions are other than temporarily impaired 
this evaluation considers but is not necessarily limited to the following factors  the relative significance of which varies depending on the circumstances pertinent to each individual security our intent to hold the security until maturity or for a period of time sufficient for a recovery in value  whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than amortized cost  adverse changes in expected cash flows  available information about the value and performance of underlying collateral  the payment structure of the security  including levels of subordination or over collateralization  the general market condition of the geographic area or industry of the issuer  the issuer s financial condition  performance and business prospects  and credit ratings of issuers and individual securities 
no securities were determined to be other than temporarily impaired during the years ended december  or or the period ended december  the majority of the unrealized losses in the portfolio at december  were driven by widening spreads on private label re remics and non mortgage asset backed securities  particularly student loan backed securities  in the fourth quarter of to a lesser extent  unrealized losses resulted from widening spreads on gnma hecm securities and private label mortgage backed securities as well as market conditions impacting the value of financial institution preferred stocks 
we believe all of these factors to be consistent with temporary impairment 
we do not intend to sell securities in unrealized loss positions  and have not sold any such securities subsequent to december  based on an assessment of our liquidity position and internal and regulatory guidelines for permissible investments and concentrations  it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell securities in unrealized loss positions prior to recovery of amortized cost basis 
the severity and duration of impairment of individual securities in the portfolio is generally not material 
the timely repayment of principal and interest on us government agency securities in unrealized loss positions is explicitly guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the us government 
management engaged a third party to perform projected cash flow analyses of the private label mortgage backed securities  re remics and non mortgage asset backed securities  incorporating cusip level collateral default rate  voluntary prepayment rate  severity and delinquency assumptions 
based on the results of this analysis  no credit losses were projected 
given the expectation of timely repayment of principal and interest and the limited duration and severity of impairment  we concluded that none of the debt securities were other than temporarily impaired 
given the results of our analysis of the financial condition and business prospects of the underlying issuers and the limited duration and severity of impairment  we considered the impairment of the equity securities to be temporary 
for further discussion of our analysis of investment securities for otti  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we use third party pricing services to assist us in estimating the fair value of investment securities 
we perform a variety of procedures to insure that we have a thorough understanding of the methodologies and assumptions used by the pricing services including obtaining and reviewing written documentation of the methods and assumptions employed  conducting interviews with valuation desk 
table of contents personnel  performing on site walkthroughs and reviewing model results and detailed assumptions used to value selected securities as considered necessary 
our classification of prices within the fair value hierarchy is based on an evaluation of the nature of the significant assumptions impacting the valuation of each type of security in the portfolio 
we have established a robust price challenge process that includes a review by our treasury front office of all prices provided on a monthly basis 
any price evidencing unexpected month over month fluctuations or deviations from our expectations based on recent observed trading activity and other information available in the marketplace that would impact the value of the security is challenged 
responses to the price challenges  which generally include specific information about inputs and assumptions incorporated in the valuation and their sources  are reviewed in detail 
if considered necessary to resolve any discrepancies  a price will be obtained from an additional independent valuation specialist 
we do not typically adjust the prices provided  other than through this established challenge process 
our primary pricing services utilize observable inputs when available  and employ unobservable inputs and propriety models only when observable inputs are not available 
as a matter of course  the services validate prices by comparison to recent trading activity whenever such activity exists 
quotes obtained from the pricing services are typically non binding 
we have also established a quarterly price validation process whereby we verify the prices provided by our primary pricing service for a sample of securities in the portfolio 
sample sizes vary based on the type of security being priced  with higher sample sizes applied to more difficult to value security types 
verification procedures may consist of obtaining prices from an additional outside source or internal modeling  generally based on intex 
we have established acceptable percentage deviations from the price provided by the initial pricing source 
if deviations fall outside the established parameters  we will obtain and evaluate more detailed information about the assumptions and inputs used by each pricing source  or  if considered necessary  employ an additional valuation specialist to price the security in question 
when there are price discrepancies  the final determination of fair value is based on careful consideration of the assumptions and inputs employed by each of the pricing sources given our knowledge of the market for each individual security and may include interviews with the outside pricing sources utilized 
depending on the results of the validation process  sample sizes may be extended for particular classes of securities 
results of the validation process are reviewed by the treasury front office and by senior management 
the majority of our investment securities are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy 
certain preferred stocks are classified within level of the hierarchy 
at december   of our investment securities were classified within level of the fair value hierarchy as compared to of the portfolio at december  securities classified within level of the hierarchy at december  included primarily private label residential mortgage backed securities and certain non mortgage asset backed securities 
the non mortgage asset backed securities consist of securities backed by servicer advances  small balance commercial loans  older vintage student loans and franchise product sub tranches 
these securities were classified within level of the hierarchy because proprietary credit related assumptions related to default probabilities and loss severities were considered significant to the valuation 
at december   re remics were also classified within level of the hierarchy 
these securities were classified within level of the hierarchy at december  market activity for these securities has increased  valuation at december  was primarily spread driven and proprietary credit related assumptions no longer had a significant impact on pricing

covered loans are declining and new loans increasing as a percentage of the total portfolio as covered loans are repaid or resolved and new loan originations and purchases increase 
this trend is expected to continue 
covered loans may be further broken out into two broad categories i aci loans and ii non aci loans

table of contents residential mortgages residential mortgages  including single family residential mortgages and home equity loans and lines of credit  have historically represented the majority of the total loan portfolio  although  consistent with our strategy of emphasizing commercial loan production  this portfolio segment is declining as a percentage of total loans 
residential mortgages constituted of total new loans and of total acquired loans at december  residential mortgages totaled billion  or of total loans and billion  or of total loans at december  and  respectively 
the decline in this portfolio segment  both in total and as a percentage of loans  is primarily a result of the resolution of covered loans  including transfers to oreo 
we expect residential loans to continue to decline as a percentage of total loans 
the new residential loan portfolio includes both loans originated and purchased since the acquisition 
we currently originate single family residential mortgage loans with terms ranging from to years  with either fixed or adjustable interest rates  primarily to customers in the state of florida 
new residential mortgage loans are primarily closed end first lien loans for the purchase or re finance of owner occupied property 
at december  and  million or and million or  respectively of our new single family residential loans were originated loans  million or and million or of our new single family residential loans were purchased loans 
we have purchased loans to supplement our mortgage origination platform and to geographically diversify our loan portfolio given the current credit environment and limited demand for non agency mortgage product in florida 
the number of newly originated residential mortgage loans that are refinancings of covered loans is not significant 
home equity loans and lines of credit are not significant to the new loan portfolio 
the residential portfolio contains option adjustable rate mortgage  arm  no doc or reduced doc and wholesale production loans originated by the failed bank prior to the acquisition 
subsequent to the acquisition  we shut down the broker origination channel of the failed bank and are no longer originating or purchasing these types of products 
all of these loans are covered loans  therefore  the company s exposure to future losses on these mortgage loans is mitigated by the loss sharing agreements as well as by the fair value basis recorded in these loans resulting from the application of acquisition accounting 
the covered loan portfolio includes loans which have been modified by us under the us treasury department s home affordable modification program  or hamp

commercial real estate loans include term loans secured by owner and non owner occupied income producing properties including rental apartments  industrial properties  retail shopping centers  office buildings  warehouses and hotels as well as real estate secured lines of credit 
loans secured by commercial real estate typically have shorter repayment periods and re price more frequently than single family residential loans 
the company s underwriting standards generally provide for loan terms of five years  with amortization schedules of no more than twenty five years 
loan to value  or ltv  ratios are typically limited to no more than 
in addition  the company usually obtains personal guarantees of the principals as additional security for most commercial real estate loans 
commercial loans are typically made to growing companies and middle market businesses and include equipment loans  working capital lines of credit  asset backed loans  acquisition finance credit facilities  lease financing and small business administration product offerings 
these loans may be structured as term loans  typically with maturities of five years or less  or revolving lines of credit which typically mature annually 
lease financing consists primarily of municipal equipment leases originated by pinnacle public finance

table of contents asset quality in discussing asset quality  a distinction must be made between covered loans and new loans 
new loans were underwritten under significantly different and generally more conservative standards than the covered loans 
in particular  credit approval policies have been strengthened  wholesale mortgage origination channels have been eliminated  no doc and option arm loan products have been eliminated  and real estate appraisal policies have been improved 
although the risk profile of covered loans is higher than that of new loans  our exposure to loss related to the covered loans is significantly mitigated by the loss sharing agreements and by the fair value basis recorded in these loans resulting from the application of acquisition accounting 
we recognize that developing and maintaining a strong credit culture is paramount to our success 
we have established a robust credit risk management framework and put in place an experienced team to lead the workout and recovery process for the commercial and commercial real estate portfolios 
we have also implemented a dedicated internal loan review function that reports directly to our audit committee 
we have an experienced resolution team in place for covered residential mortgage loans  and have implemented outsourcing arrangements with industry leading firms in certain areas such as oreo resolution 
loan performance is monitored by our credit administration  workout and recovery and loan review departments 
commercial loans are regularly reviewed by our internal loan review department 
relationships with committed balances greater than  are reviewed at least annually 
the company utilizes an internal asset risk classification system as part of its efforts to monitor and improve commercial asset quality 
loans exhibiting potential credit weaknesses that deserve management s close attention and that if left uncorrected may result in deterioration of the repayment capacity of the borrower are categorized as special mention 
these borrowers may exhibit negative financial trends or erratic financial performance  strained liquidity  marginal collateral coverage  declining industry trends or weak management 
loans with well defined credit weaknesses that may result in a loss if the deficiencies are not corrected are assigned a risk rating of substandard 
these borrowers may exhibit payment defaults  insufficient cash flows  operating losses  negative financial trends  or declining collateral values 
loans with weaknesses so severe that collection in full is highly questionable or improbable  but because of certain reasonably specific pending factors have not been charged off  are assigned risk ratings of doubtful 
residential mortgage loans are not individually risk rated 
delinquency status is the primary measure we use to monitor the credit quality of these loans 
non covered loans at december   forty seven non covered commercial loans with an aggregate balance of million were rated special mention and forty three non covered commercial loans totaling million were classified substandard or doubtful 
at december   twenty non covered commercial loans aggregating million were rated special mention and twelve non covered commercial loans aggregating million were classified substandard 
at december   no new single family residential loans were days or more past due 
new single family residential loans past due less than days totaled million at december   this population consisted primarily of eighteen purchased loans with missed payments due on december  home equity loans and lines of credit in the new loan portfolio that were days or more past due totaled thousand 
substantially all of the home equity loans and lines of credit in the new portfolio are first liens 
there were no delinquencies in the new residential mortgage or home equity loan portfolios as of december  
table of contents the majority of our new residential mortgage portfolio consists of purchased loans 
the credit parameters for purchasing loans are similar to the underwriting guidelines in place for our mortgage origination platform 
for purchasing seasoned loans  good payment history is required 
in general  we purchase performing jumbo mortgage pools which have average fico scores above  primarily are owner occupied and full documentation  and have a current ltv less than 
we perform due diligence on the purchased loans for credit  compliance  counterparty  payment history and property valuation 
at december   the purchased loan portfolio had the following characteristics were fixed rate loans  were full documentation and had an average fico score of and average ltv of 
the majority of this portfolio was owner occupied  with primary residence and second homes or investment properties 
in terms of vintage  of the portfolio was originated pre  in  in  in  in and in similarly  the originated loan portfolio had the following characteristics at december  were fixed rate loans  were full documentation and had an average fico score of and average ltv of 
the majority of this portfolio was owner occupied  with primary residence and second home 
in terms of vintage  of the portfolio was originated in  in and in delinquent consumer loans in the new portfolio were insignificant as of december  and covered loans covered loans consist of both aci loans and non aci loans 
at december   covered aci loans totaled billion and covered non aci loans totaled million  net of unearned discounts and deferred fees and costs 
residential covered residential loans were placed into homogenous pools at acquisition and the ongoing credit quality and performance of these loans is monitored on a pool basis 
at acquisition  the fair value of the pools was measured based on the expected cash flows to be derived from each pool 
initial cash flow expectations incorporated significant assumptions regarding prepayment rates  frequency of default and loss severity 
for aci pools  the difference between total contractual payments due and the cash flows expected to be received at acquisition was recognized as non accretable difference 
the excess of expected cash flows over the recorded fair value of each aci pool at acquisition  known as the accretable yield  is being recognized as interest income over the life of each pool 
we monitor the pools quarterly to determine whether any significant changes have occurred in expected cash flows that would be indicative of impairment or necessitate reclassification between non accretable difference and accretable yield 
generally  improvements in expected cash flows less than of the expected cash flows from a pool are not recorded 
this materiality threshold may be revised as we gain greater experience 
generally  commercial and commercial real estate loans are monitored individually due to their size and other unique characteristics 
residential mortgage loans  including home equity loans  comprised of the upb of the acquired loan portfolio at the acquisition date 
we performed a detailed analysis of the portfolio to determine the key loan characteristics influencing performance 
key characteristics influencing the performance of the residential portfolio were determined to be delinquency status  product type  in particular  amortizing as opposed to option arm products  current indexed ltv ratio  and original fico score 
the aci loans in the residential mortgage portfolio were grouped into ten homogenous static pools based on these characteristics  and the non aci residential loans were grouped into two homogenous static pools 
there were other variables which we initially expected to have a significant 
table of contents influence on performance and which were considered in our analysis  however  the results of our analysis demonstrated that their impact was less significant after controlling for current indexed ltv  product type  and fico score 
therefore  these additional factors were not used in grouping the covered residential loans into pools and are not used in monitoring ongoing asset quality of the pools 
the factors we considered but determined not to be significant included the level and type of documentation required at origination  ie  whether a loan was originated under full documentation  reduced documentation  or no documentation programs  occupancy  defined as owner occupied vs 
non owner occupied collateral properties  geography  and vintage  ie  year of origination 
at december   the carrying value of single family residential non aci loans was million  million or of these loans were days or more past due and million or were days or more past due 
at december   aci single family residential loans totaled billion 
million or of these loans were delinquent by days or more and million or were delinquent by days or more 
at december   non aci home equity loans and lines of credit had an aggregate carrying value of million  million or of these loans were days or more past due and million or were days or more past due 
aci home equity loans and lines of credit had a carrying amount of million at december  at december   million or of aci home equity loans and lines of credit were days or more contractually delinquent and million or were delinquent by days or more 
at december  and  respectively  of the non aci and aci home equity loans and lines of credit are first liens while and  respectively  of the non aci and aci home equity loans and lines of credit are second or third liens 
expected loss severity given default is significantly higher for home equity loans that are not first liens 
although delinquencies in the covered residential portfolio are high  potential future losses to the company related to these loans are significantly mitigated by the loss sharing agreements 
commercial the ongoing asset quality of significant commercial and commercial real estate loans is monitored on an individual basis through our regular credit review and risk rating process 
we believe internal risk rating is the best indicator of the credit quality of commercial loans 
homogenous groups of smaller balance commercial loans may be monitored collectively 
at december   non aci commercial loans had an aggregate upb of million and a carrying value  net of discounts of million  of these loans were rated pass and this portfolio segment has limited delinquency history 
at december   eleven loans with a carrying value totaling million were rated special mention  forty six loans with a carrying value totaling million were rated substandard and loans with a carrying value of million were rated doubtful 
at december   aci commercial loans had a carrying value of million  of which million are covered under the loss sharing agreements 
at december   loans with carrying values of million  million and million were internally risk rated special mention  substandard and doubtful  respectively 
potential future losses to the company related to the covered aci loans are significantly mitigated by the loss sharing agreements 

table of contents impaired loans and non performing assets non performing assets consist of i non accrual loans  including loans that have been restructured in troubled debt restructurings tdrs and placed on nonaccrual status or that have not yet exhibited a consistent six month payment history since modification  ii accruing loans that are more than days contractually past due as to interest or principal  excluding aci loans  and iii oreo 
impaired loans also include loans modified in tdrs that are performing according to their modified terms and aci loans for which expected cash flows have been revised downward since acquisition 
because of discount accretion  these aci loans have not been classified as nonaccrual loans and we do not consider them to be non performing assets 
as of december   and  substantially all of the non performing loans and all of the oreo were covered assets 
the company s exposure to loss related to covered assets is significantly mitigated by the loss sharing agreements with the fdic and by the fair value basis recorded in these assets resulting from the application of acquisition accounting 
non performing loans at december  included twenty seven new commercial loans with an aggregate balance of million and new residential loans totaling thousand 
at december  non performing loans included five new commercial loans with balances totaling million 
there were no non performing new commercial loans at december  at december  and  there were no non performing new residential loans

at december   and  substantially all of the nonaccrual loans are non aci loans 
contractually delinquent aci loans are not reflected as nonaccrual loans because discount continues to be accreted 
discount accretion continues to be recorded as there continues to be an expectation of future cash flows in excess of carrying amount from these loans 
the carrying value of aci loans contractually delinquent by more than days but still accruing was million  million and billion at december   and  respectively 
the decline in the ratio of non performing assets to total assets at december  as compared to december  is primarily attributable to the decrease in oreo 
the decline in the ratio of the alll to total loans and to non performing loans resulted from the recovery of provision for aci loans attributable to improvements in expected cash flows from those loans 
non performing assets reported for the post acquisition periods are substantially lower than non performing assets for the pre acquisition periods primarily due to the recording of these assets at their fair values in conjunction with the application of acquisition accounting and the fact that aci 
table of contents loans are no longer reflected as nonaccrual loans as discussed above 
the lower ratio of the alll to total loans at dates subsequent to the acquisition is a direct result of the fact that no allowance was initially recorded with respect to the acquired loans 
rather  the estimated fair value at which these loans were initially recorded incorporated significant assumptions related to credit quality and default probabilities 
due to the foregoing factors  the ratios presented in the table above may lack comparability to those of our peers 
except for aci loans  commercial loans are placed on nonaccrual status when i management has determined that full payment of all contractual principal and interest is in doubt  or ii the loan is past due days or more as to principal and or interest  unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
residential loans are placed on nonaccrual status when there is days of interest due and uncollected 
residential loans are returned to accrual status when less than days of interest is due and unpaid 
commercial loans are returned to accruing status only after all past due principal and interest has been collected 
except for aci loans accounted for in pools  loans that are the subject of troubled debt restructurings are generally placed on nonaccrual status at the time of the modification unless the borrower has no history of missed payments for six months prior to the restructuring 
if borrowers perform pursuant to the modified loan terms for at least six months and the remaining loan balances are considered collectable  the loans are returned to accrual status 
a loan modification is considered a tdr if the company  for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower s financial difficulties  grants a concession to the borrower that the company would not otherwise grant 
these concessions may take the form of temporarily or permanently reduced interest rates  payment abatement periods  extensions of maturity  or in some cases  partial forgiveness of principal 
under generally accepted accounting principles  modified aci loans accounted for in pools are not accounted for as troubled debt restructurings and are not separated from their respective pools when modified 
as of december  there were five non aci commercial relationships with a total carrying value of thousand and one new commercial relationship with a balance of thousand that had been modified in tdrs 
additionally  at december  there were eleven non aci residential loans with a total carrying value of million that were the subject of hamp modifications and classified as tdrs 
no non aci or new loans were modified in tdrs during the year ended december  or the period ended december  at december   there were four aci commercial relationships with an aggregate carrying value of million that had been modified in tdrs 
as of december   there were three commercial aci relationships with a total carrying value of million that were the subject of tdrs 
additional interest income that would have been recognized on nonaccrual loans and tdrs had they performed in accordance with their original contractual terms is not material 
loss mitigation strategies although our exposure to loss on covered assets is mitigated by the loss sharing agreements  we have implemented strategies designed to minimize losses on these assets 
we have increased the quality and experience level of our workout and recovery and mortgage servicing departments 
we evaluate each loan in default to determine the most effective loss mitigation strategy  which may be modification  short sale  or foreclosure 
in  we began loan modifications under hamp for eligible borrowers in the residential portfolio 
hamp is a uniform loan modification process that provides eligible borrowers with sustainable monthly mortgage payments equal to a target of their gross monthly income 
as of december    borrowers had been counseled regarding their participation in hamp   of those borrowers were initially determined to be potentially eligible for loan modifications under the program 
as of december    borrowers who did not elect to participate in the program had been sent termination letters and  borrowers had been denied due to ineligibility 
at december   there were  permanent loan modifications and active trial modifications 

table of contents analysis of the allowance for loan and lease losses the alll relates to i new loans  ii estimated additional losses arising on non aci loans subsequent to the acquisition  and iii additional impairment recognized as a result of decreases in expected cash flows on aci loans due to further credit deterioration 
the impact of any additional provision for losses on covered loans is significantly mitigated by an increase in the fdic indemnification asset 
the determination of the amount of the alll is  by nature  highly complex and subjective 
future events that are inherently uncertain could result in material changes to the level of the alll 
general economic conditions such as unemployment rates  real estate values in our primary market areas and the level of interest rates  as well as a variety of other factors that affect the ability of borrowers businesses to generate cash flows sufficient to service their debts will impact the future performance of the portfolio 
new and non aci loans based on an analysis of historical performance of the non aci residential mortgage and home equity portfolio  oreo and short sale losses and recent trending data  we have concluded that ltv ratio is the leading predictive indicator of loss severity for this portfolio 
the non aci residential mortgage and home equity portfolios have therefore been divided into homogenous groups and stratified based on ltv for purposes of calculating the alll 
calculated frequency of roll to loss and severity percentages are applied to the dollar value of loans in each group to calculate an overall loss allowance 
ltv ratios at the individual loan level are updated quarterly using the appropriate case shiller quarterly msa home price index to adjust the original appraised value of the underlying collateral 
frequency is calculated for each pool using a four month roll to loss percentage  based on the assumption that if an event has occurred with a borrower that will ultimately result in a loss  this will manifest itself as a loan in default and in process of foreclosure within four months 
loss severity given default is estimated based on internal data about oreo sales and short sales from the portfolio 
the alll calculation incorporates a loss severity assumption for home equity loans at days delinquency 
due to the lack of similarity between the risk characteristics of new loans and covered loans in the residential and home equity portfolios  management does not believe it is appropriate to use the historical performance of the failed bank s residential mortgage portfolio as a basis for calculating the alll applicable to new loans 
the new loan portfolio is not seasoned and has not yet developed an observable loss trend 
therefore  the alll for new residential loans is based primarily on peer group average historical loss rates as discussed further below 
since the new loan portfolio is not yet seasoned enough to exhibit a loss trend and the non aci portfolio has limited delinquency history  the alll for new and non aci commercial loans is based primarily on the bank s internal credit risk rating system and peer group average historical loss rates by loan class 
the allowance is comprised of specific reserves for significant classified loans that are individually evaluated and determined to be impaired as well as general reserves for individually evaluated loans determined not to be impaired and loans that do not meet our established threshold for individual evaluation 
commercial relationships graded substandard or doubtful and on nonaccrual status with committed credit facilities greater than or equal to  are individually evaluated for impairment 
a quarterly net realizable value analysis is prepared for each of these relationships 
this analysis forms the basis for establishing specific reserves 
loans modified in tdrs are also evaluated individually for impairment 
we believe that loans rated substandard or doubtful that are not individually evaluated for impairment exhibit characteristics indicative of a heightened level of credit risk 
we group these loans by product type and performance status and establish general reserve percentages based on our analysis of the risks characterizing each group 
factors that impact our judgment as to the appropriate loss percentage to assign may include the underwriting criteria applied 
table of contents to a particular product type  whether the loans are secured or unsecured  the type of collateral  and delinquency status 
the peer group used to calculate the average historical loss rates that form the basis for our general reserve calculations is a group of banks in the southeast region determined by management to be the most comparable to bankunited 
factors that impacted the selection of the peer group included asset size  composition of the loan portfolio and credit quality ratios including net charge offs to average loans  alll to total loans  alll to noncurrent loans and noncurrent loans to total loans 
peer bank data was obtained from the statistics on depository institutions report published by the fdic for the most recent quarter available 
for new loans  a six quarter average of peer group historical loss rates was used as this period corresponds to the vintage of the majority of loans in this portfolio segment 
for the non aci portfolio  a twelve quarter average of peer group historical loss rates was used as this period is considered more representative of expected loss experience for the more seasoned loans in this segment 
our internal risk rating system comprises credit grades  grades through are pass grades 
the risk ratings are driven largely by debt service coverage 
peer group average historical loss rates are adjusted upward for loans rated special mention or assigned a lower pass rating 
peer group average historical loss rates are adjusted downward for loans assigned the highest pass grades 
in addition to the quantitative calculations described above  adjustments are made to the allowance for relevant qualitative factors when there is a material observable trend in those factors not already taken into account in the quantitative calculations 
qualitative factors that may result in an adjustment to the allowance have been grouped into four categories portfolio trends  policy and credit guidelines  economic factors  and credit concentrations 
at december   qualitative adjustments were made to historical loss percentages related to the current economic climate  portfolio trends and for certain classes of small business commercial loans  policy and credit guidelines 
adjustments related to the current economic climate were driven by uncertainty about general economic conditions including unemployment rates and real estate prices 
adjustments for portfolio trends related to the rapid growth rate of the new loan portfolio 
adjustments related to policy and credit guidelines impacted certain small business commercial loan products and related to the underwriting criteria applied to those particular products 
qualitative adjustments did not have a material impact on the alll as of december  prior to the fourth quarter of  we used the ots thrift industry charge off rates by asset type  annualized net charge off rates twelve quarter average for the southeast region the ots charge off rates rather than peer group historical loss rates in our determination of general reserve percentages 
particularly as the new loan portfolio has grown  we believe the peer group average loss rates are more representative of expected loss experience from our portfolio 
the transition to use of peer group historical loss rates did not have a material impact on the determination of the amount of the alll as of december  for non aci loans  the allowance is initially calculated based on upb 
the total of upb  less the calculated allowance  is then compared to the carrying amount of the loans  net of unamortized credit related fair value adjustments established at acquisition 
if the calculated balance net of the allowance is less than the carrying amount  an additional allowance is established 
any such increase in the allowance for non aci loans will result in a corresponding increase in the fdic indemnification asset 

table of contents aci loans for aci loans  a valuation allowance is established when periodic evaluations of expected cash flows reflect a decrease resulting from credit related factors from the level of cash flows that were estimated to be collected at acquisition plus any additional expected cash flows arising from revisions in those estimates 
we perform a quarterly analysis of expected cash flows for aci loans 
the analysis of expected cash flows for residential aci pools incorporates updated pool level expected prepayment rates  default rates  and delinquency levels  and loan level loss severity given default assumptions 
prepayment  delinquency and default curves used for this purpose are derived from roll rates generated from the historical performance of the aci residential loan portfolio observed over the immediately preceding four quarters 
given the static nature of the pools and unique characteristics of the loans  we believe that regularly updated historical information from the company s own portfolio is the best available indicator of future performance 
estimates of default probability and severity of loss given default also incorporate updated ltv ratios 
historic and projected values for the case shiller home price index for the relevant msa are utilized at the individual loan level to project current and future property values 
costs and fees represent an additional component of loss on default  and are projected using the making home affordable cost factors provided by the federal government 
our analysis at december  indicated a decrease in expected cash flows due to credit related assumptions related to two aci residential mortgage pools  therefore  a provision for loan losses of million was recorded  along with a corresponding increase in the fdic indemnification asset of million 
as of december   our analysis evidenced a significant improvement in expected cash flows related to these two aci residential pools and an offsetting decrease in expected cash flows due to credit related assumptions related to the aci home equity loan pool 
as a result  the million allowance established at december  related to aci residential pools  along with the increase in the fdic indemnification asset of million  was reversed  and a provision for loan losses of million  along with a corresponding increase in the fdic indemnification asset of million  was recorded related to the pooled home equity aci loans during the year ended december  due to improved performance of and projected cash flows from the home equity aci pool during  the allowance established related to this pool in  along with the corresponding increase in the fdic indemnification asset  were reversed in as a result  there is no valuation allowance related to aci residential and home equity pools at december  the primary assumptions underlying estimates of expected cash flows for aci commercial loans are default probability and severity of loss given default 
updated assumptions for large balance and delinquent loans in the commercial aci portfolio are based on net realizable value analyses prepared at the individual loan level by the company s workout and recovery department 
updated assumptions for smaller balance commercial loans are based on a combination of the company s own historical delinquency and severity data and industry level data 
delinquency data is used as a proxy for defaults as the company s experience has been that few of these loans return to performing status after being delinquent greater than days 
an additional multiplier is also applied in developing assumptions for loans rated special mention  substandard  or doubtful based on the company s historical loss experience with classified loans 
for the period ended december   there were no decreases in expected cash flows for commercial aci loans  therefore  no alll was provided related to these loans 
for the year ended december   our analysis indicated a decrease in expected cash flows from certain aci commercial loans evaluated individually for credit impairment  resulting in a provision for loan losses of million related to these aci loans 
an increase in the fdic indemnification asset of million was recorded related to this provision 
based on our loan level analysis of commercial aci loans for the year ended december  an additional provision for loan losses related to commercial aci loans of million was recorded 
an increase in the fdic indemnification asset of million was recorded related to this provision

results of operations for the pre acquisition periods the failed bank reported net losses of billion and million for the period from october  through may  and for the fiscal year ending september   or fiscal  respectively 
the net losses for the period ending may  and the fiscal year ending september  resulted primarily from severe deterioration in the failed bank s asset quality and the resultant reduction in net interest income  increase in the provision for loan losses  and impairment charges related to investment securities  oreo and mortgage servicing rights

table of contents increases and decreases in interest income and interest expense result from changes in average balances volume of interest earning assets and liabilities  as well as changes in average interest rates 
the comparison of total interest income and total interest expense for the period ending may  to the fiscal year ending september  is also impacted by the different number of days in the comparative periods 
the following table shows the effect that these factors had on the interest earned on the interest earning assets and the interest incurred on the interest bearing liabilities for the periods indicated 
the effect of changes in volume is determined by multiplying the change in volume by the previous period s average rate 
similarly  the effect of rate changes is calculated by multiplying the change in average rate by the previous period s volume

the decline in net interest income was comprised of a decline in interest income of million and a decline in interest expense of million 
on an annualized basis  net interest income for the period from october  through may  decreased by million or as compared with the year ending september  the decrease in net interest income was comprised of a decline in annualized interest income of million partially offset by a decline in annualized interest expense of million 
the decrease in interest income resulted primarily from an increase in non performing assets  evidenced by a decrease in the average yield on loans of basis points from for the year ending september  to for the period ending may  nonaccrual loans grew from billion at september  to billion at may  decreases in the average volume of 
table of contents both investment securities and loans outstanding and a decline in market rates on variable rate investment securities also contributed to the decline in interest income 
the decline in average volume of loans and investment securities resulted from the reduction in the scope of the failed bank s residential mortgage business and the size of the balance sheet in response to capital requirements and growth restrictions imposed by the ots 
the decline in interest expense resulted from lower rates paid on both deposits and fhlb advances  reflective of continued repricing of liabilities at lower market rates  partly offset by an increase in the average volume of outstanding interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest margin decreased by basis points from for the fiscal year ending september  to for the period ending may  while the interest rate spread declined by basis points from to 
the primary driver of the decline in net interest margin and interest rate spread was the increase in non performing assets 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses recorded by the failed bank was million and million for the period from october  through may  and the fiscal year ending september   respectively 
the increases in the provision for the period ending may  and the fiscal year ending september  largely reflected severe deterioration in the residential housing market  particularly in florida and california 
total non performing loans were billion  or  of total loans at may  net charge offs totaled million for the period from october  to may  and million for the fiscal year ending september  the majority of charge offs were concentrated in the single family residential portfolio 
non interest income loss the failed bank reported a non interest loss of million for the period from october  to may  and a non interest loss of million for the fiscal year ending september  the following table presents a comparison of the categories of non interest income loss for the periods indicated dollars in thousands period from october  to may  fiscal year ended september  service charges on deposits and other fee income service charges on loans loan servicing fees impairment and amortization of mortgage servicing rights net gain loss on sale of investment securities net gain loss on sale and writedown of loans held for sale other than temporary impairment of securities available for sale fees received from bankunited financial corporation other non interest income total non interest income loss 
table of contents period from october  to may  compared to the fiscal year ending september  the non interest loss for the period from october  to may  was largely driven by additional impairment charges on securities available for sale and mortgage servicing rights 
see the section entitled investment securities available for sale below for further discussion of impairment charges related to investment securities 
the impairment of mortgage servicing assets resulted primarily from termination of the failed bank s rights to service loans for the federal national mortgage association fannie mae  or fnma  and the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac  or fhlmc  during the period ending may  a continued decline in secondary market mortgage activity led to a reduced gain loss on sale of loans for the period ending may  the reduction in other non interest income resulted primarily from an adjustment to outstanding mortgage insurance claims receivable 
non interest expense the following table presents the components of non interest expense for the periods indicated dollars in thousands period from october  to may  fiscal year ended september  employee compensation and benefits occupancy and equipment oreo expense impairment of oreo professional fees foreclosure expense deposit insurance expense telecommunications and data processing other non interest expense total non interest expense non interest expense as a percentage of average assets increased to annualized for the period ended may  from for the fiscal year ending september  the primary drivers of increasing non interest expense over this period were increased impairment of oreo  higher oreo expense  foreclosure expense and the deposit insurance expense 
period from october  to may  compared to the fiscal year ending september  on an annualized basis  employee compensation and benefits as a percentage of average assets remained consistent over the period ending may  and the fiscal year ending september  the total decline in employee compensation and benefits expense of million or approximately on an annualized basis was primarily a result of an approximate reduction in the failed bank s wholesale residential lending staff and other reductions in the workforce 
oreo expense  foreclosure expense and impairment of oreo continued to increase during the period ending may  due to further deterioration in home prices and the increasing volume of foreclosures 
as of may   there were slightly over  units in the foreclosure process as compared to approximately  units at september  deposit insurance expense was significantly impacted by additional assessments by the fdic during the period ending may  
table of contents income taxes for the period ending may  and the fiscal year ending september   the failed bank recorded an income tax provision benefit of and million  respectively 
the failed bank s effective tax rate for the period ending may  and the fiscal year ending september  was and  respectively 
the effective tax rate varied from the federal statutory tax rate of primarily due to state income taxes and the valuation allowance established related to deferred tax assets 
the failed bank had net deferred tax assets  prior to any valuation allowance  of million at may  balance sheet analysis for the pre acquisition periods average total assets of the failed bank declined by million to billion for the period ending may  from billion for the fiscal year ended september  this decline related primarily to the decline in average loans  which was fueled by increased impairments and foreclosures during the period combined with normal paydowns and a curtailment in lending activity 
average total liabilities increased by million to billion for the period ending may  from billion for the fiscal year ending september  average deposits increased by billion  offset by a million decline in average outstanding borrowings

during the period from october  through may   the failed bank recognized other than temporary impairment charges of million  consisting of million related to subordinate tranches of the failed bank s mortgage securitization the securities  million related to private label collateralized mortgage obligations cmos  million related to trust preferred securities  million related to fnma and fhlmc preferred stock and million related to a mutual fund 
the majority of the impairment charges recorded during the period ending may  represented further deterioration in value of securities for which other than temporary impairment charges were initially recorded in fiscal as discussed below 
additional impairment of the securities and private label cmos was reflective of further deterioration in projected cash flows from the underlying collateral resulting from increasing frequency and severity of defaults 
recognition of other than temporary impairment of pooled trust preferred 
table of contents securities was based on a third party discounted cash flow analysis incorporating proprietary collateral default rate assumptions that indicated less than full recovery of principal  as well as consideration of the severity and duration of impairment 
other than temporary impairment of fnma and fhlmc preferred stock was based on further deterioration in the market price of these securities coupled with lack of evidence of improvement in the financial condition of the issuers 
cash flow analysis incorporating updated underlying collateral default assumptions led to further other than temporary impairment of the mutual fund investment 
during the fiscal year ending september   the failed bank recorded other than temporary impairment charges totaling million  including million relating to the securities  million relating to private label cmos  million relating to fnma and fhlmc preferred stocks  million relating to a mutual fund  and million relating to other debt securities 
the determination that unrealized losses on the securities were other than temporary was based on an analysis of discounted expected future cash flows using third party developed models that incorporated proprietary behavioral assumptions about collateral default rates  loss severity levels and voluntary annual prepayment rates 
cash flow projections for the underlying mortgages  given current loss trends  indicated that projected losses could completely erode the value of certain subordinate classes and significantly erode the value of several other subordinate classes of the securitization  leading to the determination that these securities were other than temporarily impaired 
management s determination that certain other private label cmos were other than temporarily impaired was also based on the analysis of discounted expected future cash flows 
the magnitude and duration of unrealized losses was considered in these determinations as well 
as a result of significant declines in value of fnma and fhlmc preferred stock after these entities were placed into conservatorship on september   the cost basis of these investments was well in excess of the market price of the stock at september  the determination that impairment of these securities was other than temporary was based on the severity of impairment and uncertainty about the potential for market recovery of the issuers 
the mutual fund determined to be other than temporarily impaired was a fund that invested primarily in mortgage related investments  the majority of which were subordinate securities with increasing levels of underlying collateral delinquencies and defaults 
the severity of impairment combined with the high probability of significant principal loss of the underlying collateral led to the conclusion that the security was other than temporarily impaired 
the other debt securities consisted of pooled trust preferred securities  collateralized by subordinated debt issued by financial institutions 
management s determination that these securities were other than temporarily impaired was based on an analysis of projected collateral cash flows

total originations of residential loans were million for the period ending may  the failed bank also terminated its option arm and reduced documentation loan programs during fiscal originations of option arm loans totaled million for fiscal and billion for fiscal  representing and  respectively  of total residential loan originations 
option arm loans generally started with a below market incentive interest rate that adjusted to an applicable index rate plus a defined margin after a specified period of time 
each month  the borrower had the option to make one of several payments  including a minimum payment that may not have covered the interest accrued on the loan for the month  resulting in the deferred

the increase in total non performing assets to billion at may  resulted directly from the economic downturn  both nationally and in the failed bank s primary geographic markets  particularly the precipitous decline in housing prices 
non performing loans were concentrated in the option arm portfolio  and a significant percentage of the non performing loans were those with higher ltv ratios  originated during periods of historically high housing prices

other assets goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill of million at may  arose from previous business combinations entered into by the failed bank 
goodwill impairment tests were performed as of may  as of may   the carrying value of the reporting unit to which goodwill was assigned was negative  therefore  the first phase of the goodwill impairment test was passed and no impairment of goodwill was recorded 
based on this comparison  the implied fair value of goodwill exceeded its carrying amount  therefore  no impairment was indicated 
other assets other assets totaled million at may  the most significant components of the decrease in other assets from september  to may  were a million decline in mortgage servicing rights arising from impairment charges  and a million decline in accrued interest receivable attributable primarily to the decline in total loans outstanding and the increase in non performing loans

bankunited must get approval by the federal reserve bank to pay dividends to its parent 
applications have been filed with the federal reserve bank and  previously the ots since the third quarter of all quarterly dividend requests have been approved 
pursuant to fdicia  the occ and fdic have adopted regulations setting forth a five tier system for measuring the capital adequacy of the financial institutions they supervise 
at december  and december   bankunited had capital levels that exceeded the well capitalized guidelines 
in addition  a condition of approval of bankunited s application for federal deposit insurance requires bankunited to maintain a tier leverage ratio at no less than eight percent throughout the first three years of operation 
to date  bankunited has exceeded that requirement 

table of contents liquidity involves the company s ability to raise funds to support asset growth or reduce assets to meet deposit withdrawals and other borrowing needs  to maintain reserve requirements and to otherwise operate the company on an ongoing basis 
the company s liquidity needs are primarily met by growth in transaction deposit accounts  its cash position and cash flow from its amortizing investment and loan portfolios and reimbursements under the shared loss agreements 
if necessary  the bank has the ability to raise liquidity through collateralized borrowings  fhlb advances  or the sale of its available for sale investment portfolio 
the company s alco policy has established several measures of liquidity which are reviewed monthly by alco and quarterly by the company s board of directors 
the primary measurement of liquidity used by the company is liquid assets defined as cash and cash equivalents  and pledgeable securities to total assets 
the company s liquidity is considered acceptable if liquid assets divided by total assets exceeds 
at december   the company s liquid assets divided by total assets was 
in addition  the company monitors a one year liquidity ratio  defined as cash and cash equivalents  pledegeable securities  unused borrowing capacity at the fhlb  and loans and non agency securities maturing within one year  divided by deposits and borrowing maturing within one year 
the maturity of deposits excluding certificate of deposits is based on retention rates derived from the most recent external core deposit analysis obtained by the company 
this ratio allows the company to monitor liquidity over a longer time horizon 
at december   the company exceeds the acceptable limit established by alco for this ratio 
as a holding company  bankunited  inc is a corporation separate and apart from our subsidiary bankunited  and therefore  provides for its own liquidity 
bankunited  inc s main sources of funding include management fees and dividends paid by its subsidiaries  and access to capital markets 
there are regulatory limitations that affect the ability of bankunited to pay dividends to bankunited  inc management believes that such limitations will not impact our ability to meet our on going short term cash obligations 
we expect that our cash and liquidity requirements will continue to be generated by operations  including reimbursements under the loss sharing agreements  and we intend to satisfy our capital requirements over the next months through these sources of liquidity 
interest rate sensitivity the principal component of the company s risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments  or market risk  is interest rate risk  including the risk that assets and liabilities with similar repricing characteristics may not reprice at the same time or to the same degree 
the primary objective of the company s asset liability management activities is to maximize net interest income  while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate risk 
the alco is responsible for establishing policies to limit exposure to interest rate risk  and to ensure procedures are established to monitor compliance with these policies 
the guidelines established by alco are reviewed and approved by the company s board of directors 
management believes that the simulation of net interest income in different interest rate environments provides the most meaningful measure of the company s interest rate risk 
income simulation analysis is designed to capture not only the potential of all assets and liabilities to mature or reprice  but also the probability that they will do so 
income simulation also attends to the relative interest rate sensitivities of these items  and projects their behavior over an extended period of time 
finally  income simulation permits management to assess the probable effects on the balance sheet not only of changes in interest rates  but also of proposed strategies for responding to them 
the company s income simulation model analyzes interest rate sensitivity by projecting net interest income over the next twenty four months in a most likely rate scenario based on forward interest rate curves versus net interest income in alternative rate scenarios 
management continually reviews and refines its interest rate risk management process in response to the changing economic climate 

table of contents currently  the company s model projects a plus  plus  and plus basis point change with rates increasing basis points per month until the applicable limit is reached as well as a modified flat scenario incorporating a more flattened yield curve 
we did not simulate a decrease in interest rates at december  due to the extremely low rate environment 
the company s alco policy has established that interest income sensitivity will be considered acceptable if forecasted net interest income in the plus basis point scenario is within of forecasted net interest income in the most likely rate scenario over the next twelve months and within in the second year 
the following table illustrates the impact on forecasted net interest income of a plus basis points scenario at december  and plus december  twelve months twenty four months december  twelve months twenty four months these forecasts are within an acceptable level of interest rate risk per the policies established by alco 
in the event the model indicates an unacceptable level of risk  the company could undertake a number of actions that would reduce this risk  including the sale of a portion of its available for sale investment portfolio or the use of risk management strategies such as interest rate swaps and caps 
many assumptions were used by the company to calculate the impact of changes in interest rates  including the change in rates 
actual results may not be similar to the company s projections due to several factors including the timing and frequency of rate changes  market conditions and the shape of the yield curve 
actual results may also differ due to the company s actions  if any  in response to the changing rates 
off balance sheet arrangements commitments we routinely enter into commitments to extend credit to our customers  including commitments to fund loans or lines of credit and commercial and standby letters of credit 
the credit risk associated with these commitments is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers and they are subject to our normal credit policies and approval processes 
while these commitments represent contractual cash requirements  a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon 
the following table details our outstanding commitments to extend credit as of december  in thousands covered non covered total commitments to fund loans commitments to purchase loans unfunded commitments under lines of credit commercial and standby letters of credit 
table of contents derivative financial instruments interest rate swaps are one of the tools we use to manage interest rate risk 
these derivative instruments are used to mitigate exposure to changes in interest rates on fhlb advances and time deposits 
these interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedging instruments 
the fair value of these instruments is included in other assets or other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets and changes in fair value are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income 
at december   outstanding interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges had an aggregate notional amount of million 
the aggregate fair value of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges included in other liabilities at december  was million 
interest rate swaps not designated as cash flow hedges had an aggregate notional amount of million at december  the aggregate fair value of these interest rate swaps included in other assets was million and the aggregate fair value included in other liabilities was million
