overview we own a large inventory of land suitable for development in florida 
the majority of our land is located in northwest florida and has a very low initial cost basis before considering development costs 
in order to increase the value of these core real estate assets  we seek to reposition portions of our substantial timberland holdings for higher and better uses 
we seek to create value in and or increase demand for our land by securing entitlements for higher and better land uses  facilitating infrastructure improvements  developing community amenities  undertaking strategic and expert land planning and development  parceling our land holdings in creative ways  performing land restoration and enhancement and promoting economic development 
we have four operating segments residential real estate  commercial real estate  rural land sales and forestry 
the table below sets forth the relative contribution of these operating segments to our consolidated operating revenues years ended december  segment operating revenue residential real estate commercial real estate rural land sales forestry consolidated operating revenues 
table of contents our business  financial condition and results of operations continued to be adversely affected during by the real estate downturn  slow economic recovery and other adverse market conditions which have been deeper and more prolonged than originally anticipated 
this challenging environment has exerted negative pressure on the demand for all of our real estate products 
even though we have seen slightly improved residential sales activity we do not expect any significant improvement in market conditions in the near term 
the large oil spill in the gulf of mexico from the deepwater horizon incident has had a negative impact on our properties and results of operations and has created uncertainty about the future of the gulf coast region 
we have filed lawsuits seeking the recovery of damages against parties we believe are responsible for the oil spill 
in addition  we have initiated the process for pursuing portions of our claims through the gulf coast claims facility  the vehicle established by bp exploration and production  inc for claims under the oil pollution act of we cannot be certain  however  of the amount of any recovery or the ultimate success of our claims 
residential real estate our residential real estate segment typically plans and develops mixed use resort  primary and seasonal residential communities of various sizes  primarily on our existing land 
we own large tracts of land in northwest florida  including significant gulf of mexico beach frontage and waterfront properties  and land in and around jacksonville and tallahassee 
our residential real estate segment generates revenues from the sale of developed homesites to retail customers and builders  the sale of parcels of entitled  undeveloped land  the sale of housing units built by us  resort and club operations  rental income  and brokerage fees on certain transactions 
our residential real estate segment incurs cost of revenues from costs directly associated with the land  development and construction of real estate sold  indirect costs such as development overhead  project administration  warranty  capitalized interest and selling costs  resort and club personnel costs  cost of goods sold  and management fees paid to third party managers  operating expenses of rental properties  and brokerage fees 
commercial real estate our commercial real estate segment plans  develops and entitles our land holdings for a broad range of retail  office  hotel  industrial and multi family uses 
we sell and develop commercial land and provide development opportunities for national and regional retailers as well as strategic partners in northwest florida 
we also offer land for commercial and light industrial uses within large and small scale commerce parks  as well as for a wide range of multi family rental projects 
our commercial real estate segment generates revenues from the sale or lease of developed and undeveloped land for retail  multi family  office  hotel and industrial uses and rental income 
our commercial real estate segment incurs costs of revenues from costs directly associated with the land  development costs and selling costs and operating costs of rental properties 

table of contents rural land sales our rural land sales segment markets and sells tracts of land of varying sizes for rural recreational  conservation and timberland uses 
the land sales segment prepares land for sale for these uses through harvesting  thinning and other silviculture practices  and in some cases  limited infrastructure development 
our rural land sales segment generates revenues from the sale of undeveloped land  land with limited development  easements and mitigation bank credits 
our rural land segment incurs costs of revenue from the cost of land or mitigation bank credits sold  minimal development costs and selling costs 
in recent years  our revenue from rural land sales have significantly decreased as a result of our decision to sell only non strategic rural land and to principally use our rural land resources to create sources of recurring revenue as well as from declines in demand for rural land due to difficult current market conditions 
in  we continued to minimize the sale of rural land at today s depressed prices and we expect to continue this strategy in we may  however  rely on rural land sales as a source of revenues and cash in the future 
forestry our forestry segment focuses on the management and harvesting of our extensive timber holdings 
we grow  harvest and sell sawtimber  wood fiber and forest products and provide land management services for conservation properties 
our forestry segment generates revenues from the sale of wood fiber  sawtimber  standing timber and forest products and conservation land management services 
our forestry segment incurs costs of revenues from internal costs of forestry management  external logging costs  and property taxes 
in an inventory of all our pine plantations was completed and a new software platform was implemented to facilitate management of the rural land holdings on a sustainable basis with regard to asset and harvest levels 
these initiatives for the forestry segment have enabled the marketing of products to more diverse customers and the focus on market development 
this plan made available approximately  acres for multiple uses including timber management on land previously held back from silviculture activities 
on march   we entered into a million agreement for the sale of a timber deed which gives the purchaser the right to harvest timber on specific tracts of land encompassing  acres over a maximum term of years 
unlike a pay as cut sales contract  risk of loss and title to the trees transfer to the buyer when the contract is signed 
the buyer pays the full purchase price when the contract is signed and we do not have any additional performance obligations 
under a timber deed  the buyer or some other third party is responsible for all logging and hauling costs  if any  and the timing of such activity 
revenue from a timber deed sale is recognized when the contract is signed because the earnings process is complete 
as part of the agreement  we also entered into a thinnings supply agreement  pursuant to which we agreed  to the extent that the buyer decided to conduct a first thinning  to purchase of such first thinnings at fair market value 
during   we purchased approximately million  respectively  of first thinnings 
in november  we entered into a new wood fiber supply agreement with smurfit stone container corporation  which was recently acquired by rocktenn  the wood fiber supply agreement 
the new agreement replaces an agreement that we had entered into in july and that was scheduled to expire in june under the agreement  we agreed to sell million tons of pulpwood to rocktenn s pulp and paper mill in panama city  florida over the next seven years 
the new agreement also included more favorable pricing terms for us  provided for a steady demand for much of our wood fiber harvest and removed certain restrictions on our timberlands contained in the previous agreement 
restructuring and relocation program in  we announced that we were relocating our corporate headquarters from jacksonville  florida to watersound  florida and consolidating existing offices from tallahassee  port st 
joe and walton county into the watersound location 
these relocations were completed in the second quarter of as a result of this restructuring and relocation program we incurred approximately million of one time charges during and million during primarily relating to one time termination benefits in connection with the termination of 
table of contents employees that would not be relocating and relocation benefits for those employees that would be relocating  as well as certain ancillary facility related costs 
the relocation costs include relocation bonuses  temporary lodging expenses  resettlement expenses  tax payments  shipping and storage of household goods  and closing costs for housing transactions 
although we previously announced that we would build a new headquarters facility  we have now decided to indefinitely delay the development of the new corporate headquarters building and impaired million of predevelopment costs related to the new building in restructuring program in the first quarter of  as a result of discussions between our board of directors and fairholme capital management  llc  the largest beneficial owner of our common stock  wm 
britton greene entered into a separation agreement with us and resigned as our president and chief executive officer 
on april   we entered into separation agreements with four additional members of senior management 
as a result of these five separations  we incurred approximately million in charges during pursuant to the separation agreements of these individuals 
these amounts do not include the additional million non cash compensation expense arising from the accelerated vesting of mr 
greene s restricted stock unit grants 
our new management team adopted a restructuring plan aimed at significantly reducing operating costs 
as part of this plan  we incurred approximately million of charges during related to severance payments to employees 
our cost saving initiatives included lowering employee related costs by reducing headcount from as of february  to as of february   saving on occupancy costs by consolidating offices  renegotiating vendor contracts  and reducing discretionary spending where possible 
we expect that our cost savings efforts will generate a decrease of approximately million to million in operating and corporate expenses on an annualized basis 
critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  equity  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base these estimates on our historical and current experience and on various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
we evaluate the results of these estimates on an on going basis 
management s estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements investment in real estate and cost of real estate sales 
costs associated with a specific real estate project are capitalized during the development period 
we capitalize costs directly associated with development and construction of identified real estate projects 
indirect costs that clearly relate to a specific project under development  such as internal costs of a regional project field office  are also capitalized 
we capitalize interest up to total interest expense based on the amount of underlying expenditures and real estate taxes on real estate projects under development 
if we determine not to complete a project  any previously capitalized costs are expensed in the period in which the determination is made 
real estate inventory costs include land and common development costs such as roads  sewers and amenities  multi family construction costs  capitalized property taxes  capitalized interest and certain indirect costs 
construction costs for single family homes are determined based upon actual costs incurred 
a portion of real estate inventory costs and estimates for costs to complete are allocated to each unit based on the relative sales value of each unit as compared to the estimated sales value of the total project 
these estimates are reevaluated at least annually and more frequently if warranted by market conditions or other factors  with any adjustments being allocated prospectively to the remaining units available for sale 

table of contents our new real estate investment strategy is focused on reducing future capital outlays and employing a risk adjusted investment return criteria for evaluating our properties and future investments in such properties 
pursuant to this new strategy  we intend to significantly reduce planned future capital expenditures for infrastructure  amenities and master planned community development and reposition certain assets to encourage increased absorption of such properties in their respective markets 
as part of this repositioning  we expect properties may be sold in bulk  in undeveloped or developed parcels  or at lower price points and over shorter time periods 
the accounting estimate related to real estate impairment evaluation is susceptible to change due to the use of assumptions about future sales proceeds and future expenditures 
for projects under development  an estimate of future cash flows on an undiscounted basis is performed using estimated future expenditures necessary to maintain the existing project and using management s best estimates about future sales prices and planned holding periods 
based on the company s recently adopted risk adjusted investment return criteria for evaluating the company s projects under development or undeveloped  management s assumptions used in the projection of undiscounted cash flows included the projected pace of sales of homesites based on estimated market conditions and the company s development plans  estimated pricing and projected price appreciation over time  which can range from to annually  the amount and trajectory of price appreciation over the estimate selling period  the length of the estimated development and selling periods  which can range from to years depending on the size of the development and the number of phases to be developed  the amount of remaining development costs  including the extent of infrastructure or amenities included in such development costs  holding costs to be incurred over the selling period  for bulk land sales of undeveloped and developed parcels future pricing is based upon estimated developed lot pricing less estimated development costs and estimated developer profit at  for commercial development property  future pricing is based on sales of comparable property in similar markets  and assumptions regarding the intent and ability to hold individual investments in real estate over projected periods and related assumptions regarding available liquidity to fund continued development 
for operating properties  an estimate of undiscounted cash flows requires management to make similar assumptions about the use and eventual disposition of such properties 
some of the significant assumptions that are used to develop the undiscounted cash flows include for investments in inns and rental condominium units  average occupancy and room rates  revenues from food and beverage and other amenity operations  operating expenses and capital expenditures  and eventual disposition of such properties as private residence vacation units or condominiums  based on current prices for similar units appreciated to the expected sale date  for investments in commercial or retail property  future occupancy and rental rates and the amount of proceeds to be realized upon eventual disposition of such property at a terminal capitalization rate  and  for investments in golf courses  future rounds and greens fees  operating expenses and capital expenditures  and the amount of proceeds to be realized upon eventual disposition of such properties at a multiple of terminal year cash flows 

table of contents other properties that management does not intend to sell in the near term under current market conditions and has the ability to hold are evaluated for impairment based on management s best estimate of the long term use and eventual disposition of the property 
the results of impairment analyses for development and operating properties are particularly dependent on the estimated holding and selling period for each asset group 
based on our recently adopted risk adjusted investment return criteria  these future holding periods have been reduced to a maximum period of years 
fair value measurements 
we follow the fair value provisions of asc fair value measurements and disclosures asc for our financial and non financial assets and liabilities 
asc  among other things  defines fair value  establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure for each major asset and liability category measured at fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis 
asc clarifies that fair value is an exit price  representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
as such  fair value is a market based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability 
as a basis for considering such assumptions  asc establishes a three tier fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets  level inputs  other than the quoted prices in active markets  that are observable either directly or indirectly  and level unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data  such as internally developed valuation models which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions 
our assets and liabilities utilizing level and inputs in fair value calculations and the associated underlying assumptions include the following investment in real estate 
our investments in real estate are carried at cost unless circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
if we determine that an impairment exists due to the inability to recover an asset s carrying value  a provision for loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value 
if such assets were held for sale  the provision for loss would be recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value less costs to sell 
for the assets described above  we use varying methods to determine fair value  such as i analyzing expected future cash flows  ii determining resale values by market  or iii applying a capitalization rate to net operating income using prevailing rates in a given market 
fair value of a property may be derived either from discounting projected cash flows at an appropriate discount rate to  through appraisals of the underlying property  or a combination thereof 
retained interest 
we have recorded a retained interest with respect to the monetization of certain installment notes through the use of qualified special purpose entities  which is recorded in other assets 
the retained interest is an estimate based on the present value of cash flows to be received over the life of the installment notes 
we recognize interest income over the life of the retained interest using the effective yield method with discount rates ranging from 
this income adjustment is being recorded as an offset to loss on monetization of notes over the life of the installment notes 
in addition  fair value may be adjusted at each reporting date when  based on management s assessment of current information and events  there is a favorable or adverse change in estimated cash flows from cash flows previously projected 
pension asset 
our cash balance defined benefit pension plan holds a royalty investment for which there is no quoted market price 
fair value of the royalty investment is estimated based on the present value of future cash flows  using management s best estimate of key assumptions  including discount rates 
standby guarantee liability 
on october   we entered into a strategic alliance agreement with southwest airlines to facilitate the commencement of low fare air service in may to the new northwest florida beaches international airport in northwest florida 
we have agreed to reimburse southwest airlines if it incurs losses on its service at the new airport during the first three years of service 
the agreement also provides that southwest s 
table of contents profits from the air service during the term of the agreement will be shared with us up to the maximum amount of our break even payments 
we measured the standby guarantee liability at fair value based upon a discounted cash flow analysis based on our best estimates of future cash flows to be paid by us pursuant to the strategic alliance agreement 
these cash flows were estimated using numerous estimates including future fuel costs  passenger load factors  air fares  seasonality and the timing of the commencement of service 
the fair value of the liability could fluctuate up or down significantly as a result of changes in assumptions related to these estimates and could have a material impact on our operating results 
pension plan 
we sponsor a cash balance defined benefit pension plan covering a majority of our employees 
the accounting for pension benefits is determined by accounting and actuarial methods using numerous estimates  including discount rates  expected long term investment returns on plan assets  employee turnover  mortality and retirement ages  and future salary increases 
changes in these key assumptions can have a significant effect on the pension plan s impact on the financial statements of the company 
for example  in  a increase in the assumed long term rate of return on pension assets would have resulted in a million increase in pre tax income million net of tax 
however  a decrease in the assumed long term rate of return would have caused an equivalent decrease in pre tax income 
a increase or decrease in the assumed discount rate would have resulted in a less than million change in pre tax income 
our pension plan was overfunded and we do not expect to make contributions to the pension plan in the future 
the ratio of plan assets to projected benefit obligation was at december  stock based compensation 
we have offered stock incentive plans whereby awards were granted to certain employees and non employee directors in the form of restricted shares of our common stock or options to purchase our common stock 
stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is typically recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 
in february  and  we granted select executives and other key employees restricted stock awards with vesting based upon the achievement of certain market conditions that are defined as our total shareholder return as compared to the total shareholder return of certain peer groups during a three year performance period 
we have used a monte carlo simulation pricing model to determine the fair value of our market condition awards 
the determination of the fair value of market condition based awards is affected by the stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of other variables 
these variables include expected stock price volatility over the requisite performance term of the awards  the relative performance of our stock price and shareholder returns compared to those companies in our peer groups and a risk free interest rate assumption 
compensation cost is recognized regardless of the achievement of the market condition  provided the requisite service period is met 
income taxes 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  significant management judgment is required to estimate our income taxes 
our estimates are based on our interpretation of federal and state tax laws 
we estimate our actual current tax due and assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
the temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets based upon our analysis of the timing and reversal of future taxable amounts and our history and future expectations of taxable income 
adjustments may be required by a change in assessment of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  changes due to audit adjustments by federal and state tax authorities  and changes in tax laws 
to the extent adjustments are required in any given period we will include the adjustments in the tax provision in our financial statements 
these adjustments could materially impact our financial position  cash flow and results of operation 
at december   the company had a federal net operating loss of approximately million and a state net operating loss carry forward of million 
these net operating losses are available to offset future taxable income through in general  a valuation allowance is recorded if based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized realization of the company s deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company generating sufficient taxable income in future years in the appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain a benefit from the reversal of deductible temporary differences and from loss carryforwards 
based on the timing of reversal of future taxable amounts and the company s recent history of losses and future expectations of 
table of contents reporting taxable losses  management does not believe it met the requirements to realize the benefits of certain of its deferred tax assets and has provided for a valuation allowance of million at december  the company also recorded in a valuation allowance of million to offset the deferred tax asset component recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income 
at december   the company had a valuation allowance of million related to state net operating losses and charitable contribution carry forwards

asu requires some new disclosures and clarifies some existing disclosure requirements about fair value measurement as set forth in codification subtopic asu amends codification subtopic to now require a reporting entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers  in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs  a reporting entity should present separately information about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements  and a reporting entity should provide disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements 
asu is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements

corporate expense increased million  or  in over the increase in corporate expense is primarily due to legal fees and cleanup costs totaling million associated with the deepwater horizon incident 
these costs were partially offset by a reduction in employee and administrative costs as a result of reduced headcount and cost savings initiatives 
pension settlement charge 
on june   as plan sponsor  we signed a commitment for the pension plan to purchase a group annuity contract from massachusetts mutual life insurance company for the benefit of the retired participants and certain other former employee participants in our pension plan 
current and former employees with cash balances in the pension plan were not affected by the transaction 
the purchase price of the annuity was approximately million  which was funded from the assets of the pension plan on june  and included a premium to assume these obligations 
the transaction resulted in the transfer and settlement of pension benefit obligations of approximately million which represented the obligation prior to the annuity purchase of the affected retirees and vested terminated employees 
in addition  we recorded a non cash pre tax settlement charge to earnings during of million and an offsetting million pre tax credit in accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheet 
as a result of this transaction  we were able to significantly increase the funded status ratio thereby reducing the potential for future funding requirements 
we also recorded additional pension charges of million  million and million during  and  respectively  as a result of reduced employment levels in connection with our restructuring programs 
impairment losses 
during  we have recorded significant impairment charges primarily due to our change in real estate investment strategy 
in and  we recorded significant impairment charges  as a result of the decline in demand and market prices in our real estate markets

johns golf and country club total impairment charges discontinued operations total impairment charges 
table of contents in connection with implementing our new real estate investment strategy  we reassessed the carrying value of our real estate and determined that an impairment to record certain of our assets to fair value was necessary 
accordingly  we recorded a non cash charge for impairment in of million 
earlier in  we also recorded an million impairment on development costs incurred on the indefinitely delayed construction of the corporate headquarters building located at venturecrossings and approximately million in impairment charges on homes and homesites 
for further discussion  see note  impairments of long lived assets  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
given the downturn in our real estate markets  we implemented a tax strategy in to benefit from the sale of certain non strategic assets at a loss 
under federal tax rules  losses from asset sales realized in were carried back and applied to taxable income from  resulting in a federal income tax refund for as part of this strategy  during  we conducted a nationally marketed sale process for the disposition of the remaining assets of our non strategic victoria park community in deland  florida  including homes  homesites  undeveloped land  notes receivable and a golf course 
based on the likelihood of the closing of the sale  we determined on december  that an impairment charge for million was necessary 
we completed the sale on december  for million 
in addition  we completed the sale of our sevenshores condominium and marina development project for million earlier in  which resulted in an impairment charge of million 
we also wrote off million of capitalized costs related to abandoned development plans in certain of our communities in we also sold our st 
johns golf and country club for million in december which resulted in an impairment charge of million 
a continued decline in demand and market prices for our real estate products or further changes to management s plans also may require us to record additional impairment charges in the future 
notes receivable we evaluate the carrying value of notes receivable at each reporting date 
notes receivable balances are adjusted to net realizable value based upon a review of entity specific facts or when terms are modified 
during  we settled our notes receivable with saussy burbank for less than book value and recorded a charge of million 
as part of the settlement  we agreed to take back previously collateralized inventory consisting of lots and homes which were valued at current estimated sales prices  less costs to sell 
subsequently  all the lots and homes were sold which resulted in an additional impairment charge of million 
we also recorded a charge of million related to the write off of the outstanding advantis note receivable balance during as the amount was determined to be uncollectible 
in addition  we received a deed in lieu of foreclosure related to a million builder note receivable during and renegotiated terms related to certain other builder notes receivable during and these events resulted in additional impairment charges of less than million  million and million in  and  respectively 
because of the ongoing challenges in our real estate markets and tightened credit conditions  we may be required to record additional write downs of the carrying value of our notes receivable and ultimately such notes may not be collectible

table of contents similar to the markets for residential real estate  the markets for commercial real estate have experienced a significant downturn 
in addition to the negative effects of the prolonged downturn in demand for residential real estate  commercial real estate markets have also been negatively affected by the prolonged weakness of the general economy and continuing uncertainty about the gulf coast region as a result of the deepwater horizon incident 
much of our current commercial real estate activity is focused on the opportunities presented by the northwest florida beaches international airport  which opened in may and is surrounded by our properties in the west bay sector

rural land sales our rural land sales segment markets and sells tracts of land of varying sizes for rural recreational  conservation and timberland uses 
the land sales segment prepares land for sale for these uses through harvesting  thinning and other silviculture practices  and in some cases  limited development 
while we have reduced our offerings of rural land  like residential and commercial land  demand for rural land has also declined as a result of the current difficult market conditions

in  we continued to minimize the sale of rural land at today s depressed prices and expect to continue this strategy in we may however  rely on rural land sales as a significant source of revenue and cash in the future 
in  we began selling wetland mitigation credits to third parties from our two federal and state wetland mitigation banks 
we own and operate these two wetland mitigation banks and by conducting certain prescribed land management and timbering activities that enhance and restore the wetlands in these banks  we are allowed to sell credits that enable third parties to obtain environmental permits from the federal and state regulatory authorities 
during  we closed four land transactions totaling acres at an average price of  per acre and sold mitigation credits for  per credit generating million in revenue 
average sales prices per acre vary according to the characteristics of each particular piece of land being sold and its highest and best use 
as a result  average prices will vary from one period to another
