item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a reit in the business of acquiring  investing in  financing and managing primarily mortgage related and  to a lesser extent  financial assets 
our objective is to manage a portfolio of investments that will deliver stable distributions to our stockholders over diverse economic conditions 
we intend to achieve this objective through a combination of net interest margin and net realized capital gains from our investment portfolio 
our portfolio includes investments sourced from distressed markets over the previous two years that create the potential for capital gains as well as more traditional types of mortgage related investments  such as agency arms and agency ios  that generate interest income 
since  we have endeavored to build a diversified investment portfolio that includes elements of interest rate and credit risk  as we believe a portfolio diversified among interest rate and credit risks are best suited to delivering stable cash flows over various economic cycles 
in  we refined our investment strategy from one focused on a broad range of alternative assets sourced by hcs to an investment strategy focused on residential and multi family loans and securities 
in connection with this focus  we entered into separate investment management agreements with midway and riverbanc to provide investment management services with respect to certain of our investment strategies  including our investments in agency rmbs comprised of ios  which we sometimes refer to as agency ios  and cmbs backed by commercial mortgage loans on multi family properties  which we refer to as multi family cmbs 
our investment focus having moved away from the alternative assets sourced by hcs  our board of directors determined to terminate the advisory agreement with hcs on december   resulting in a one time charge of approximately million 
we believe we are well positioned heading into with seasoned investment managers  a focused residential strategy and an investment pipeline that we expect will produce long term stable returns 
our targeted assets currently include agency rmbs consisting of adjustable rate and hybrid adjustable rate rmbs  which we sometimes refer to as agency arms  and agency ios  and multi family cmbs 
we have elected to be taxed as a reit and have complied  and intend to continue to comply  with the provisions of the internal revenue code  with respect thereto 
accordingly  we do not expect to be subject to federal income tax on our reit taxable income that we currently distribute to our stockholders if certain asset  income and ownership tests and recordkeeping requirements are fulfilled 
even if we maintain our qualification as a reit  we expect to be subject to some federal  state and local taxes on our income generated in our trss 
factors that affect our results of operations and financial condition our results of operations and financial condition are affected by various factors  including  among other things changes in interest rates  rates of prepayment  default and recovery on our assets or the mortgages or loans underlying such assets  general economic and financial and credit market conditions  our leverage  our access to funding and our borrowing costs  our hedging activities  changes in the credit quality or ratings of the loans  securities  and other assets we own  changes in the market value of our investments  allocation of capital between various asset classes  liabilities related to our discontinued operation  the performance of our external managers  legislative or regulatory changes  as well as actions taken by the us federal reserve and the us government  and requirements to maintain reit status and to qualify for an exemption from registration under the investment company act 
we earn income and generate cash through our investments 
our income is generated primarily from the net spread  which we refer to as net interest income  which is the difference between the interest and other income we earn on assets in our investment portfolio and the cost of our borrowings and hedging activities 
our net interest income will vary based upon  among other things  the difference between the interest rates earned on our interest earning assets and the borrowing costs of the liabilities used to finance those investments  prepayment speeds and default and recovery rates on the assets or the loans underlying such assets 
because changes in interest rates may significantly affect our activities  our operating results depend  in large part  upon our ability to manage interest rate and prepayment risks effectively while maintaining our status as a reit 
we anticipate that  for any period during which changes in the interest rates earned on our assets do not coincide with interest rate changes on our borrowings  such assets will reprice more slowly than the corresponding liabilities 
consequently  changes in interest rates  particularly short term interest rates  may significantly influence our net interest income 
with the maturities of our assets generally of longer duration than those of our liabilities  interest rate increases will tend to decrease the net interest income we derive from  and the market value of our interest rate sensitive assets and therefore our book value 
such rate increases could possibly result in operating losses or adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
the yield on our assets may be affected by a difference between the actual prepayment rates and our projections 
prepayment rates  as reflected by the rate of principal paydown  vary according to the current interest rate environment  the type of investment  conditions in the economy and financial markets  government action  competition and other factors  none of which can be predicted with any certainty 
to the extent we have acquired assets at a premium or discount to par  or face value  changes in prepayment rates may impact our anticipated yield 
in periods of declining interest rates  prepayments on our mortgage related assets will likely increase 
if we are unable to reinvest the proceeds of such prepayments at comparable yields  our net interest income will be negatively impacted 
the current climate of government intervention in the mortgage markets significantly increases the risk associated with prepayments 
while we historically have used  and intend to use in the future  hedging to mitigate some of our interest rate risk  we do not hedge all of our exposure to changes in interest rates  as there are practical limitations on our ability to insulate our portfolio from all potential negative consequences associated with changes in short term interest rates in a manner that will allow us to seek or maintain attractive net spreads on our assets 
in addition  our returns will be affected by the credit performance and market risks of our more credit sensitive assets  such as our non agency rmbs  cmbs  equity investment in a pool of mortgage loans and clos 
these investments and certain of our targeted assets  as well as other assets that we may acquire from time to time  expose us to credit risk and various market risks 
to mitigate the credit risks associated with these assets  we may acquire more senior pieces of the capital structure  purchase the assets at discounted prices or hedge with credit sensitive derivative instruments 
nevertheless  if credit losses on our investments  loans  or the loans underlying our investments exceed our expectations or our ability to adequately hedge against these losses  it may have an adverse effect on our performance and our earnings 
in addition to the impact of credit risk  our returns may be impacted by changes in the market values of these assets 
market values of these investments may decline for a number of reasons  such as actual or perceived increases in defaults or prepayment experience  or the widening of credit spreads 
if the market values of our investments were to decline for any reason  our book value would likely be negatively impacted

current market conditions and commentary general 
despite some positive momentum and optimism in early with respect to an acceleration of the us economic recovery  the economy and markets generally exhibited continued lackluster economic growth in the us in due to a lack of job growth and significant volatility in the financial markets  which was primarily due to concerns regarding euro zone sovereign debt and the us federal deficit and debt ceiling debates 
it remains unclear what impact these events may have on the global economy in additionally  despite recent labor reports from the us department of labor that suggest that labor market conditions are improving and recent data suggesting the us economic outlook is improving  inflation and wage pressure expectations remain low and the us housing market continues to face significant headwinds 
in august and again in november  the federal reserve announced that it intends to keep the federal funds target rate near zero through mid  thereby suggesting  in our view  that the federal reserve expects sluggish growth again in this environment has fostered continued strong demand for agency rmbs backed by arms and fixed rate mortgages while also helping to keep the costs of financing and hedging at or near historical lows 
on august   standard poor s lowered its long term sovereign credit rating of the us from aaa to aa 
the downgrade reflected standard poor s view that the fiscal consolidation plan of the us congress at that time fell short of what would be necessary to stabilize the us government s medium term debt dynamics 
in addition  many economists and financial analysts continue to believe that other rating agencies may lower their long term sovereign credit ratings of the us in the near future 
because the guarantees provided by fannie mae and freddie mac are perceived by investors to be guaranteed by the us government  if the us s credit rating were further downgraded or downgraded by other ratings agencies  it would likely impact the credit risk associated with agency rmbs and  therefore  decrease the value of the agency rmbs in our portfolio 
moreover  any further downgrade of the us s credit rating may create broader financial turmoil and uncertainty  which could have significant consequences for the global banking system and credit markets generally 
recent government actions 
many political and economic analysts believe that there is little likelihood of any significant legislation being passed by the us congress prior to the presidential election  including meaningful deficit reduction legislation 
in recent years  the us government and the federal reserve and other governmental regulatory bodies have  however  taken numerous actions to stabilize or improve market and economic conditions in the us or to assist homeowners and may in the future take additional significant actions that may impact our portfolio and our business 
a description of recent government actions that we believe are most relevant to our operations and business is included below on september   the us federal reserve announced the maturity extension program where it intends to sell billion of shorter term us treasury securities by the end of june and use the proceeds to buy longer term us treasury securities 
this program is intended to extend the average maturity of the securities in the federal reserve s portfolio 
by reducing the supply of longer term us treasury securities in the market  this action should put downward pressure on longer term interest rates  including rates on financial assets that investors consider to be close substitutes for longer term us treasury securities  like certain types of agency rmbs 
the reduction in longer term interest rates  in turn  may contribute to a broad easing in financial market conditions that the federal reserve hopes will provide additional stimulus to support the economic recovery 
on october   the fhfa  along with fannie mae and freddie mac  announced several changes to be made to harp 
among those changes to harp that are now part of harp ii are the reduction or elimination in certain cases  of many risk based fees charged to borrowers when refinancing  the expansion of the previous loan to value ceiling to allow all underwater borrowers those borrowers who owe more on their mortgages than the value of their homes to participate in the program  regardless of the size of their loan versus the value of their home and the removal of certain representations and warranties made on behalf of lenders for loans owned or guaranteed by fannie mae or freddie mac  among other changes 
these refinancing opportunities will only be available to borrowers with loans originated prior to june  that are owned or guaranteed by fannie mae or freddie mac and  aside from the expansion of harp as described above  are subject to the restrictions originally put in place for the program 
although it is not yet possible to gauge the ultimate success of harp ii and the expansion announcement  the fhfa s actions present the opportunity for many borrowers  who previously could not  to take advantage of the ability to refinance their mortgages into lower interest rates  possibly resulting in higher prepayment speeds in the future 
this could negatively impact our agency rmbs  particularly the performance of our agency ios  however  it is unknown at this time what the ultimate impact will be on our portfolio 
moreover  in his annual state of the union address on january   president obama announced his desire for the us congress to pass legislation that would extend this policy to non agency borrowers with standard non jumbo loans who are current with their mortgage payments 
however  as discussed above  many political analysts believe that such legislation is unlikely to be passed by the us congress prior to the presidential election 
on august   the sec published a concept release no 
ic  file no 
sw  companies engaged in the business of acquiring mortgages and mortgage related instruments pursuant to which it is reviewing whether certain companies that invest in mortgage backed securities and rely on the exemption from registration under section c c of the investment company act should continue to be allowed to rely on such exemption from registration 
this release suggests that the sec may modify the exemption relied upon by companies similar to us that invest in mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities 
developments at fannie mae and freddie mac 
payments on the agency rmbs in which we invest are guaranteed by fannie mae and freddie mac 
as broadly publicized  fannie mae and freddie mac have experienced significant losses in recent years  and are presently under federal conservatorship as the us government continues to evaluate the futures of these entities and what role the us government should continue to play in the housing markets in the future 
the scope and nature of the actions that the us government will ultimately undertake with respect to the future of fannie mae and freddie mac are unknown and will continue to evolve 
new regulations and programs related to fannie mae and freddie mac may adversely affect the pricing  supply  liquidity and value of rmbs and otherwise materially harm our business and operations 
credit spreads 
over the past few years  the credit markets generally experienced tightening credit spreads specifically  spreads between us treasury securities and other securities mainly due to the strong demand for lending opportunities 
however  during the past three months  the credit markets experienced significant spread widening due to a series of factors  including concerns related to a possible global economic slowdown  the european sovereign debt crisis and continued concern with respect to certain us domestic economic policies 
additionally  harp ii has created a perception that prepayment speeds will rise in the near future  thereby placing additional pressure on credit spreads 
finally  during the third quarter of the year u 
s treasury note reached a yield of  a historic low and increased only marginally during the fourth quarter of all of these factors have contributed to significant widening of credit spreads  which typically has a negative impact on credit sensitive assets such as clos and multi family cmbs  as well as agency ios 
financing markets and liquidity 
the availability of repurchase agreement financing is stable with interest rates between and for day repurchase agreements 
the day london interbank offered rate libor was at december   marking an increase of approximately basis points from september   and an increase of basis points from the previous year end 
while we expect interest rates to rise over the longer term  we believe that interest rates  and thus our short term financing costs  are likely to remain at these historically low levels until such time as the economic data begin to confirm an acceleration of overall economic recovery 
prepayment rates 
as a result of various government initiatives and the reduction in intermediate and longer term treasury yields  rates on conforming mortgages have reached and remained at historical lows during the second half of and into early while these trends have historically resulted in higher rates of refinancing and thus higher prepayment speeds  we continue to experience relatively low prepayment rates for the current interest rate environment 
note regarding discontinued operation in connection with the sale of our wholesale and retail mortgage lending platform assets in  we classified our mortgage lending business as a discontinued operation 
as a result  we have reported revenues and expenses related to the mortgage lending business as a discontinued operation and the related assets and liabilities as assets and liabilities related to a discontinued operation for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
certain assets and liabilities  such as our deferred tax asset and our subordinated debt  are part of our ongoing operations and accordingly  have not been classified as a discontinued operation

the discontinued operations had net income of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we continue to wind down the discontinued operations and anticipate to be substantially complete with such winding down by the end of financial condition as of december   we had approximately million of total assets  as compared to approximately million of total assets as of december  the increase in total assets is primarily a function of more fully investing our available capital on a levered basis and our increased capital base  which resulted from raising additional capital during the year

as of december   there were approximately million of repurchase borrowings outstanding 
our repurchase agreements typically have terms of days or less 
as of december   the current weighted average borrowing rate on these financing facilities was 
for the year ended december   the ending balance  yearly average and maximum balance at any month end for our repurchase agreement borrowings were million  million and million  respectively 
collateralized debt obligations 
as of december   we had million of collateralized debt obligations  or cdos  outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 
subordinated debentures 
as of december   one of our wholly owned subsidiaries had trust preferred securities outstanding of million with a weighted average interest rate of 
the securities are fully guaranteed by us with respect to distributions and amounts payable upon liquidation  redemption or repayment 
these securities are classified as subordinated debentures in the liability section of our consolidated balance sheet included in this annual report 
our subordinated debentures in the amount of million have a floating interest rate equal to three month libor plus  resetting quarterly  the interest rate on these subordinated debentures was at december  these securities mature on march  and may be called at par by us any time after march  the subsidiary that issued these securities entered into an interest rate cap agreement to limit the maximum interest rate cost of these trust preferred securities to through march   at which point the interest rate cap expired 
our subordinated debentures in the amount of million had a fixed interest rate equal to up to and including july   at which point the interest rate converted to a floating rate equal to one month libor plus until maturity  the interest rate on these subordinated debentures was at december  the securities mature on october  and may be called at par by us any time after october  convertible preferred debentures 
the company issued million in series a convertible preferred stock that matured on december  the outstanding shares were redeemed by the company at the per share liquidation preference plus accrued dividends on december  derivative assets and liabilities 
we generally hedge the risks related to changes in interest rates related to our borrowings as well as market values of our overall portfolio 
in order to reduce our interest rate risk related to our borrowings  we may utilize various hedging instruments  such as interest rate swap agreement contracts whereby we receive floating rate payments in exchange for fixed rate payments  effectively converting our short term repurchase agreement borrowings or cdos to a fixed rate 
at december   the company had million of notional amount of interest rate swaps outstanding with a fair market liability value of million 
the interest rate swaps qualify as cash flow hedges for financial reporting purposes 
in addition to utilizing interest rate swaps  we may purchase or sell short us treasury securities or enter into eurodollar or other futures contracts or options to help mitigate the potential impact of changes in interest rates on the performance of our agency ios 
we may borrow securities to cover short sales of us treasury securities under reverse repurchase agreements 
we account for the securities borrowing transactions as reverse repurchase agreements on our consolidated balance sheet 
short sales of us treasury securities are accounted for as securities sold short  at fair value 
realized and unrealized gains and losses associated with purchases and short sales of us treasury securities and eurodollar or other futures are recognized through earnings in the consolidated statements of operations 
the company uses tbas  us treasury securities and us treasury futures and options to hedge interest rate risk  as well as spread risk associated with its investments in agency ios 
for example  we may utilize tbas to hedge the interest rate or yield spread risk inherent in our long agency rmbs by taking short positions in tbas that are similar in character 
in a tba transaction  we would agree to purchase or sell  for future delivery  agency rmbs with certain principal and interest terms and certain types of underlying collateral  but the particular agency rmbs to be delivered is not identified until shortly before the tba settlement date 
the company typically does not take delivery of tbas  but rather settles with its trading counterparties on a net basis 
tbas are liquid and have quoted market prices and represent the most actively traded class of rmbs 
for tba contracts that we have entered into  we have not asserted that physical settlement is probable 
because we have not designated these forward commitments associated with our agency ios as hedging instruments  realized and unrealized gains and losses associated with these tbas  us treasury securities and us treasury futures and options are recognized through earnings in the consolidated statements of operations 
the use of tbas exposes the company to market value risk  as the market value of the securities that the company is required to purchase pursuant to a tba transaction may decline below the agreed upon purchase price 
conversely  the market value of the securities that the company is required to sell pursuant to a tba transaction may increase above the agreed upon sale price 
the use of tbas associated with our agency io investments creates significant short term payables and or receivables on our balance sheet 
for more information regarding our use of tbas please see note derivative instruments and hedging activities included in item of this annual report on form k 
derivative financial instruments may contain credit risk to the extent that the institutional counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements 
we minimize this risk by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions with good credit ratings 
in addition  we regularly monitor the potential risk of loss with any one party resulting from this type of credit risk 
accordingly  we do not expect any material losses as a result of default by other parties  but cannot guarantee we do not have counterparty failures 
the following table presents the fair value of derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments and their location in the company s consolidated balance sheets at december  and  respectively dollar amounts in thousands derivatives designated as hedging instruments balance sheet location december  december  interest rate swaps derivative liabilities at december   we had million in notional interest rate swaps outstanding 
should market rates for similar term interest rate swaps drop below the fixed rates we have agreed to on our interest rate swaps  we will be required to post additional margin to the swap counterparty  reducing available liquidity 
at december   the company pledged million in cash margin to cover decreased valuations for our interest rate swaps 
the weighted average maturity of the swaps was years at december  our investment in agency ios involves several types of derivative instruments used to hedge the overall risk profile of our investments in agency ios 
this hedging technique is dynamic in nature and requires frequent adjustments  which accordingly makes it very difficult to qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
hedge accounting treatment requires specific identification of a risk or group of risks and then requires that we designate a particular trade to that risk with no minimal ability to adjust over the life of the transaction 
because we and our external manager are frequently adjusting these derivative instruments in response to current market conditions  we have determined to account for all the derivative instruments related to our agency io investments as derivatives not designated as hedging instruments

executive summary of operating results and stockholders equity for quarter and year ended december  for the quarter ended december   the company reported consolidated net loss attributable to common stockholders of million  or per common share  as compared to consolidated net income attributable to common stockholders of million  or per common share  for the quarter ended december  the decline in net income for the fourth quarter of was primarily due to realized and unrealized losses on investment securities and related hedges associated with the company s agency io strategy of million and million  respectively  during the fourth quarter of  as compared to realized and unrealized gains on investment securities and related hedges associated with agency ios of million and  respectively  during the fourth quarter of in addition  the company took a one time charge of million related to the termination of its advisory agreement with hcs  which negatively impacted net income for the fourth quarter 
although the realized and unrealized losses contributed to the company s decline in net income for the fourth quarter  the company s investment portfolio continued to post strong net interest income results  generating million in net interest income in the fourth quarter  which represents a improvement over net interest income for the same period of the increase in net interest income during the fourth quarter as compared to the same period in  was primarily driven by a basis point increase in net interest income which was mainly due to the performance of the company s agency ios and its investments in the multi family cmbs 
for the year ended december   the company reported consolidated net income attributable to common stockholders of million  or per common share  as compared to million  or per common share  for the year ended december  the decrease in full year earnings as compared to the same period in was driven by a net unrealized loss of million on investment securities and related hedges associated with the company s agency ios  partially offset by realized gains of million on the sale of clo notes during because of the hedging strategy employed by the company with respect to its agency ios  unrealized gains and losses are not designated for hedge accounting treatment  and therefore are directly run through the company s income statement 
similar to the fourth quarter of  full year net income was also impacted by the one time charge of million related to the termination of the advisory agreement with hcs 
for full year  the company s net interest income reached record levels at million  an increase of million  which represents an improvement over net interest income from the previous year 
the increase in net interest income for the year as compared to the same period in was primarily driven by a basis point increase in net interest income spread which was mainly due to the performance of the company s agency ios and multi family cmbs  as well as the repayment of million of convertible preferred debentures on december  which had an interest rate of 
as of december   the company s book value per common share was  down from at september  and at december  the decrease since september  is due in part to the unrealized losses in our credit sensitive securities of approximately per share  the net loss for the fourth quarter of per share and dividends of per share 
the decline in book value since december  is due in part to unrealized losses on clo notes of approximately per share and unrealized losses on multi family cmbs of approximately per share  each due primarily to widening credit spreads  and unrealized losses associated with our agency ios and related hedges of approximately per share 
unrealized gains and losses on the company s clos are run through the balance sheet and as a result  directly impact stockholders equity and book value per share 
as of december   since the inception of our investment in these securities  our clos have generated realized gains of million and unrealized gains of million 
while unrealized losses associated with the company s agency ios and related hedges are run through the income statement  they do impact the company s book value per share through retained earnings 
the realized and unrealized losses discussed above  that contributed to lower net income and book value per common share as of and for the year and quarter ended december   were negatively impacted as a result of a confluence of several factors  including i a historical rally in us treasuries during the year leading to the lowest yield ever on the year treasury note  which contributed to perceived higher future prepayment experience for the company s ios  ii continued uncertainty and concerns of systemic risk related to the european sovereign debt crisis  and iii uncertainty resulting from the implementation of harp ii  with the intent of increasing significantly the number of homeowners eligible to refinance their mortgage under this program and thus  further elevating fears of higher prepayment speeds 
each of these factors contributed to a significant widening of credit spreads and global market uncertainty during the second half of  which in turn  negatively impacted the pricing of our clos  agency ios and multi family cmbs at december  however  while the markets anticipated an escalation in prepayment speeds  the company s actual prepayment experience during the last four months have not indicated significant increases in speeds  although management anticipates prepayment speeds increasing in the near term

the net interest spread is impacted by factors such as our cost of financing  the interest rate that our investments bear and our interest rate hedging strategies

non gaap financial measures in addition to disclosing financial results calculated in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principals gaap  we also present non gaap financial measures that exclude certain items 
these measures include net interest spread core interest earning assets and net income excluding management contract termination and unrealized gains and losses associated with agency io investments 
these non gaap financial measures are provided to enhance the user s overall understanding of our financial performance 
specifically  management believes the non gaap financial measures provide useful information to investors by excluding or adjusting certain items affecting reported operating results that were unusual or not indicative of our core operating results 
the non gaap financial measures presented by the company should not be considered a substitute for  or superior to  the financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap 
moreover  these non gaap financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
the non gaap financial measures included in this filing have been reconciled to the nearest gaap measure 
comparative net interest spread core interest earning assets  a non gaap financial measure net interest spread core interest earning assets is a non gaap financial measure and is defined as gaap net interest spread plus unconsolidated investments in interest earning assets  such as our investments in a limited partnership and limited liability company 
our investment in limited partnership represents our equity investment in a limited partnership that owns a pool of residential whole mortgage loans and from which we receive distributions equal to principal and interest payments and sales net of certain administrative expenses 
our investment in a limited liability company includes interest income from our share of two tranches of securitized debt net of certain administrative costs 
because the income we receive from our investments in a limited partnership and limited liability company include interest from pools of mortgage loans  management considers the investment to be a functional equivalent to its interest earning assets under gaap 
in order to evaluate the effective net interest income of our investments  management uses net interest spread core interest earning assets to reflect the net interest spread of our investments as adjusted to reflect the addition of unconsolidated investments in interest earning assets 
management believes that net interest spread core interest earning assets provides useful information to investors as the income stream from this unconsolidated investment is similar to the net interest spread for our interest earning assets 
net interest spread core interest earning assets should not be considered a substitute for our gaap based calculation of net interest spread 
the following tables reconcile our gaap net interest spread for our portfolio of interest earning assets for the years ended december  and  respectively  to our non gaap measure of net interest spread core interest earning assets

net income excluding management contract termination and unrealized gains and losses associated with agency io investments during the quarter and year ended december   we incurred a one time million termination fee in connection with our termination of the hcs advisory agreement and experienced unusually excessive market volatility that impacted unrealized gains and losses on our agency ios and related hedges

liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements  including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings  fund and maintain investments  comply with margin requirements  fund our operations  pay management  incentive and consulting fees  pay dividends to our stockholders and other general business needs 
our investments and assets generate liquidity on an ongoing basis through principal and interest payments  prepayments  net earnings retained prior to payment of dividends and distributions from unconsolidated investments 
in addition  depending on market conditions  the sale of investment securities or capital market transactions may provide additional liquidity 
however  our intention is to meet our liquidity needs through normal operations with the goal of avoiding unplanned sales of assets or emergency borrowing of funds 
we fund our investments and operations through a balanced and diverse funding mix  which includes short term repurchase agreement borrowings  short term structured debt and longer term debt  such as our trust preferred debentures and  prior to their redemption  our convertible preferred debentures 
at december   we had cash balances of million 
the reduction in cash and cash equivalents from million at december  reflects the use of additional capital in to acquire our targeted assets 
we rely primarily on repurchase agreements to finance the mortgage backed securities in our investment portfolio 
as of december   we have outstanding repurchase agreements  a form of collateralized short term borrowing  with five different financial institutions 
these agreements are secured by certain of our investment securities and bear interest rates that have historically moved in close relationship to libor 
our borrowings under repurchase agreements are based on the fair value of our investment securities portfolio 
interest rate changes and increased prepayment activity can have a negative impact on the valuation of these securities  reducing the amount we can borrow under these agreements 
moreover  our repurchase agreements allow the counterparties to determine a new market value of the collateral to reflect current market conditions and because these lines of financing are not committed  the counterparty can call the loan at any time 
if a counterparty determines that the value of the collateral has decreased  the counterparty may initiate a margin call and require us to either post additional collateral to cover such decrease or repay a portion of the outstanding borrowing in cash  on minimal notice 
moreover  in the event an existing counterparty elected to not renew the outstanding balance at its maturity into a new repurchase agreement  we would be required to repay the outstanding balance with cash or proceeds received from a new counterparty or to surrender the mortgage backed securities that serve as collateral for the outstanding balance  or any combination thereof 
if we are unable to secure financing from a new counterparty and had to surrender the collateral  we would expect to incur a loss 
in addition  in the event one of our lenders under the repurchase agreement defaults on its obligation to re sell or return to us the securities that are securing the borrowings at the end of the term of the repurchase agreement  we would incur a loss on the transaction equal to the amount of haircut associated with the repurchase agreement 
at december   the company had short term borrowings or repurchase agreements of million as compared to million as of december  the increase of million is primarily due to our investment in agency ios in in addition to our excess cash  the company has million in unencumbered securities  including million of rmbs  of which million are agency rmbs 
there is million in restricted cash available to meet additional margin calls as it relates to the repurchase agreements secured by our agency ios 
at december   we also had longer term debt  including cdos outstanding of million and subordinated debt of million 
the cdos are collateralized by the mortgage loans held in securitization trusts 
based on our current investment portfolio  new investment initiatives  leverage ratio and available and future possible borrowing arrangements  we believe our existing cash balances  funds available under our current repurchase agreements and cash flows from operations will meet our liquidity requirements for at least the next months 
our leverage ratio for our investment portfolio  which we define as our outstanding indebtedness under repurchase agreements divided by stockholders equity  was to at december  we have continued to utilize significantly less leverage than our previously targeted leverage due to the ongoing repositioning of our investment portfolio to a more diversified portfolio that includes elements of credit risk with reduced leverage 
as of december   we have provided invested capital of million towards our agency io strategy and million to rbcm in connection with our multi family cmbs investments 
we also purchased an additional million of cmbs through rbcm that settled in the first quarter of we funded these investments primarily with proceeds from our december capital raise  excess working capital and short term borrowings 
we anticipate continuing to contribute additional capital toward the acquisition of these assets in the future from either working capital liquidity or proceeds from capital market transactions or a combination thereof 
certain of our hedging instruments may also impact our liquidity 
we use eurodollar or other futures contracts to hedge interest rate risk associated with our investments in agency ios 
with respect to futures contracts  initial margin deposits will be made upon entering into futures contracts and can be either cash or securities 
during the period the futures contract is open  changes in the value of the contract are recognized as unrealized gains or losses by marking to market on a daily basis to reflect the market value of the contract at the end of each day s trading 
we may be required to satisfy variation margin payments periodically  depending upon whether unrealized gains or losses are incurred 
we also use tbas to hedge interest rate risk and spread risk associated with our investments in agency ios 
since delivery for these securities extends beyond the typical settlement dates for most non derivative investments  these transactions are more prone to market fluctuations between the trade date and the ultimate settlement date  and thereby are more vulnerable  especially in the absence of margin arrangements with respect to these transactions  to increasing amounts at risk with the applicable counterparties 
we also use us treasury securities and us treasury futures and options to hedge interest rate risk associated with our investments in agency ios and interest rate swap agreements as a mechanism to reduce the interest rate risk of our agency arms and mortgage loans held in securitization trusts 
we also own approximately million of loans held for sale  which are included in discontinued operations 
our inability to sell these loans at all or on favorable terms could adversely affect our profitability as any sale for less than the current reserved balance would result in a loss 
currently  these loans are not financed or pledged 
as it relates to loans sold previously under certain loan sale agreements by our discontinued mortgage lending business  we may be required to repurchase some of those loans or indemnify the loan purchaser for damages caused by a breach of the loan sale agreement 
we have a reserve of approximately million 
we paid quarterly cash dividends of   and per common share in january  april  june  and october  respectively 
on december   we declared a fourth quarter cash dividend of per common share and a special cash dividend of per common share 
the dividend was paid on january  to common stockholders of record as of december  each of these dividends was paid out of our working capital 
we expect to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock during the near term 
however  our board of directors will continue to evaluate our dividend policy each quarter and will make adjustments as necessary  based on a variety of factors  including  among other things  the need to maintain our reit status  our financial condition  liquidity  earnings projections and business prospects 
our dividend policy does not constitute an obligation to pay dividends  which only occurs when our board of directors declares a dividend 
on june   we entered into an underwriting agreement relating to the offer and sale of  shares of our common stock at a public offering price of per share  which shares were issued and proceeds received on july  on july   we issued an additional  shares of common stock to the underwriter pursuant to their exercise of an over allotment option 
we received total net proceeds of million from the issuance of the  shares 
on december   we entered into an underwriting agreement relating to the offer and sale of  shares of our common stock at a public offering price of per share  which shares were issued and proceeds received on december  on december   we issued an additional  shares of common stock to the underwriter pursuant to their exercise of an over allotment option 
we received total net proceeds of million from the issuance of the  shares 
we intend to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the various requirements to maintain our reit status and to minimize or avoid corporate income tax and the nondeductible excise tax 
however  differences in timing between the recognition of reit taxable income and the actual receipt of cash could require us to sell assets or to borrow funds on a short term basis to meet the reit distribution requirements and to minimize or avoid corporate income tax and the nondeductible excise tax 
at december   hypotheca capital  llc  one of our trss  had approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards that will expire in through the internal revenue code places certain limitations on the annual amount of net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized if certain changes in the company s ownership occur 
the company has undergone an ownership change within the meaning of irc section that will limit the net loss carryforwards to be used to offset future taxable income to  per year 
hypotheca capital  llc  one of our trss  is presently undergoing an irs examination for the taxable years ended december  and exposure to european financial counterparties we finance the acquisition of a significant portion of our mortgage backed securities with repurchase agreements 
in connection with these financing arrangements  we pledge our securities as collateral to secure the borrowing 
the amount of collateral pledged will typically exceed the amount of the financing with the extent of over collateralization ranging from of the amount borrowed in the case of agency arm collateral to up to in the case of clo collateral 
while our repurchase agreement financing results in us recording a liability to the counterparty in our consolidated balance sheet  we are exposed to the counterparty  if during the term of the repurchase agreement financing  a lender should default on its obligation and we are not able to recover our pledged assets 
the amount of this exposure is the difference between the amount loaned to us plus interest due to the counterparty and the fair value of the collateral pledged by us to the lender including accrued interest receivable on such collateral 
several large european banks have experienced financial difficulty and have been either rescued by government assistance or by other large european banks 
some of these banks have us banking subsidiaries which have provided repurchase agreement financing or interest rate swap agreements to us in connection with the acquisition of various investments  including mortgage backed securities investments 
we have entered into repurchase agreements with credit suisse first boston llc a subsidiary of credit suisse group ag  which is domiciled in switzerland in the amount of million at december  we have outstanding interest rate swap agreements with barclays bank plc domiciled in the united kingdom as a counterparty in the amount of million notional with a net exposure of million 
in addition  certain of our us based counterparties may have significant exposure to european sovereign debt which could impact their future lending activities or cause them to default under agreements with us 
any counterparty defaults could result in a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we refer you to note  financing arrangements  portfolio investments  included in item of this annual report on form k 
inflation for the periods presented herein  inflation has been relatively low and we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations 
the impact of inflation is primarily reflected in the increased costs of our operations 
virtually all our assets and liabilities are financial in nature 
our consolidated financial statements and corresponding notes thereto have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
as a result  interest rates and other factors influence our performance far more than inflation 
inflation affects our operations primarily through its effect on interest rates  since interest rates typically increase during periods of high inflation and decrease during periods of low inflation 
during periods of increasing interest rates  demand for mortgages and a borrower s ability to qualify for mortgage financing in a purchase transaction may be adversely affected 
during periods of decreasing interest rates  borrowers may prepay their mortgages  which in turn may adversely affect our yield and subsequently the value of our portfolio of mortgage assets

further  we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do we have any commitment or intent to provide funding to any such entities 
significant estimates and critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap  which requires the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts 
these estimates are based  in part  on our judgment and assumptions regarding various economic conditions that we believe are reasonable based on facts and circumstances existing at the time of reporting 
the results of these estimates affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities and accumulated other comprehensive income at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of income  expenses and other comprehensive income during the periods presented 
changes in the estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on these financial statements 
accounting policies and estimates related to specific components of our consolidated financial statements are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with sec guidance  those material accounting policies and estimates that we believe are most critical to an investor s understanding of our financial results and condition and which require complex management judgment are discussed below 
revenue recognition 
interest income on our mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities is a combination of the interest earned based on the outstanding principal balance of the underlying loan security  the contractual terms of the assets and the amortization of yield adjustments  principally premiums and discounts  using generally accepted interest methods 
the net gaap cost over the par balance of self originated loans held for investment and premium and discount associated with the purchase of mortgage backed securities and loans are amortized into interest income over the lives of the underlying assets using the effective yield method 
adjustments to amortization are made for actual prepayment activity 
estimating prepayments and the remaining term of our interest yield investments require management judgment  which involves  among other things  consideration of possible future interest rate environments and an estimate of how borrowers will react to those environments  historical trends and performance 
the actual prepayment speed and actual lives could be more or less than the amount estimated by management at the time of origination or purchase of the assets or at each financial reporting period 
with respect to derivative instruments that have not been designated as hedges  any fluctuations in the fair value will be recognized in current earnings 
fair value 
the company has established and documented processes for determining fair values 
fair value is based upon quoted market prices  where available 
if listed prices or quotes are not available  then fair value is based upon internally developed models that primarily use inputs that are market based or independently sourced market parameters  including interest rate yield curves 
such inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement 
the company s ios and pos are considered to be the most significant of its fair value estimates 
mortgage loans held in securitization trusts impaired loans net 
impaired mortgage loans held in the securitization trusts are recorded at amortized cost less specific loan loss reserves

the company s valuation methodologies are described in note fair value of financial instruments included in item of this annual report on form k variable interest entities an entity is referred to as a variable interest entity vie if it meets at least one of the following criteria the entity has equity that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support of other parties  or as a group  the holders of the equity investment at risk lack a the power to direct the activities of an entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance  b the obligation to absorb the expected losses  or c the right to receive the expected residual returns  or have disproportional voting rights and the entity s activities are conducted on behalf of the investor that has disproportionally few voting rights 
the company consolidates a vie when it has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the vie and a right to receive benefits or absorb losses of the entity that could be potentially significant to the vie 
the company is required to reconsider its evaluation of whether to consolidate a vie each reporting period  based upon changes in the facts and circumstances pertaining to the vie 
fair value option the fair value option provides an election that allows companies to irrevocably elect fair value for financial assets and liabilities on an instrument by instrument basis at initial recognition 
changes in fair value for assets and liabilities for which the election is made will be recognized in earnings as they occur

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  credit spreads and equity prices 
all of our market risk sensitive assets  liabilities and related derivative positions are for non trading purposes only 
management recognizes the following primary risks associated with our business and the industry in which we conduct business interest rate risk liquidity risk prepayment risk credit risk fair value risk the following analysis includes forward looking statements that assume that certain market conditions occur 
actual results may differ materially from these projected results due to changes in our portfolio assets and borrowings mix and due to developments in the domestic and global financial and real estate markets 
developments in the financial markets include the likelihood of changing interest rates and the relationship of various interest rates and their impact on our portfolio yield  cost of funds and cash flows 
the analytical methods that we use to assess and mitigate these market risks should not be considered projections of future events or operating performance 
interest rate risk interest rates are sensitive to many factors  including governmental  monetary  tax policies  domestic and international economic conditions  and political or regulatory matters beyond our control 
changes in interest rates affect the value of the financial assets we manage and hold in our investment portfolio  the variable rate borrowings we use to finance our portfolio  and the interest rate swaps and caps  eurodollar and other futures  tbas and other securities or instruments we use to hedge our portfolio 
as a result  our net interest income is particularly affected by changes in interest rates 
for example  we hold rmbs some of which may have interest coupons that reset on various dates that are not matched to the reset dates on our repurchase agreements 
in general  the re pricing of our repurchase agreements occurs more quickly than the re pricing of our assets 
thus  it is likely that our floating rate borrowings may react to changes in interest rates before our rmbs because the weighted average next re pricing dates on the related borrowings may have shorter time periods than that of the rmbs 
in addition  the interest rates on our agency arms backed by hybrid arms may be limited to a periodic cap or an increase of typically or per adjustment period  while our borrowings do not have comparable limitations 
changes in interest rates can directly impact prepayment speeds  thereby affecting our net return on rmbs 
during a declining interest rate environment  the prepayment of rmbs may accelerate as borrowers may opt to refinance at a lower rate causing the amount of liabilities that have been extended by the use of interest rate swaps to increase relative to the amount of rmbs  possibly resulting in a decline in our net return on rmbs as replacement rmbs may have a lower yield than those being prepaid 
conversely  during an increasing interest rate environment  rmbs may prepay slower than expected  requiring us to finance a higher amount of rmbs than originally forecast and at a time when interest rates may be higher  resulting in a decline in our net return on rmbs 
accordingly  each of these scenarios can negatively impact our net interest income 
we seek to manage interest rate risk in the portfolio by utilizing interest rate swaps  caps  eurodollar and other futures  options and us treasury securities with the goal of optimizing the earnings potential while seeking to maintain long term stable portfolio values 
we continually monitor the duration of our mortgage assets and have a policy to hedge the financing such that the net duration of the assets  our borrowed funds related to such assets  and related hedging instruments  are less than one year 
in addition  we utilize tbas to mitigate the risks on our long agency rmbs positions associated with our investments in agency ios 
we utilize a model based risk analysis system to assist in projecting portfolio performances over a scenario of different interest rates 
the model incorporates shifts in interest rates  changes in prepayments and other factors impacting the valuations of our financial securities and instruments  including mortgage backed securities  repurchase agreements  interest rate swaps and interest rate caps  tbas and eurodollar futures based on the results of the model  instantaneous changes in interest rates would have had the following effect on net interest income for the next months based on our assets and liabilities as of december  dollar amounts in thousands changes in net interest income changes in interest rates changes in net interest income interest rate changes may also impact our net book value as our mortgage assets and related hedge derivatives are marked to market each quarter 
generally  as interest rates increase  the value of our mortgage assets  other than ios  decreases  and conversely  as interest rates decrease  the value of such investments will increase 
the value of an io will likely be negatively affected in a declining interest rate environment due to the risk of increasing prepayment rates because the ios value is wholly contingent on the underlying mortgage loans having an outstanding balance 
in general  we expect that  over time  decreases in value of our portfolio attributable to interest rate changes will be offset  to the degree we are hedged  by increases in value of our interest rate swaps or other financial instruments used for hedging purposes  and vice versa 
however  the relationship between spreads on securities and spreads on our hedging instruments may vary from time to time  resulting in a net aggregate book value increase or decline 
that said  unless there is a material impairment in value that would result in a payment not being received on a security or loan  changes in the book value of our portfolio will not directly affect our recurring earnings or our ability to make a distribution to our stockholders 
liquidity risk liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements  including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings  fund and maintain investments  pay dividends to our stockholders and other general business needs 
we recognize the need to have funds available to operate our business 
it is our policy to have adequate liquidity at all times 
we plan to meet liquidity through normal operations with the goal of avoiding unplanned sales of assets or emergency borrowing of funds 
our principal sources of liquidity are the repurchase agreements on our mortgage backed securities  the cdos we have issued to finance our loans held in securitization trusts  the principal and interest payments from our assets and cash proceeds from the issuance of equity securities as market and other conditions permit 
we believe our existing cash balances and cash flows from operations will be sufficient for our liquidity requirements for at least the next months 
as it relates to our investment portfolio  derivative financial instruments we use to hedge interest rate risk subject us to margin call risk 
if the value of our pledged assets decrease  due to a change in interest rates  credit characteristics  or other pricing factors  we may be required to post additional cash or asset collateral  or reduce the amount we are able to borrow versus the collateral 
for example  under our interest rate swaps typically we pay a fixed rate to the counterparties while they pay us a floating rate 
if interest rates drop below the fixed rate we are paying on an interest rate swap  we may be required to post cash margin 
prepayment risk when borrowers repay the principal on their mortgage loans before maturity or faster than their scheduled amortization  the effect is to shorten the period over which interest is earned  and therefore  reduce the yield for mortgage assets purchased at a premium to their then current balance  as with the majority of our assets 
conversely  mortgage assets purchased for less than their then current balance exhibit higher yields due to faster prepayments 
furthermore  prepayment speeds exceeding or lower than our modeled prepayment speeds impact the effectiveness of any hedges we have in place to mitigate financing and or fair value risk 
generally  when market interest rates decline  borrowers have a tendency to refinance their mortgages  thereby increasing prepayments 
the impact of increasing prepayment rates  whether as a result of declining interest rates  government intervention in the mortgage markets or otherwise  is particularly acute with respect to our agency ios 
because the value of an io security is wholly contingent on the underlying mortgage loans having an outstanding principal balance  an unexpected increase in prepayment rates on the pool of mortgage loans underlying the ios could significantly negatively impact the performance of our agency ios 
our modeled prepayments will help determine the amount of hedging we use to off set changes in interest rates 
if actual prepayment rates are higher than modeled  the yield will be less than modeled in cases where we paid a premium for the particular mortgage asset 
conversely  when we have paid a premium  if actual prepayment rates experienced are slower than modeled  we would amortize the premium over a longer time period  resulting in a higher yield to maturity 
in an increasing prepayment environment  the timing difference between the actual cash receipt of principal paydowns and the announcement of the principal paydown may result in additional margin requirements from our repurchase agreement counterparties 
we mitigate prepayment risk by constantly evaluating our mortgage assets relative to prepayment speeds observed for assets with a similar structure  quality and characteristics 
furthermore  we stress test the portfolio as to prepayment speeds and interest rate risk in order to further develop or make modifications to our hedge balances 
historically  we have not hedged of our liability costs due to prepayment risk 
credit risk credit risk is the risk that we will not fully collect the principal we have invested in mortgage loans or other assets  such as non agency rmbs  cmbs  and clos  due to borrower defaults 
our portfolio of loans held in securitization trusts as of december  consisted of approximately million of securitized first liens originated in and earlier 
the securitized first liens were principally originated in by one of our subsidiaries prior to our exit from the mortgage lending business 
these are predominately high quality loans with an average loan to value ltv ratio at origination of approximately  and average borrower fico score of approximately in addition  approximately of these loans were originated with full income and asset verification 
while we feel that our origination and underwriting of these loans will help to mitigate the risk of significant borrower default on these loans  we cannot assure you that all borrowers will continue to satisfy their payment obligations under these loans and thereby avoid default 
as of december  the company owns million of first loss cmbs comprised of pos that are backed by commercial mortgage loans on multi family properties at a weighted average amortized purchase price of approximately of current par 
the overall return of these securities will be dependent on the performance of the underlying loans and accordingly  management has taken an appropriate credit reserve when determining the amount of discount to accrete into income over time 
in addition  we owned approximately million on non agency rmbs senior securities 
the non agency rmbs has a weighted average amortized purchase price of approximately of current par value 
management believes the purchase price discount coupled with the credit support within the bond structure protects us from principal loss under most stress scenarios for these non agency rmbs 
as of december   we own approximately million of notes issued by a clo at a discounted purchase price equal to of par 
the securities are backed by a portfolio of middle market corporate loans 
fair value risk changes in interest rates also expose us to market value fair value fluctuation on our assets  liabilities and hedges 
while the fair value of the majority of our assets that are measured on a recurring basis are determined using level fair values  we own certain assets  such as our cmbs  for which fair values may not be readily available if there are no active trading markets for the instruments 
in such cases  fair values would only be derived or estimated for these investments using various valuation techniques  such as computing the present value of estimated future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved 
however  the determination of estimated future cash flows is inherently subjective and imprecise 
minor changes in assumptions or estimation methodologies can have a material effect on these derived or estimated fair values 
our fair value estimates and assumptions are indicative of the interest rate environments as of december   and do not take into consideration the effects of subsequent interest rate fluctuations 
we note that the values of our investments in derivative instruments  primarily interest rate hedges on our debt  will be sensitive to changes in market interest rates  interest rate spreads  credit spreads and other market factors 
the value of these investments can vary and has varied materially from period to period 
the following describes the methods and assumptions we use in estimating fair values of our financial instruments fair value estimates are made as of a specific point in time based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques 
these techniques involve uncertainties and are significantly affected by the assumptions used and the judgments made regarding risk characteristics of various financial instruments  discount rates  estimate of future cash flows  future expected loss experience and other factors 
changes in assumptions could significantly affect these estimates and the resulting fair values 
derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and  in many cases  could not be realized in an immediate sale of the instrument 
also  because of differences in methodologies and assumptions used to estimate fair values  the fair values used by us should not be compared to those of other companies 
the fair values of the company s rmbs and cdos are generally based on market prices provided by dealers who make markets in these financial instruments 
if the fair value of a security is not reasonably available from a dealer  management estimates the fair value based on characteristics of the security that the company receives from the issuer and on available market information 
the fair value of mortgage loans held in securitization trusts is estimated using pricing models and taking into consideration the aggregated characteristics of groups of loans such as  but not limited to  collateral type  index  interest rate  margin  length of fixed rate period  life cap  periodic cap  underwriting standards  age and credit estimated using the estimated market prices for similar types of loans 
the fair value of our cmbs is based on management s estimates using pricing models and inputs from current market conditions including recent transactions 
our cmbs investments were acquired in private transactions and are not actively traded in the secondary markets 
however similar assets are issued on a periodic basis that allows management to assess current market conditions when formulating a model evaluation 
the table below presents the sensitivity of the market value and net duration changes of our portfolio as of december   using a discounted cash flow simulation model assuming an instantaneous interest rate shift 
application of this method results in an estimation of the fair market value change of our assets  liabilities and hedging instruments per basis point bp shift in interest rates 
the use of hedging instruments is a critical part of our interest rate risk management strategies  and the effects of these hedging instruments on the market value of the portfolio are reflected in the model s output 
this analysis also takes into consideration the value of options embedded in our mortgage assets including constraints on the re pricing of the interest rate of assets resulting from periodic and lifetime cap features  as well as prepayment options 
assets and liabilities that are not interest rate sensitive such as cash  payment receivables  prepaid expenses  payables and accrued expenses are excluded 
changes in assumptions including  but not limited to  volatility  mortgage and financing spreads  prepayment behavior  defaults  as well as the timing and level of interest rate changes will affect the results of the model 
therefore  actual results are likely to vary from modeled results 
market value changes changes in interest rates changes in market value net duration amounts in thousands years years base years years it should be noted that the model is used as a tool to identify potential risk in a changing interest rate environment but does not include any changes in portfolio composition  financing strategies  market spreads or changes in overall market liquidity 
although market value sensitivity analysis is widely accepted in identifying interest rate risk  it does not take into consideration changes that may occur such as  but not limited to  changes in investment and financing strategies  changes in market spreads and changes in business volumes 
accordingly  we make extensive use of an earnings simulation model to further analyze our level of interest rate risk 
there are a number of key assumptions in our earnings simulation model 
these key assumptions include changes in market conditions that affect interest rates  the pricing of arm products  the availability of investment assets and the availability and the cost of financing for portfolio assets 
other key assumptions made in using the simulation model include prepayment speeds and management s investment  financing and hedging strategies  and the issuance of new equity 
we typically run the simulation model under a variety of hypothetical business scenarios that may include different interest rate scenarios  different investment strategies  different prepayment possibilities and other scenarios that provide us with a range of possible earnings outcomes in order to assess potential interest rate risk 
the assumptions used represent our estimate of the likely effect of changes in interest rates and do not necessarily reflect actual results 
the earnings simulation model takes into account periodic and lifetime caps embedded in our assets in determining the earnings at risk
