item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the risks described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks not presently known to us or that we do not currently consider significant may also have an adverse effect on us 
if any of the risks below actually occur  our business  results of operations  cash flows or financial condition could suffer 
our performance may be affected by general economic conditions and the continued global financial difficulties 
our performance is subject to worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer spending 
over the past four years economic conditions have deteriorated significantly followed by a weak recovery and such economic conditions may remain depressed  or be subject to further deterioration 
some of the factors that are having an impact on discretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions  employment  consumer debt  reductions in net worth based on securities market declines  residential real estate and mortgage markets  taxation  healthcare costs  fuel and energy prices  interest rates  credit availability  consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors 
the worldwide apparel industry is heavily influenced by general economic cycles 
apparel retailing is a cyclical industry that is heavily dependent upon the overall level of consumer spending 
purchases of specialty apparel and related goods tend to be highly correlated with the cycles of the levels of disposable income of consumers 
as a result  any substantial deterioration in general economic conditions could materially and adversely affect our net sales and results of operations 
downturns  or the expectation of a downturn  in general economic conditions could materially and adversely affect consumer spending patterns  our sales and our results of operations 
consumer purchases of discretionary items generally decline during recessionary periods and other periods where disposable income is adversely affected 
the downturn in the economy may continue to affect consumer purchases of our merchandise and have an adverse impact on our sales  results of operations and cash flow 
because apparel generally is a discretionary purchase  declines in consumer spending may have a more negative effect on apparel retailers than on other retailers 
we may not be profitable if there is a decline in consumer spending 
the turmoil in the financial markets in resulted in extreme volatility in security prices and diminished liquidity and credit availability  and there can be no assurance that our liquidity will not be affected by changes in the financial markets and the global economy 
tightening of the credit markets and future turmoil in the financial markets could also make it more difficult for us to access funds  to refinance our existing indebtedness if necessary  to enter into agreements for new indebtedness  or to obtain funding through the issuance of our securities 
in addition  the effect from the credit crisis had a significant negative impact on businesses around the world  and the potential impact of this crisis  or potential future crises  on our suppliers cannot be predicted 
the inability of suppliers to access liquidity  or the insolvency of suppliers  could lead to their failure to deliver our merchandise 
worsening economic conditions could also result in difficulties for financial institutions including bank failures and other parties that we may do business with  which could potentially impair our ability to access financing under existing arrangements or to otherwise recover amounts as they become due under our other contractual arrangements 
additionally  either as a result of  or independent of  the current financial difficulties and economic weakness in the united states  material fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a negative impact on our business 
our comparable sales and quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future and  as a result  the market price of our common stock may fluctuate or decline substantially 
our comparable sales and quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future and are affected by a variety of factors  including the opening of new stores  the closing of existing stores  and the success of our leased department and licensed relationships  the timing of new store openings and leased department and licensed brand business openings  the timing of the fulfillment of purchase orders under our product and license arrangements  the extent of cannibalization of sales volume of some of our existing retail locations by our new retail locations opened in the same geographic markets or by our internet sales  changes in our merchandise mix  any repositioning of our brands  general economic conditions and  in particular  the retail sales environment  calendar shifts  including shifts of holiday or seasonal periods  or shifts in the number of weekend days occurring in a given calendar period  changes in pregnancy rates and birth rates  actions of competitors  the level of success and or actions of anchor tenants where we have stores or leased department and licensed relationships  fashion trends  and weather conditions and seasonality 
if  at any time  our comparable sales or quarterly results of operations decline or do not meet the expectations of investors  the price of our common stock could decline substantially 
our share price may be volatile and could decline substantially 
the market price of our common stock has been  and is expected to continue to be  volatile  both because of actual and perceived changes in our financial results and prospects  and because of general volatility in the stock market 
the factors that could cause fluctuations in our share price may include  among other factors discussed in this section  the following actual or anticipated variations in the financial results and prospects of our business or other companies in the retail business  changes in financial estimates by wall street research analysts  actual or anticipated changes in the united states economy or the retailing environment  changes in the market valuations of other specialty apparel or retail companies  announcements by our competitors or us  additions and departures of key personnel  changes in accounting principles  the passage of legislation or other developments affecting us or our industry  the trading volume of our common stock in the public market  changes in economic conditions  financial market conditions  natural disasters  terrorist acts  acts of war or periods of civil unrest  and the realization of some or all of the risks described in this section entitled risk factors 
in addition  the stock markets have experienced significant price and trading volume fluctuations from time to time  and the market prices of the equity securities of retailers have been extremely volatile and are sometimes subject to sharp price and trading volume changes 
these broad market fluctuations may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we may not be successful in maintaining and expanding our business and opening new retail locations 
any future growth depends significantly on our ability to successfully establish and operate new stores including destination maternity combo stores and superstores on a profitable basis  our ability to successfully establish new  and to maintain our current  leased department and licensed relationships  and to operate such leased department and licensed relationships on a profitable basis  and the success and profitability of our international business  including our ability to successfully establish new  and to maintain our current  international franchising relationships 
this growth  if it occurs  will place increased demands on our management  operational and administrative resources 
these increased demands and operating complexities could cause us to operate our business less effectively  which  in turn  could cause a deterioration in our financial performance and negatively impact our growth 
any planned growth will also require that we continually monitor and upgrade our management information and other systems  as well as our distribution infrastructure 
our ability to establish and operate new stores and our leased department and licensed relationships successfully depends on many factors  including  among others  our ability to identify and obtain suitable store locations  including mall locations  the availability of which is outside of our control  retain existing  expand existing and establish new leased department and licensed relationships  negotiate favorable lease terms for stores  including desired tenant improvement allowances  negotiate favorable lease terminations for existing store locations in markets where we intend to open new destination maternity combo stores or superstores  source sufficient levels of inventory to meet the needs of new stores and our leased department and licensed relationships  successfully address competition  merchandising and distribution challenges  and hire  train and retain a sufficient number of qualified store personnel 
the success and profitability of our international business depends on many factors  including  among others our ability to retain our current international franchisees and our ability to identify and reach agreement with new international franchisees  the ability of our franchisees to identify and obtain suitable store locations  including mall locations  the availability of which is outside of their control  the ability of our franchisees to negotiate favorable lease terms for stores  including desired tenant improvement allowances  our ability to source sufficient levels of inventory to meet the needs of our franchisees international operations  our ability and the ability of our franchisees to successfully address competition  merchandising and distribution challenges  and the ability of our franchisees to hire  train and retain a sufficient number of qualified store personnel 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to grow our business and achieve our goals 
even if we succeed in establishing new stores  further developing our leased department and licensed relationships and further expanding our international relationships  we cannot assure that these initiatives will achieve planned revenue or profitability levels in the time periods estimated by us  or at all 
if any of these initiatives fails to achieve or is unable to sustain acceptable revenue and profitability levels  we may incur significant costs 
for example  in connection with our new broad based partnership with bed bath beyond inc and its subsidiary  buy buy baby  inc  which we announced in may we discontinued operation of our remaining leased departments in babies r us in october and opened leased departments in select buybuy baby stores 
although we are confident that the new relationship with bed bath beyond inc and buy buy baby  inc will be a profitable one for our company and our stockholders  there is no guarantee of success 
our business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted at any time by a significant number of competitors 
we operate in a highly competitive environment characterized by few barriers to entry 
we compete against department stores  specialty retail chains  discount stores  independent retail stores and catalog and internet based retailers 
many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater financial and other resources than us 
further  we do not typically advertise using television and radio media and thus do not reach customers through means our competitors may use 
our mid and luxury priced merchandise faces a highly fragmented competitive landscape that includes locally based  single unit retailers  as well as a handful of multi unit maternity operations  none of which we believe have more than stores nationwide 
in the value priced maternity apparel business  we face competition on a nationwide basis from retailers such as gap  h m  old navy  target and wal mart 
in addition  with our exit from babies r us in late october in connection with our new broad based partnership with bed bath beyond inc and its subsidiary  buy buy baby  inc  in november  toys r us  inc announced that it had entered into a partnership with thyme maternity  a canada based company  for a collection of maternity apparel and accessories to be featured in approximately babies r us stores in the united states 
substantially all of these competitors also sell maternity apparel on their websites 
our business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected by this competition  including the potential for increased competition in the future 
for example  the maternity apparel business has previously experienced oversupply conditions due to increased competition in the maternity apparel business  which resulted in a greater level of industry wide markdowns and markdowns recognized by us on sales from our retail locations 
there can be no assurance that these conditions will not occur again or worsen 
our relationships with third party retailers may not be successful 
we cannot guarantee successful results from or the continuation of our leased department and licensed relationships with third party retailers such as macy s  sears  buybuy baby  gordmans  boscov s and kohl s 
under our agreement with kohl s  subject to certain notice obligations  kohl s is not obligated to purchase any maternity apparel from us and we are not obligated to sell any maternity apparel to them 
we do not control the pricing terms or the timing or degree of the markdowns at kohl s 
under our agreements with our leased department partners  those partners do not make any promises or representations as to the potential amount of business we can expect from the sale of our product in their stores 
for example  as we previously announced  we discontinued offering maternity apparel in our remaining babies r us locations in october in connection with our new broad based partnership with bed bath beyond inc and its subsidiary  buy buy baby  inc the success of our leased department and licensed brand businesses is highly dependent on the actions and decisions of the third party retailers  which are outside of our control 
the retailers could limit the merchandise carried  close stores  go out of business or terminate their agreements with us 
our failure to properly manage our leased department and licensed brand businesses including any failure by us in timely delivering goods to any third party retailer or any failure to respond to the actions of  or changes in  business conditions at third party retailers would have a direct impact on the profitability and continuation of these relationships 
our business depends on sustained demand for maternity clothing and is sensitive to birth rates  women s fashion trends  economic conditions and consumer spending 
our business depends upon sustained demand for maternity clothing 
our future performance will be subject to a number of factors beyond our control  including demographic changes  fashion trends  economic conditions and consumer spending 
if demand for maternity clothing were to decline for any reason  such as a decrease in the number of pregnancies  our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
for example  according to the united states census bureau and united states centers for disease control and prevention  births declined in calendar compared to calendar  declined in calendar compared to calendar  and declined a total of from calendar to mid calendar if this trend were to continue it could negatively affect our business and results of operations 
additionally  our operating results could be materially and adversely affected if certain non maternity women s apparel fashions have a more pregnancy friendly fit 
for example  in fiscal  we were negatively impacted by the popularity of certain styles in the non maternity women s apparel market  such as trapeze and baby doll dresses and tops  which can more readily fit a pregnant woman early in her pregnancy than typical non maternity fashions 
downturns  or the expectation of a downturn  in general economic conditions could materially and adversely affect consumer spending patterns  our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the specialty apparel retail business historically has been subject to cyclical variations 
consumer purchases of specialty apparel products  including maternity wear  may decline during recessionary periods and at other times when disposable income is lower 
declines in consumer spending patterns may have a more negative effect on apparel retailers than some other retailers 
therefore  we may not be able to maintain our historical sales and earnings  or remain as profitable  if there is a decline in consumer spending patterns 
a prolonged economic downturn could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 
we may not be successful in maintaining and expanding our marketing partnership programs 
we cannot guarantee successful results from the continuation of  or the expansion of  our marketing partnership programs which utilize our opt in customer database and various in store marketing initiatives 
the success of our marketing partnership programs is highly dependent on the actions and decisions of the third party consumer products companies to whom we provide these services 
should these third party consumer products companies decide to limit the services provided by us  go out of business or terminate their agreements with us  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
further  there is no guarantee that we will be able to expand this part of our business through agreements with new third parties 
in addition  our ability to provide the services is dependent on our successful collection of opt in customer data as well as applicable law relating to the collection and transfer of the personally identifiable information of our customers 
a failure on our part to collect adequate amounts of customer data or any change in state  local or federal law which further restricts our ability to collect this information could cause us to terminate or limit the services we can provide to the third party consumer products companies and would ultimately adversely affect our revenue from these relationships 
further  although we believe there may be an opportunity to more actively market our full customer database to a much broader range of consumer products and services companies that market to families with children  we cannot guarantee that these efforts will be successful 
we require a significant amount of cash to pay quarterly dividends as well as to fund our operations and future growth 
our ability to pay quarterly dividends  as well as to fund our operations and future growth  depends upon our ability to generate cash 
our success in generating cash depends upon the results of our operations and the amount of cash we use in investing activities  as well as upon general economic  financial  competitive and other factors beyond our control 
an inability to generate sufficient cash could have important consequences 
for example  it could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors  limit our ability to borrow money  make it more difficult for us to open new stores or improve or expand existing stores  restrict our ability to pay dividends or make distributions to our stockholders  require us to incur significant additional indebtedness  and make it more difficult for us to pursue strategic acquisitions  alliances and partnerships 
our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk  which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 
any borrowings under our new revolving credit facility  which could significantly increase in the future  would bear interest at a variable rate 
we have exposure for the variable interest rate borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
as a result  an increase in interest rates could result in a substantial increase in interest expense  especially if our borrowings under our revolving credit facility increase 
we are heavily dependent on our management information systems and our ability to maintain and upgrade these systems from time to time 
the efficient operation of our business is heavily dependent on our internally developed management information systems mis 
in particular  we rely on point of sale terminals  which provide information to our customized merchandise analysis and planning system used to track sales and inventory  and we rely on our internet websites through which we sell merchandise to our customers 
the merchandise analysis and planning system helps integrate our design  manufacturing  distribution and financial functions  and also provides daily financial and merchandising information 
although our software programs and data are backed up and securely stored off site  our servers and computer systems are located at our headquarters in philadelphia  pennsylvania 
these systems and our operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire  flood and other natural disasters  power loss  computer systems failures  internet and telecommunications or data network failure  operator negligence  improper operation by or supervision of employees  physical and electronic loss of data or security breaches  misappropriation and similar events  and computer viruses 
any disruption in the operation of our mis  the loss of employees knowledgeable about such systems or our failure to continue to effectively modify such systems could interrupt our operations or interfere with our ability to monitor inventory  which could result in reduced net sales and affect our operations and financial performance 
in addition  any interruption in the operation of our internet websites could cause us to lose sales due to the inability of customers to purchase merchandise from us through our websites during such interruption 
we also need to ensure that our systems are consistently adequate to handle our anticipated business growth and are upgraded as necessary to meet our needs 
the cost of any such system upgrades or enhancements could be significant 
as a result  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if our servers and systems were inoperable or inaccessible 
from time to time  we improve and upgrade our mis and the functionality of our internet websites 
if we are unable to maintain and upgrade our systems or internet websites  or to integrate new and updated systems or changes to our internet websites in an efficient and timely manner  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
a cybersecurity incident could have a negative impact 
a cyber attack may bypass the security for our mis causing an mis security breach and leading to a material disruption of our mis and or the loss of business information and or internet sales 
such a cyber attack could result in any of the following theft  destruction  loss  misappropriation or release of confidential data or intellectual property  operational or business delays resulting from the disruption of mis and subsequent clean up and mitigation activities  negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with our customers  partners or industry peers  and loss of sales generated through our internet websites through which we sell merchandise to customers  to the extent these websites are affected by a cyber attack 
as a result  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
as an apparel retailer  we rely on numerous third parties in the supply chain to produce and deliver the products that we sell  and our business may be negatively impacted by disruptions in the supply chain 
if we lose the services of one or more of our significant suppliers or one or more of them fail to meet our product needs  we may be unable to obtain replacement merchandise in a timely manner 
if our existing suppliers cannot meet our increased needs and we cannot locate alternative supply sources  we may be unable to obtain sufficient quantities of the most popular items at attractive prices  which could negatively impact our sales and results of operations 
we obtain apparel and other merchandise from foreign sources  both purchased directly in foreign markets and indirectly through domestic vendors with foreign sources 
to the extent that any of our vendors are located overseas or rely on overseas sources for a large portion of their products  any event causing a disruption of imports  including the imposition of import restrictions  could harm our ability to source product 
this disruption could materially limit the merchandise that we would have available for sale and reduce our sales and earnings 
the flow of merchandise from our vendors could also be materially and adversely affected by financial or political instability  or war  in or affecting any of the countries in which the goods we purchase are manufactured or through which they flow 
trade restrictions in the form of tariffs or quotas  embargoes and customs restrictions that are applicable to the products that we sell also could affect the import of those products and could increase the cost and reduce the supply of products available to us 
any material increase in tariff levels  or any material decrease in quota levels or available quota allocation  could negatively impact our business 
further  changes in tariffs or quotas for merchandise imported from individual foreign countries could lead us to shift our sources of supply among various countries 
any such shift we undertake in the future could result in a disruption of our sources of supply and or an increase in product costs  and lead to a reduction in our sales and earnings 
supply chain security initiatives undertaken by the united states government that impede the normal flow of product could also negatively impact our business 
in addition  decreases in the value of the united states dollar against foreign currencies could increase the cost of products that we purchase from overseas vendors 
we also face a variety of other risks generally associated with relying on vendors that do business in foreign markets and import merchandise from abroad  such as political instability or the threat of terrorism  particularly in countries where our vendors source merchandise  enhanced security measures at united states and foreign ports  which could delay delivery of imports  imposition of new or supplemental duties  taxes and other charges on imports  delayed receipt or non delivery of goods due to the failure of foreign source suppliers to comply with applicable import regulations  delayed receipt or non delivery of goods due to organized labor strikes or unexpected or significant port congestion at united states ports  and local business practice and political issues  including issues relating to compliance with domestic or international labor standards  which may result in adverse publicity 
the united states may impose new initiatives that adversely affect the trading status of countries where apparel is manufactured 
these initiatives may include retaliatory duties or other trade sanctions that  if enacted  would increase the cost of products imported from countries where our vendors acquire merchandise 
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we could be materially and adversely affected if our distribution operations were disrupted 
to support our distribution of product throughout the world  we operate our main distribution facility and one significantly smaller distribution facility  both in philadelphia  pennsylvania 
finished garments from contractors and other manufacturers are inspected and stored for distribution 
we do not have other distribution facilities to support our distribution needs 
if our main philadelphia distribution facility were to shut down or otherwise become inoperable or inaccessible for any reason such as  for example  due to natural disasters  like the recent hurricane sandy  which affected our region in early fiscal  we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with the distribution of our products to our stores and to our third party retailers during the time it takes to reopen or replace this facility 
in light of our strategic emphasis on rapid replenishment as a competitive strength  a distribution disruption might have a disproportionately adverse effect on our operations and profitability relative to other retailers 
in addition  the loss or material disruption of service from any of our shippers for any reason  whether due to freight difficulties  strikes  natural disaster or other difficulties at our principal transport providers or otherwise  could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to obtain sufficient raw materials or maintain satisfactory manufacturing arrangements 
we do not own any manufacturing facilities and therefore depend on third parties to manufacture our products 
we place our orders for production of merchandise and raw materials by purchase order and do not have any long term contracts with any manufacturer or supplier 
we compete with many other companies for production facilities and raw materials 
furthermore  we have received in the past  and may receive in the future  shipments of products from manufacturers that fail to conform to our quality control standards or environmental standards 
in such event  unless we are able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner  we may lose sales 
we have no ability to control the environmental compliance including compliance with climate change requirements of these third party manufacturers 
if we fail to maintain favorable relationships with these third parties  or if we cannot obtain an adequate supply of quality raw materials on commercially reasonable terms  it could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
fluctuations in commodity prices could result in an increase in component costs  delivery costs  and overall product costs 
the results of our business operations could suffer due to significant increases or volatility in the prices of certain commodities  including but not limited to cotton  wool and other ingredients used in the production of fabric and accessories  as well as fuel  oil and natural gas 
in addition  increases in the price of food and food commodities may result in increased labor rates related to textile and apparel production 
increases in prices of these commodities or other inflationary pressures may result in significant cost increases for our raw materials  product components and finished products  as well as increases in the cost of distributing merchandise to our retail locations and shipping products to our customers 
for example  in the latter part of fiscal and for most of fiscal  we experienced product cost of sales increases due  in part  to the increased cost of cotton as well as  to a lesser extent  increased labor rates in certain production countries 
to the extent we are unable to offset any such increased costs through value engineering and similar initiatives  or through price increases  our profitability  cash flows and financial condition may be materially and adversely impacted 
if we choose to increase prices to offset the increased costs  our unit sales volumes could be adversely impacted 
our stores are heavily dependent on the customer traffic generated by shopping malls 
we depend heavily on locating our stores in successful shopping malls in order to generate customer traffic 
we cannot control the development of new shopping malls  the availability or cost of appropriate locations within existing or new shopping malls or the success of existing or new mall stores 
the success of all of our mall stores will depend  in part  on the ability of each mall s anchor tenants  such as large department stores  other tenants and area attractions to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores  and the continuing popularity of malls as shopping destinations 
many traditional enclosed malls are experiencing significantly lower levels of customer traffic than in the past  driven by overall poor economic conditions as well as the closure of certain mall anchor tenants 
sales volume and mall traffic may be materially and adversely affected by economic downturns in a particular area  the closing of anchor tenants or competition from non mall retailers and other malls where we do not have stores 
our success depends on our ability to identify and rapidly respond to fashion trends 
the apparel industry is subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and shifting consumer demands 
accordingly  our success depends on the priority that our target customers place on fashion and our ability to anticipate  identify and capitalize upon emerging fashion trends 
our ability or our failure to anticipate  identify or react appropriately to changes in styles or trends could lead to  among other things  excess inventories and higher markdowns  as well as the decreased appeal of our brands 
particular fashion trends  or an inaccuracy of our forecasts regarding fashion trends  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  in fiscal we were negatively impacted from the popularity of certain styles in the non maternity women s apparel market  such as trapeze and baby doll dresses and tops  which can more readily fit a pregnant woman early in her pregnancy than typical non maternity fashions 
the failure to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified senior management personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business requires disciplined execution at all levels of our organization in order to timely deliver and display fashionable merchandise in appropriate quantities in our stores 
this execution requires experienced and talented management 
we currently have a management team with a great deal of experience with us and in apparel retailing 
if we were to lose the benefit of this experience  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  as our business expands  we believe that our success will depend greatly on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel 
there is a high level of competition for personnel in the retail industry 
like most retailers  we experience significant employee turnover rates  particularly among store sales associates and managers  and our continued growth will require us to hire and train even more new personnel 
we therefore must continually attract  hire and train new personnel to meet our staffing needs 
we constantly compete for qualified personnel with companies in our industry and in other industries 
a significant increase in the turnover rate among our sales associates and managers would increase our recruiting and training costs and could decrease our operating efficiency and productivity 
if we are unable to retain our employees or attract  train  assimilate or retain other skilled personnel in the future  we may not be able to service our customers as effectively  which could impair our ability to increase sales and could otherwise harm our business 
our quarterly operating results and inventory levels may fluctuate significantly as a result of seasonality in our business 
our business  like that of other retailers  is seasonal 
results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
quarterly results may fluctuate materially depending upon  among other things  increases or decreases in comparable sales  the timing of new retail location openings  the timing of retail location closings  net sales and profitability contributed by new retail locations  the timing of the fulfillment of purchase orders under our product and license arrangements  adverse weather conditions  shifts in the timing of certain holidays and promotions  changes in inventory and production levels and the timing of deliveries of inventory  and changes in our merchandise mix 
our quarterly net sales have historically been highest in our third fiscal quarter  corresponding to the peak spring selling season 
given the historically higher sales level in our third fiscal quarter and the relatively fixed nature of most of our operating expenses and interest expense  we have typically generated a very significant percentage of our full year operating income and net income during our third fiscal quarter 
thus  any factors which result in a material reduction of our sales for the third quarter could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for our fiscal year as a whole 
seasonal fluctuations in sales also affect our inventory levels  as we usually order merchandise in advance of peak selling periods and sometimes before new fashion trends are confirmed by customer purchases 
we must carry a significant amount of inventory  especially before the peak spring selling season 
if we are not successful in selling our inventory during this period  we may be forced to rely on markdowns or promotional sales to sell the excess inventory or we may not be able to sell the inventory at all  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if an independent manufacturer violates labor or other laws  or is accused of violating any such laws  or if their labor practices diverge from those generally accepted as ethical  it could harm our business and brand image 
while we maintain policies and guidelines with respect to labor practices that independent manufacturers that produce goods for us are contractually required to follow  and while we have an independent firm and company employees inspect certain manufacturing sites to monitor compliance  we cannot control the actions of such manufacturers or the public s perceptions of them  nor can we assure that these manufacturers will conduct their businesses using ethical or legal labor practices 
apparel companies can be held jointly liable for the wrongdoings of the manufacturers of their products 
while many of our independent manufacturers are routinely monitored by buying representatives  who assist us in the areas of compliance  garment quality and delivery  we do not control the manufacturers business practices or their employees employment conditions  and manufacturers act in their own interest which may be in a manner that results in negative public perceptions of us  and or employee allegations against us  or court determinations that we are jointly liable 
violations of law by our importers  buying agents  manufacturers or distributors could result in delays in shipments and receipt of goods and could subject us to fines or other penalties  any of which could restrict our business activities  increase our operating expenses or cause our sales to decline 
we may be unable to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property and may be subject to liability if we are alleged to have infringed on another party s intellectual property 
we believe that our trademarks  service marks and other intellectual property are important to our continued success and our competitive position due to their recognition with our customers 
we devote substantial resources to the establishment and protection of our trademarks  service marks and other intellectual property 
although we actively protect our intellectual property  there can be no assurance that the actions that we have taken to establish and protect our trademarks  service marks and other intellectual property  including our rights in our management information systems and our proprietary rights in products for which we have applied for or received patent protection for example  our secret fit belly innovation  will be adequate to prevent imitation of our marks  products or services by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as a violation of their trademarks  service marks or other proprietary rights 
for example  in october we filed a lawsuit against target corporation and others for infringement of our proprietary patented secret fit belly technology 
there is no guarantee that this effort to enforce our rights will be successful 
also  others may assert rights in  or ownership of  our trademarks and other proprietary rights or may allege that we have or are infringing on their intellectual property rights and we may not be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our trademarks and proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
we cannot assure you that these registrations will prevent imitation of our name  merchandising concept  store design or private label merchandise  or the infringement of our other intellectual property rights by others 
imitation of our name  concept  store design or merchandise in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation of our brand image could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  the high expense in both prosecuting and defending against  and potential liability related to  alleged infringements of intellectual property rights could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if climate change laws or regulations were to become applicable to our business  or if any third party with whom we have a leased or licensed relationship imposed reporting or other obligations on us due to their own compliance programs  we could incur additional expense to meet the requirements and our failure to comply could have a material adverse effect on our business 
with respect to manufacturing within the united states  united states environmental protection agency epa greenhouse gas ghg emission reporting rules require certain united states manufacturers to report ghg emissions 
these rules are unlikely to require reporting of our third party contract apparel manufacturers because the amount of emissions from retail stores and apparel manufacturing facilities are currently estimated to be below the epa reporting threshold 
with respect to manufacturing outside of the united states  international treaties  such as the kyoto protocol and the copenhagen protocol  do not currently require the countries in which our non united states contract apparel manufacturers are located to control ghg emissions and it is unlikely that climate change requirements in the foreseeable future will require significant ghg emission reductions on our non united states contract apparel manufacturers 
our manufacturers are required to follow all applicable laws  including climate change laws 
if domestic or international laws or regulations were expanded to require ghg emission reporting or reduction by us or our third party contract apparel manufacturers  or if we engage third party contract manufacturers in countries that have existing ghg emission reporting or reduction laws or regulations  we would need to expend financial and other resources to comply with such regulations and or monitor our third party contract apparel manufacturers compliance with such regulations 
in addition  we cannot control the actions of our third party manufacturers or the public s perceptions of them  nor can we assure that these manufacturers will conduct their businesses using climate change proactive or sustainable practices 
violations of climate change laws or regulations by third parties with whom we do business could result in negative public perception of us and or delays in shipments and receipt of goods  and could subject us to fines or other penalties  any of which could restrict our business activities  increase our operating expenses or cause our sales to decline 
some retailers have adopted sustainability or other policies that encourage or require suppliers to report and or reduce ghg emissions 
no third party with whom we have a leased or licensed relationship currently requires us to report ghg emissions to them 
however  we expect that certain of these third parties may do so in the future  which would require us to expend financial and other resources to comply with such requirements 
in addition  if such requirements are imposed on us  our relationship with such third parties could be damaged if we were unable to comply 
changes in the health care regulatory environment could cause us to incur additional expense and our failure to comply with related legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in  the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of were signed into law in the united states 
this legislation expands health care coverage to many uninsured individuals and expands coverage to those already insured 
the changes required by this legislation could cause us to incur additional health care and other costs  but we do not expect any material short term impact on our financial results as a result of the legislation 
the costs and other effects of other new legal requirements cannot be determined with certainty 
for example  new legislation or regulations may result in increased costs directly for our compliance or indirectly to the extent such requirements increase prices of goods and services because of increased compliance costs or reduced availability of raw materials 
war or acts of terrorism or the threat of either may negatively impact availability of merchandise and otherwise adversely impact our business 
in the event of war or acts of terrorism  or if either is threatened  our ability to obtain merchandise available for sale and consumer demand for our merchandise may be negatively affected 
a substantial portion of our merchandise is imported from other countries 
in addition  we not only generate sales in the united states and canada through our own retail locations  but also in foreign countries through our international franchise relationships 
if goods become difficult or impossible to import into the united states  and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs  our sales and profit margins may be materially and adversely affected 
further  if consumer demand in any country where we do business is negatively affected  our sales in such country would suffer 
in the event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed  our business may be materially and adversely impacted  as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to our main distribution facility and retail locations  as well as fulfilling internet orders 
the terms of our debt instruments impose financial and operating restrictions 
our new credit facility contains restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long term best interests 
these covenants limit or restrict  among other things  our ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends or make other distributions in respect of our equity securities  or purchase or redeem capital stock  or make certain investments  have our subsidiaries pay dividends  make loans or transfer assets to us  sell assets  including the capital stock of our subsidiaries  enter into any transactions with our affiliates  transfer any capital stock of any subsidiary or permit any subsidiary to issue capital stock  create liens  enter into certain sale leaseback transactions  effect a consolidation or merger or transfer of all or substantially all of our assets  and engage in other lines of business unless reasonably related to our existing business 
these limitations and restrictions may materially and adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our best interests 
in addition  our ability to borrow under the credit facility is subject to borrowing base requirements 
if we breach any of the covenants in our credit facility  we may be in default under our credit facility 
if we default  the lender under our credit facility could declare all borrowings owed to them  including accrued interest and other fees  to be due and payable 
our charter documents contain certain anti takeover provisions  and we are entitled to certain other protective provisions under delaware law 
we are a delaware corporation and the anti takeover provisions of delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of the company  even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders 
we also have adopted a stockholder rights plan  commonly known as a poison pill  that entitles our stockholders to acquire additional shares of us  or a potential acquirer of us  at a substantial discount to their market value in the event of an attempted takeover 
in addition  our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition involving us that our stockholders may consider favorable by  among other things authorizing the issuance of preferred stock  the terms of which may be determined at the discretion of our board of directors  restricting the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders  and establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at meetings 
these provisions may also reduce the market value of our common stock 
if we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at intended levels or if our board of directors decides to reduce the level of our dividend  our reputation and stock price may be harmed 
our quarterly cash dividend is currently per common share 
the dividends declared and paid by us to date meet all requirements under the terms of our debt agreements and applicable law  however  any future payment of dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and the ability to pay any such future dividends  or to pay such dividends at the current level  will be based upon certain restrictive financial covenants  earnings  capital requirements and our financial condition  among other factors  at the time any such dividend is considered 
in addition  our ability or decision to pay dividends at all or at the current level may be subject to certain economic  financial  competitive and other factors such as the level of taxation of dividends that are beyond our control 
our board of directors may  at its discretion  decrease the intended level of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time 
any failure to pay dividends after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation and investor confidence in us  and may also negatively impact our stock price 
the increase in our sales and marketing efforts that target markets outside the united states and canada expose us to additional risks associated with international operations 
although an immaterial amount of our sales are currently derived from international sales outside of canada  we are actively seeking to expand our international presence  and we have begun to do so through franchise arrangements in the middle east  india and south korea 
we may not be successful in these efforts 
international operations and sales subject us to risks and challenges that we would otherwise not face if we conducted our business only in the united states 
for example  we may depend on third parties to market our products through foreign sales channels  and we may be challenged by laws and business practices favoring local competitors 
in addition  our ability to succeed in foreign markets will depend on our ability to protect our intellectual property 
we must also adapt our pricing structure to address different pricing environments and may face difficulty in enforcing revenue collection internationally 
emerging markets are a significant focus of our international growth strategy 
the developing nature of these markets presents a number of risks 
deterioration of social  political  labor or economic conditions in a specific country or region and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations may also materially and adversely affect our operations or financial results or those of our franchisees 
operations outside the united states may be affected by changes in trade protection laws  policies and measures  and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment  including the foreign corrupt practices act and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments 
to the extent we achieve significant sales outside of the united states in the future  we may have significant exposure to fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates 
we could have failures in our system of internal controls causing us to inaccurately report our financial results or to fail to prevent fraud 
we maintain a documented system of internal controls which is reviewed and monitored by management  who meet regularly with our audit committee of the board of directors 
we believe we have a well designed system to maintain adequate internal controls over the business 
we cannot assure you that there will not be any control deficiencies in the future 
should we become aware of any control deficiencies  we would report them to the audit committee and  if significant  recommend prompt remediation 
we devote significant resources to document  test  monitor and improve our internal controls and will continue to do so  however  we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that our controls are adequate in the future or that adequate controls will be effective in preventing fraud 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud 
any failures in the effectiveness of our internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results or cause us to fail to meet reporting obligations

item properties we own our principal executive offices and distribution facility  which is located at north fifth street  philadelphia  pennsylvania 
this facility consists of approximately  square feet  of which approximately  square feet is dedicated to office space and the remaining square footage is used for finished goods warehousing and distribution 
in august  we entered into a ten year lease  with renewal options for two successive five year terms  for a facility located at kitty hawk avenue  philadelphia  pennsylvania in the philadelphia naval business center 
in may  we amended the lease to extend the initial term for one additional year to august the area leased at this facility  which we use for some finished goods warehousing and distribution  raw material cutting and warehousing  and office space consists of approximately  square feet of space  of which  square feet is dedicated to office space 
from time to time we may also utilize third party warehousing services in the philadelphia  pennsylvania area when we have increased storage requirements 
these services essentially operate on a month to month basis 
we believe that these facilities will be adequate to support our anticipated distribution needs for the near term and  potentially  longer 
in the event we need additional space to meet our future distribution needs  we believe that such space would be readily available 
our facilities are subject to state and local regulations that range from building codes to health and safety regulations 
we lease our store premises for initial terms averaging from five to ten years 
certain leases allow us to terminate or reduce our obligations at specified points in time in the event that the applicable store does not achieve a specified sales volume 
some of our store leases also provide for contingent payments based on sales volume  escalations of the base rent  as well as increases in operating costs  marketing costs and real estate taxes 
as of september   the following numbers of store leases are set to expire as listed in the table below 
we do not expect the expiration of any leases to have a material adverse impact on our business or operations 
fiscal year leases expire number of stores and later total in addition to the stores we operate  we have arrangements with department and specialty stores  including macy s  sears  buybuy baby  gordmans and boscov s to operate maternity apparel departments in their stores 
these leased departments typically involve the lease partner collecting all of the revenue from the leased department 
the revenue is remitted to us  less a fixed percentage of the net sales earned by the lease partner as stipulated in the agreement 
we provide at least some amount of staffing for each of the leased departments  with the amount varying depending on the specific arrangement 
generally  under each of our leased department agreements  our lease partner has the right to terminate any or all of our rights to operate our leased departments in their stores subject to varying notice requirements 
item legal proceedings from time to time  we are named as a defendant in legal actions arising from our normal business activities 
litigation is inherently unpredictable and although the amount of any liability that could arise with respect to currently pending actions cannot be accurately predicted  we do not believe that the resolution of any pending action will have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity

we provide these non gaap financial measures and ratios to investors to assist them in performing their analysis of our historical operating results 
the non gaap financial measures and ratios included in other consolidated financial data reflect a measure of our operating results before consideration of certain charges and consequently  none of these measures and ratios should be construed as an alternative to net income loss or operating income loss as an indicator of our operating performance  or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity  as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles

year ended september  compared to year ended september  net sales 
our net sales for fiscal decreased by or million  to million from million for fiscal comparable sales decreased during fiscal versus a comparable sales increase of during fiscal the decrease in total reported sales for fiscal compared to fiscal resulted primarily from decreased sales related to our continued efforts to close underperforming stores and decreased sales from our licensed relationship  partially offset by increased sales due to the full year impact of the expansion of our maternity apparel leased department relationship with macy s in the second quarter of fiscal as of september   we operated a total of stores and  total retail locations motherhood maternity stores including motherhood maternity outlet stores  a pea in the pod stores  destination maternity stores  and  leased maternity apparel departments  of which were in sears stores under the two hearts maternity brand and the balance were in other department stores and baby specialty stores  primarily under the motherhood brand

our gross profit for fiscal decreased by  or million  to million compared to million for fiscal  and our gross profit as a percentage of net sales gross margin for fiscal was compared to for fiscal the decrease in gross profit for fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to our lower gross margin  and to a lesser extent  lower gross profit due to our decreased sales 
the decrease in gross margin for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to lower merchandise margin driven by higher product costs and somewhat higher levels of promotional activity and markdowns 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal decreased by  or million  to million from million for fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses was for both fiscal and fiscal the slight decrease in expense for fiscal compared to fiscal resulted primarily from lower expenses related to our continued efforts to close underperforming stores primarily payroll and occupancy costs  our continued tight expense controls  and lower variable incentive compensation expense  substantially offset by higher expenses related to the operation of our additional macy s leased department locations primarily payroll and employee benefit costs  and percentage of net sales occupancy payments to macy s and higher advertising and marketing expenses 
store closing  asset impairment and asset disposal expenses 
our store closing  asset impairment and asset disposal expenses for fiscal increased by approximately million  to million from million for fiscal  which primarily reflected higher impairment charges for write downs of long lived assets

we did not incur any restructuring and other charges in fiscal operating income 
our operating income for fiscal decreased by  or million  to million from million for fiscal operating income as a percentage of net sales for fiscal decreased to from for fiscal the decrease in operating income and operating income percentage was primarily due to our lower gross profit and lower gross margin 
interest expense  net 
our net interest expense for fiscal decreased by  or million  to million from million in fiscal this decrease was due to our lower debt level  primarily as a result of the million of term loan prepayments we made in fiscal and the million of term loan prepayments we made in fiscal  and to a lesser extent  lower interest rates 
during fiscal and  we did not have any direct borrowings under our credit facility and we did not have any direct borrowings outstanding as of september  loss on extinguishment of debt 
during fiscal  we prepaid million principal amount of our outstanding term loan  which resulted in pretax charges of  representing the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs 
during fiscal  we prepaid million principal amount of our outstanding term loan  which resulted in pretax charges totaling  income taxes 
for fiscal  our effective tax rate was compared to for fiscal our effective tax rate for fiscal was higher than the statutory federal tax rate of primarily due to the effect of state income taxes  net of federal tax benefit  and to a lesser extent  additional income tax expense including interest and penalties recognized as required by the accounting standard for uncertain income tax positions 
our effective tax rate for fiscal was slightly higher than the statutory federal tax rate of primarily due to the effect of state income taxes  net of federal benefit  on our pretax income for fiscal  partially offset by reductions of state income tax expense  net of federal expense  of million recorded in the second quarter of fiscal  which were related to settlements of uncertain income tax positions

our net sales for fiscal increased by or million  to million from million for fiscal comparable sales increased during fiscal versus a comparable sales decrease of during fiscal the increase in total reported sales for fiscal compared to fiscal resulted primarily from increased sales due to the expansion of our maternity apparel leased department relationship with macy s  partially offset by decreased sales related to our continued efforts to close underperforming stores 
as of september   we operated a total of stores and  total retail locations motherhood maternity stores including motherhood maternity outlet stores  a pea in the pod stores  destination maternity stores  and  leased maternity apparel departments  of which were in sears and kmart stores under the two hearts maternity brand and the balance were in other department stores and baby specialty stores  primarily under the motherhood brand 
in addition  our oh baby by motherhood collection is available at kohl s stores throughout the united states 
in comparison  as of september   we operated a total of stores and  total retail locations motherhood maternity stores including motherhood maternity outlet stores  a pea in the pod stores  destination maternity stores  and  leased maternity apparel departments 
the increase in leased department locations at september  versus september  predominantly reflects the opening of leased department locations in january and february for our macy s expansion  and an additional sears and kmart leased department locations in october as of september   our store total included destination maternity multi brand stores  including destination maternity combo stores and destination maternity superstores 
in comparison  as of september   we operated destination maternity multi brand stores  including destination maternity combo stores and destination maternity superstores 
during fiscal  we opened stores  including destination maternity stores  and closed stores  with of these store closings related to destination maternity store openings 
in addition  during fiscal  we opened leased department locations and closed leased department locations 
gross profit 
our gross profit for fiscal increased by  or million  to million compared to million for fiscal  and our gross profit as a percentage of net sales gross margin for fiscal was compared to for fiscal the increase in gross profit for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to our increased sales  partially offset by the slightly lower gross margin  which resulted primarily from higher promotional activity and markdowns  and to a much lesser extent  from higher product costs for fall merchandise 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased by  or approximately million  to million from million for fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal decreased to compared to for fiscal the increase in expense for fiscal compared to fiscal resulted primarily from higher expenses related to the launch and operation of our additional macy s leased department locations primarily payroll and employee benefit costs  and percentage of net sales occupancy payments to macy s and increased legal expenses  partially offset by lower variable incentive compensation expense and our continued expense control initiatives 
the decrease in expense percentage for fiscal reflects the favorable leverage from our increased sales and our continued expense control initiatives 
store closing  asset impairment and asset disposal expenses 
our store closing  asset impairment and asset disposal expenses for fiscal decreased by approximately million  to million from million for fiscal  which primarily reflected lower impairment charges for write downs of long lived assets 
restructuring and other charges 
in fiscal  we incurred pretax expense of million from our management transition 
in fiscal  we incurred pretax expense of million from our strategic restructuring  cost reduction and other initiatives  and our management transition 
see restructuring and other charges in this item below for a detailed description of these charges 
operating income 
our operating income for fiscal increased by  or million  to million from million for fiscal operating income as a percentage of net sales for fiscal increased to from for fiscal the increase in operating income was primarily due to our higher gross profit and significantly lower restructuring and other charges  partially offset by higher selling  general and administrative expenses 
the increase in operating income percentage was primarily due to our significantly lower restructuring and other charges 
interest expense  net 
our net interest expense for fiscal decreased by  or million  to million from million in fiscal this decrease was due to our lower debt level  primarily as a result of the million of term loan prepayments we made in fiscal and the million of term loan prepayments we made in fiscal  and to a much lesser extent  lower interest rates 
during fiscal  we did not have any direct borrowings under our credit facility and we did not have any direct borrowings outstanding as of september  during fiscal  our average daily level of direct borrowings under our credit facility was million 
loss on extinguishment of debt 
during fiscal  we prepaid million principal amount of our outstanding term loan  which resulted in pretax charges of  representing the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs 
during fiscal  we prepaid million principal amount of our outstanding term loan  which resulted in pretax charges totaling  income taxes 
for fiscal  our effective tax rate was compared to for fiscal our effective tax rate for fiscal was slightly higher than the statutory federal tax rate of primarily due to the effect of state income taxes  net of federal benefit  on our pretax income for fiscal  partially offset by reductions of state income tax expense  net of federal expense  of million recorded in the second quarter of fiscal  which were related to settlements of uncertain income tax positions 
our effective tax rate for fiscal was higher than the statutory federal tax rate of primarily due to the effect of state income taxes  net of federal benefit  and additional income tax expense including interest and penalties recognized as required by the accounting standard for uncertain income tax positions 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report  for the reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate

the objectives of our restructuring and cost reduction program were to improve and simplify critical processes  consolidate activities and infrastructure  and reduce our expense structure 
as of september   we had completed the planned activities of these initiatives and we incurred million of pretax expense substantially related to these initiatives in fiscal  primarily for consulting services 
these initiatives resulted in approximate pretax savings of million in fiscal  with incremental pretax savings of approximately million in fiscal and an additional approximately million in fiscal thus we estimated that we realized total pretax savings of approximately million in fiscal as a result of our cost reduction initiatives  which included the savings realized in fiscal and fiscal after his retirement on september   dan matthias  our former chief executive officer former ceo  agreed to continue to serve us as a director and as non executive chairman of the board of directors and agreed to remain available to us in an advisory capacity through september for these services  we agreed to pay the former ceo an annual retainer of  through september in november  the former ceo entered into a letter agreement with us  which confirmed that he would not seek reelection to the board of directors and  therefore  would no longer serve as our non executive chairman of the board after the expiration of his term in january the letter agreement did not change the terms of payment under the annual retainer for advisory services  however we incurred a pretax charge of million in fiscal  representing the amount due for the remaining term of the arrangement 
in connection with the retirement of rebecca matthias  our former president and chief creative officer  at the end of fiscal  we incurred a pretax charge of million in fiscal the charge reflects benefit costs related to an amendment to the executive s supplemental retirement agreement with us 
in april  we announced the hiring of chris daniel as our president effective june  in connection with our efforts to hire a new president  we incurred pretax charges of million in fiscal for relocation costs and million in fiscal  primarily for executive recruiting costs 
liquidity and capital resources our cash needs have primarily been for i debt service  including principal prepayments  ii capital expenditures  including leasehold improvements  fixtures and equipment for new stores  store relocations and expansions of our existing stores  as well as improvements and new equipment for our distribution and corporate facilities and information systems  and iii working capital  including inventory to support our business 
in addition  during the second quarter of fiscal  we initiated a regular quarterly cash dividend 
we have historically financed our capital requirements from cash flows from operations  borrowings under our credit facilities or available cash balances 
cash and cash equivalents increased by million during fiscal compared to a decrease of million during fiscal cash provided by operations of million for fiscal increased by million from million for fiscal this increase in cash provided by operations versus the prior year was the result of net working capital changes that provided cash in fiscal versus cash used in fiscal  partially offset by lower net income in fiscal compared to fiscal the net working capital changes were primarily i an increase in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities in fiscal  compared to a fiscal decrease that was primarily due to a million supplemental executive retirement plan serp benefit payment made in december  and ii a decrease in inventories in fiscal compared to an increase in fiscal  which reflects our efforts to tightly control our inventory levels in fiscal and the significant number of additional macy s leased department locations opened in fiscal during fiscal we used cash provided by operations to fund repayments of long term debt  to pay our quarterly cash dividends  and to pay for capital expenditures 
our million of repayments of long term debt in fiscal consisted predominantly of million in optional prepayments of our term loan 
in fiscal  we paid million in quarterly cash dividends 
for fiscal  we also spent million on capital expenditures  including million for leasehold improvements  fixtures and equipment for new store facilities  as well as improvements to existing stores  and million for our information systems and distribution and corporate facilities 
the remaining cash provided by operations during fiscal was used primarily to increase our available cash 
cash provided by operations of million for fiscal decreased by approximately million from million for fiscal this decrease in cash provided by operations versus the prior year was primarily the result of net working capital changes that used a greater amount of cash in fiscal than in fiscal  partially offset by higher pretax income in fiscal compared to fiscal the net working capital changes were primarily i a decrease in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities in fiscal  primarily due to the million serp benefit payment made in december and lower accrued variable incentive compensation expense  compared to a small increase in fiscal  and ii a larger increase in inventories in fiscal compared to fiscal  which reflects our increased number of leased department locations during fiscal and somewhat weaker than planned sales during fiscal  partially offset by iii a smaller increase in trade receivables in fiscal than in fiscal in addition to our cash provided by operations in fiscal  we withdrew million from our grantor trust  which was used to partially fund the million december serp benefit payment  and we generated million of cash from the proceeds of option exercises 
during fiscal we used cash provided by operations  cash provided by option exercises  and the withdrawal from the grantor trust to fund repayments of long term debt  to pay for capital expenditures  and to pay our quarterly cash dividends 
our million of repayments of long term debt in fiscal consisted predominantly of million of prepayments of our term loan  including a million prepayment required under the annual excess cash flow provision of the term loan 
for fiscal we spent million on capital expenditures  including million for leasehold improvements  fixtures and equipment principally for new store facilities  as well as improvements to existing stores  and million for our information systems and distribution and corporate facilities 
on november   we entered into a five year million senior secured revolving credit facility the credit facility  which replaced our former million credit facility 
the credit facility consists of two tranches a a senior secured revolving credit and letter of credit facility of up to million  tranche a and b a senior secured first in last out revolving credit facility of up to million tranche a 
the credit facility will mature on november  upon our request and with the consent of the lender  permitted borrowings under tranche a may be increased up to an additional million  in increments of million  up to a tranche a maximum limit of million 
proceeds from advances under the credit facility  with certain restrictions  may be used to repay our existing term loan or other debt  and to provide financing for working capital  letters of credit  capital expenditures  dividends  share repurchases and other general corporate purposes 
under the credit facility  we are required to maintain minimum excess availability as defined in the related credit facility agreement equal to of the borrowing base as defined in the related credit facility agreement 
the credit facility is secured by a security interest in our trade receivables  inventory  equipment  real estate interests  letter of credit rights  cash  intangibles and certain other assets 
prior to entering into the credit facility  we had in place a senior secured revolving credit facility the prior credit facility  which was amended on july  to decrease the maximum available for borrowings from million to million and to extend its maturity date from march  to january  the amendment also increased our effective interest rate on borrowings  if any  by approximately per annum 
there were no financial covenant requirements under the prior credit facility provided that excess availability as defined in the related prior credit facility agreement did not fall below of the borrowing base as defined in the related prior credit facility agreement 
if excess availability fell below of the borrowing base  we would have been required to meet a specified minimum fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the related prior credit facility agreement 
since the inception of the prior credit facility  we have exceeded the minimum requirements for excess availability under the prior credit facility and therefore  have not been subject to any financial covenants 
as of september   we had no outstanding borrowings under the prior credit facility and million in letters of credit  with million of availability under our prior credit facility  compared to no outstanding borrowings and million in letters of credit  with million of availability under our prior credit facility  as of september  borrowings under the prior credit facility as of september  would have borne interest at a rate of between approximately and per annum 
during fiscal and  we did not have any direct borrowings under the prior credit facility 
we may have borrowings under our new credit facility during certain periods of fiscal  reflecting seasonal and other timing variations in cash flow 
also  in november we had average outstanding borrowings of million under the credit facility that resulted from our need to deposit million with the agent bank for the prior credit facility as cash collateral on an interim basis while letters of credit issued under the prior credit facility are replaced with letters of credit issued under the credit facility see commercial commitments below 
as of september   we had in place an agreement the term loan agreement for our term loan 
on november   we prepaid the remaining term loan balance of million in connection with the execution of our new credit facility 
the interest rate on the term loan was equal to  at our election  either i the prime rate plus  or ii a libor rate plus an applicable margin 
the applicable margin was initially fixed at through and including the fiscal quarter ended september  thereafter  the applicable margin for libor rate borrowings was either or  depending on our consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the term loan agreement 
based upon our applicable quarterly consolidated leverage ratios  the applicable margin for libor rate borrowings was prior to december  and was reduced to effective from december  we were required to make minimum repayments of the principal amount of the term loan in quarterly installments of  each 
we were also required to make an annual principal repayment equal to or of excess cash flow as defined in the term loan agreement in excess of million for each fiscal year  with the or factor depending on our consolidated leverage ratio 
there was no required principal repayment related to fiscal results 
additionally  the term loan could be prepaid at our option  in part or in whole  at any time without any prepayment premium or penalty 
for fiscal we made the following prepayments million in the first quarter and million in the third quarter 
for fiscal we made the following prepayments million in the first quarter  representing the prepayment required under the annual excess cash flow provision of the term loan  and million in the third quarter 
at september   our indebtedness under the term loan agreement was million  which was prepaid on november  as described above 
the term loan agreement contained quarterly financial covenants that required us to maintain a specified maximum permitted consolidated leverage ratio and a specified minimum permitted consolidated interest coverage ratio as defined in the term loan agreement 
since the inception of the term loan agreement we were in compliance with all covenants of our term loan agreement 
in order to mitigate our floating rate interest risk on the variable rate term loan  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with the agent bank for the term loan that commenced on april   the date the term loan proceeds were received  and expired on april  the interest rate swap agreement enabled us to effectively convert a significant portion of the term loan equal to the notional amount of the interest rate swap from a floating interest rate libor plus prior to december   reduced to libor plus effective from december   based on our specified leverage ratios  to a fixed interest rate prior to december   reduced to effective from december   based on our specified leverage ratios 
the notional amount of the interest rate swap was million at the inception of the swap agreement and decreased over time to a notional amount of million at the expiration date of april  we have million outstanding under an industrial revenue bond irb at september  the irb has a variable interest rate that may be converted to a fixed interest rate at our option 
at any time prior to conversion to a fixed interest rate structure  bondholders may put back to us ie require us to repurchase all or part of the irb upon notice to the bond trustee  after which the remarketing agent would attempt to resell to third parties the put portion of the irb 
if the remarketing agent is unsuccessful in reselling the put portion of the irb  the bond trustee may then draw on a letter of credit issued under the credit facility to repurchase the put bonds from bondholders on our behalf 
during fiscal and bondholders put million and million  respectively  of the irb back to us  and these put bonds were successfully resold by the remarketing agent to third parties 
the letter of credit issued to secure the bonds has never been drawn upon 
in the event that the bondholders put the bonds back to us and the remarketing agent fails to resell the bonds  which we believe is unlikely  we expect the acceleration of the payment of the bonds would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity 
in march  we entered into supplemental executive retirement agreements  which have been periodically amended the serp agreements  with dan and rebecca matthias the serp executives 
we also have a grantor trust  which was established for the purpose of accumulating assets in anticipation of our payment obligations under the serp agreements the grantor trust 
our agreements with the serp executives and the trustee for the grantor trust the trustee allow us to make cash deposits to the grantor trust  or provide an irrevocable standby letter of credit the serp letter of credit to the trustee  in lieu of any deposits otherwise required  for funding obligations under the serp agreements 
in december  in connection with the additional vesting and scheduled payment of serp executives benefits in  we made a partial cash contribution to the grantor trust of million  with a corresponding reduction of the serp letter of credit to a total of million as of december  in december  we received a distribution of the remaining assets in the grantor trust totaling million 
the amount withdrawn was used to partially fund the million december lump sum payment of serp benefits to ms 
matthias 
as of september   the serp letter of credit was  which was equal to the remaining serp benefits paid to mr 
matthias on october  on january   we announced the initiation of a regular quarterly cash dividend 
during fiscal and we paid cash dividends of million reflecting four quarterly dividend payments or a total of per share and million reflecting three quarterly dividend payments or a total of per share  respectively 
on november  we declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share payable on december   which will require approximately million of available cash 
based on our current quarterly dividend rate of per share  we project that we will pay approximately million of cash dividends during fiscal our management believes that our current cash and working capital positions  expected operating cash flows and available borrowing capacity will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  debt repayments and dividend payments  as well as to fund stock repurchases and debt prepayments  if any  for at least the next twelve months 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments we have entered into agreements that create contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
these obligations and commitments will have an impact on future liquidity and the availability of capital resources 
the tables below set forth a summary of these obligations and commitments as of september  in thousands contractual obligations payments due by period description total obligations less than one year one to three years three to five years after five years long term debt interest related to long term debt operating leases purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations the amounts in this table exclude obligations under employment and retirement agreements

the amounts reflected include future minimum lease payments and exclude such direct operating costs 
our purchase orders with contract manufacturers are cancelable by us at any time prior to our acceptance of the merchandise  subject to negotiated payment of certain of vendors nonrecoverable costs 
the amount in this table excludes purchase orders for supplies in the normal course of business 
commercial commitments amount of commitment per period description total obligations less than one year one to three years three to five years after five years credit facility other standby letters of credit total commercial commitments consists of outstanding letter of credit commitments under our prior credit facility at september  as of november   million of letters of credit outstanding under the prior credit facility were in the process of being replaced with letters of credit issued under the new credit facility 
on november  the company deposited million with the agent bank for the prior credit facility as cash collateral during the transition process 
a prorata portion of the cash collateral will be released to the company after each of the original letters of credit are returned to the agent bank and cancelled 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
if actual results were to differ significantly from estimates made  future reported results could be materially affected 
however  we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results 
our senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and the related management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations with the audit committee of our board of directors 
inventories 
we value our inventories  which consist primarily of maternity apparel  at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on the first in  first out method fifo and includes the cost of merchandise  freight  duty and broker fees  as well as applied product related overhead 
a periodic review of inventory quantities on hand is performed in order to determine if inventory is properly valued at the lower of cost or market 
factors related to current inventories such as future consumer demand and fashion trends  current aging  current analysis of merchandise based on receipt date  current and anticipated retail markdowns or wholesale discounts  and class or type of inventory are analyzed to determine estimated net realizable values 
criteria utilized by us to determine the net realizable value of our inventories and the related level of required inventory reserves include factors such as the amount of merchandise received within the past twelve months  merchandise received more than one year before with quantities on hand in excess of twelve months of sales  and merchandise currently selling below cost 
a provision is recorded to reduce the cost of inventories to its estimated net realizable value  if required 
inventories as of september  and totaled million and million  respectively  representing and of total assets  respectively 
given the significance of inventories to our consolidated financial statements  the determination of net realizable values is considered to be a critical accounting estimate 
any significant unanticipated changes in the factors noted above could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and our reported operating results 
long lived assets 
our long lived assets consist principally of store leasehold improvements and furniture and equipment included in property  plant and equipment  net in our consolidated balance sheets and  to a much lesser extent  patent and lease acquisition costs included in other intangible assets  net in our consolidated balance sheets 
these long lived assets are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over the shorter of the lease term or their useful life 
net long lived assets as of september  and totaled million and million  respectively  representing and of total assets  respectively 
in assessing potential impairment of these assets  we periodically evaluate the historical and forecasted operating results and cash flows on a store by store basis 
newly opened stores may take time to generate positive operating and cash flow results 
factors such as i store type  that is  company store or leased department  ii store concept  that is  motherhood  pea or destination maternity  iii store location  for example  urban area versus suburb  iv current marketplace awareness of our brands  v local customer demographic data  vi anchor stores within the mall in which our store is located and vii current fashion trends are all considered in determining the time frame required for a store to achieve positive financial results  which is assumed to be within two years from the date a store location is opened 
if economic conditions are substantially different from our expectations  the carrying value of certain of our long lived assets may become impaired 
as a result of our impairment assessment  we recorded write downs of long lived assets of million and million during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
self insurance reserves 
we are primarily self insured for most workers compensation claims  general liability and automotive liability losses  and for healthcare claims 
we have purchased insurance coverage in order to establish certain limits to our exposure on a per claim basis and on an aggregate basis 
our accrued insurance expense  which was primarily for self insurance reserves  as of september  and totaled million and million  respectively  representing and of total assets  respectively 
the estimated reserves for our self insured liabilities and our reported operating results could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from the factors noted below 
we determine the estimated reserve required for workers compensation claims  general liability and automotive liability losses in each accounting period 
this requires that we determine estimates of the costs of claims incurred including claims incurred but not yet reported and accrue for such expenses in the period in which the claims are incurred including claims incurred but not yet reported 
actual workers compensation claims  and general liability and automotive liability losses  are reported to us by third party administrators 
the third party administrators also report initial estimates of related loss reserves 
the open claims and initial loss reserves and estimates of claims incurred but not yet reported are subjected to examination by us utilizing a consistent methodology which involves various assumptions  judgment and other factors 
such factors include  but are not limited to  the probability of settlement  the amount at which settlement can be achieved  the probable duration of the claim  the cost development pattern of the claim and the applicable cost development factor 
in addition  we utilize a cooperative arrangement with a number of other companies to assist in managing these insurance risks for certain occurrences prior to march  based on this arrangement  our expenses could be impacted by the loss history associated with the cooperative as a whole for the years for which we remain a participant 
the liabilities associated with claims for workers compensation  general liability and automotive liability are measured through the use of actuarial methods to project an estimate of ultimate cost for claims incurred 
we record an accrual for the estimated amount of self insured healthcare claims incurred but not yet reported using a method based on our historical claims experience 
the most significant factors in addition to our historical claims experience that impact the determination of the required accrual are the historical timing of claims processing  medical cost trends and inflation  employer employee cost sharing factors and changes in plan benefits 
we continually monitor historical experience and cost trends  and accruals are adjusted when warranted by changes in facts and circumstances 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure including interest and penalties together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation of property and equipment and valuation of inventories  for tax and accounting purposes 
we establish reserves for certain tax positions that we believe are supportable  but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority 
we determine our provision for income taxes based on federal  state and foreign tax laws and regulations currently in effect  some of which have been recently revised 
legislation changes in jurisdictions in which we operate  if enacted  could increase our transactions or activities subject to tax 
any such legislation that becomes law could result in an increase in our income tax expense and our income taxes paid  which could have a material and adverse effect on our net income or cash flow 
the temporary differences between the book and tax treatment of income and expenses result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
actual results could differ from our assessments if adequate taxable income is not generated in future periods 
net deferred tax assets as of september  and totaled million and million  respectively  representing and of total assets at september  and  respectively 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not more likely than not  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a future period  income tax expense will be impacted 
accounting for contingencies 
from time to time  we are named as a defendant in legal actions arising from our normal business activities 
we account for contingencies such as these in accordance with applicable accounting standards  which require us to record an estimated loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies arising from contractual or legal proceedings requires management  after consultation with outside legal counsel  to use its best judgment when estimating an accrual related to such contingencies 
as additional information becomes known  our accrual for a loss contingency could fluctuate  thereby creating variability in our results of operations from period to period 
likewise  an actual loss arising from a loss contingency which significantly exceeds the amount accrued for in our financial statements could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which such actual loss becomes known 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income 
asu no 
requires companies to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income either as one continuous statement or as two consecutive statements 
it eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of stockholders equity 
the standard does not change the items which must be reported in other comprehensive income 
asu no 
is effective for financial statements issued for annual reporting periods beginning after december  and interim periods within those years 
because this guidance impacts presentation only  the adoption of the new requirements of asu no 
will not have any impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued asu no 
 fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss 
the amendments in asu no 
result in common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss and change the wording used to describe many of the requirements in us gaap for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
the amendments do not require additional fair value measurements and are not intended to establish valuation standards or affect valuation practices outside of financial reporting 
asu no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
we have not entered into any market sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market interest rates 
the range of changes presented reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one year period 
as of september   we had cash equivalents of million 
our cash equivalents consist of investments in money market funds that bear interest at variable rates 
a change in market interest rates earned on our investments impacts the interest income and cash flows  but does not materially impact the fair market value of the financial instruments 
due to the average maturity and conservative nature of our investment portfolio  we believe a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of our investment portfolio 
the impact on our future interest income resulting from changes in investment yields will depend largely on the gross amount of our investment portfolio at that time 
however  based upon the conservative nature of our investment portfolio and current experience  we do not believe a decrease in investment yields would have a material negative effect on our interest income 
as of september   the principal components of our debt portfolio were the million term loan and the million prior credit facility  both of which were denominated in united states dollars 
on november   we entered into a new million credit facility  which replaced our prior credit facility 
both our prior credit facility and our new credit facility have variable interest rates that are tied to market indices 
as of september   we had no direct borrowings and million of letters of credit outstanding under our prior credit facility 
borrowings under the prior credit facility would have resulted in interest at a rate between approximately and per annum as of september  as of september   if the new credit facility had been in place at that date  tranche a borrowings under the new credit facility would have resulted in interest at a rate between approximately and per annum  and tranche a borrowings under the new credit facility would have resulted in interest at a rate between approximately and per annum 
interest on any future borrowings under the credit facility would  to the extent of outstanding borrowings  be affected by changes in market interest rates 
a change in market interest rates on the variable rate portion of our debt portfolio would impact the interest expense incurred and cash flows 
on november   we prepaid the remaining term loan balance of million in connection with the execution of the new credit facility 
based on the limited other variable rate debt included in our debt portfolio as of september   a basis point increase in interest rates would result in additional interest incurred for the year of less than million 
a basis point decrease in interest rates would correspondingly lower our interest expense for the year by less than million 
other than as described above  we do not believe that the market risk exposure on other financial instruments is material
