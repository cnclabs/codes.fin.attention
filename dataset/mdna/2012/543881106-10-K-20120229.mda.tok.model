table of contents overview businesses loral has two segments  satellite manufacturing and satellite services 
loral participates in satellite services operations principally through its ownership interest in telesat 
satellite manufacturing space systems loral  inc ss l is a designer  manufacturer and integrator of powerful satellites and satellite systems for commercial and government customers worldwide 
ss l s design  engineering and manufacturing capabilities have allowed it to develop a large portfolio of highly engineered  mission critical satellites and secure a strong industry presence 
this position provides ss l with the ability to produce satellites that meet a broad range of customer requirements for broadband internet service to the home  mobile video and internet service  broadcast feeds for television and radio distribution  phone service  civil and defense communications  direct to home television broadcast  satellite radio  telecommunications backhaul and trunking  weather and environment monitoring and air traffic control 
in addition  ss l has applied its design and manufacturing expertise to produce spacecraft subsystems  such as batteries for the international space station  and to integrate government and other add on missions on commercial satellites  which are referred to as hosted payloads 
as of december   ss l had billion in backlog for satellites for customers including  among others  intelsat global sa  ses sa  telesat holdings inc  hispasat  sa  echostar corporation  sirius xm satellite radio  terrestar networks  inc  asia satellite telecommunications co 
ltd  hughes network systems  llc  viasat  inc  eutelsat ictqatar  directv  sing tel optus  sat lites mexicanos  sa de cv  asia broadcast satellite and telenor satellite broadcasting 
from january  to february   ss l was awarded contracts for three satellites  including two satellites for nbn co 
limited 
satellite demand is driven by fleet replacement cycles  increased video  internet and data bandwidth demand and new satellite applications 
ss l expects its future success to derive from maintaining and expanding its share of the satellite construction contracts of its existing customers based on its engineering  technical and manufacturing leadership  its value proposition and record of reliability  the increased demand for new applications requiring high power and capacity satellites such as hdtv  d tv and broadband  and ss l s expansion of governmental contracts based on its record of reliability and experience with fixed price contract manufacturing 
we also expect ss l to benefit from the increased revenues from larger and more complex satellites 
the costs of satellite manufacturing include costs for material  subcontracts  direct labor and manufacturing overhead 
due to the long lead times required for certain of our purchased parts  and the desire to obtain volume related price concessions  ss l has entered into various purchase commitments with suppliers in advance of receipt of a satellite order 
ss l s costs for material and subcontracts have been relatively stable and are generally provided by suppliers with which ss l has a long established history 
the number of available suppliers and the cost of qualifying the component for use in a space environment to ss l s unique requirements limit the flexibility and advantages inherent in multiple sourcing options 
satellite manufacturers have high fixed costs relating primarily to labor and overhead 
based on its current cost structure  we estimate that ss l covers its fixed costs  including depreciation and amortization  with an average of four to five satellite awards a year depending on the size  power  pricing and complexity of the satellite 
cash flow in the satellite manufacturing business tends to be uneven 
it takes two to three years to complete a satellite project and numerous assumptions are built into the estimated costs 
ss l s cash receipts are tied to the achievement of contract milestones that depend in part on the ability of its subcontractors to deliver on time 
in addition  the timing of satellite awards is difficult to predict  contributing to the unevenness of revenue and making it more challenging to align the workforce to the workflow 

table of contents while its requirement for ongoing capital investment to maintain its current capacity is relatively low  ss l expects to spend approximately million over the three year period ending december   including million of expenditures in  related to an infrastructure campaign that includes the building of a second thermal vacuum chamber  completing certain building and systems modifications and purchasing additional test and satellite handling equipment to meet its contractual obligations more efficiently 
upon completion of this infrastructure campaign  we anticipate returning to a more customary level of annual capital expenditures of million to million  excluding major system upgrades caused by additional expansion or technology insertion 
the satellite manufacturing industry is a knowledge intensive business  the success of which relies heavily on its technological heritage and the skills of its workforce 
the breadth and depth of talent and experience resident in ss l s workforce of approximately  personnel is one of our key competitive resources 
satellites are extraordinarily complex devices designed to operate in the very hostile environment of space 
this complexity may lead to unanticipated costs during the design  manufacture and testing of a satellite 
ss l establishes provisions for costs based on historical experience and program complexity to cover anticipated costs 
as most of ss l s contracts are fixed price  cost increases in excess of these provisions reduce profitability and may result in losses to ss l  which may be material 
because the satellite manufacturing industry is highly competitive  buyers have the advantage over suppliers in negotiating prices  and terms and conditions resulting in reduced margins and increased assumptions of risk by manufacturers such as ss l 
satellite services loral holds a economic interest and a voting interest in telesat  the world s fourth largest satellite operator with approximately billion of backlog as of december  telesat is a leading global fixed satellite services operator  with offices and facilities around the world 
telesat provides its satellite and communication services from a fleet of satellites that occupy canadian and other orbital locations 
the satellite services business is capital intensive and the build out of a satellite fleet requires substantial time and investment 
once the investment in a satellite is made  the incremental costs to maintain and operate the satellite is relatively low over the life of the satellite with the exception of in orbit insurance 
telesat has been able to generate a large contracted revenue backlog by entering into long term contracts with some of its customers for all or substantially all of a satellite s life 
historically  this has resulted in revenue from the satellite services business being fairly predictable 
at december   telesat provided satellite services to customers from its fleet of in orbit satellites 
in addition  telesat owns the canadian ka band payload on the viasat satellite which was launched in october telesat currently has two satellites under construction nimiq  which telesat anticipates will be launched in the first half of  and anik g  which telesat anticipates will be launched in the second half of telesat s commitment to providing strong customer service and its focus on innovation and technical expertise has allowed it to successfully build its business to date 
building on its existing contractual revenue backlog  telesat s focus is on taking disciplined steps to grow its core business and sell newly launched and existing in orbit satellite services  and  in a disciplined manner  use the cash flow generated by existing business  contracted expansion satellites and cost savings to strengthen the business 
telesat believes its satellites offer a strong combination of existing revenue backlog  revenue growth and a strong foundation upon which it will seek to continue to grow its revenue and cash flows 
the growth is expected to come from the canadian payload on the viasat satellite  its nimiq satellite  its anik g satellite  and the sale of available capacity on its existing in orbit satellites 
telesat believes that it is well positioned to serve its customers and the markets in which it participates 
telesat actively pursues opportunities to develop new satellites  particularly in conjunction with current or prospective customers  who will commit to long term service agreements prior to the time the satellite construction contract is signed 
although telesat regularly pursues opportunities to develop new satellites  it does not procure additional or replacement satellites until it believes there is a demonstrated need and a sound business plan for such satellite capacity 

table of contents telesat anticipates that it can increase revenue without a proportional increase in operating expenses  allowing for operating margin expansion 
the satellite services business is capital intensive and the build out of a satellite fleet requires substantial time and investment 
once the investment in a satellite is made  the incremental cost to maintain and operate the satellite is relatively low over the life of the satellite  with the exception of in orbit insurance 
the relatively fixed cost nature of the business  combined with contracted revenue growth and other growth opportunities  is expected to produce growth in income and operating cash flow 
in  telesat will remain focused on increasing utilization on its existing satellites  continuing construction of the satellites it is currently procuring  securing additional customer requirements to support the procurement of additional satellites and maintaining cost and operating discipline 
on april   telesat acquired from loral the canadian payload on the viasat satellite and a year revenue contract with xplornet communications inc to make use of the payload 
the viasat satellite was successfully launched in october and entered into commercial service in december telesat determined that following the launch in may of the telstar r estrela do sul satellite  the satellite s north solar array failed to fully deploy 
the north solar array anomaly has diminished the amount of power available for the satellite s transponders and has reduced the life expectancy of the satellite 
however  the satellite will support all of the existing services to customers formerly provided by telstar estrela do sul  the satellite it replaced at west longitude  as well as provide some additional capacity for expansion 
telesat has insurance policies that provide coverage for a total  constructive total or partial loss of telstar r estrela do sul during the third quarter of  telesat filed a claim under its policies with its insurers 
in december  telesat received insurance proceeds in the amount of million 
the proceeds will be reinvested in satellite procurements in accordance with the terms and conditions of the credit agreement 
telesat s operating results are subject to fluctuations as a result of exchange rate variations 
approximately of telesat s revenues received in canada for the year ended december   a large portion of its expenses and a substantial portion of its indebtedness and capital expenditures were denominated in us dollars 
the most significant impact of variations in the exchange rate is on the us dollar denominated debt financing 
a five percent change in the value of the canadian dollar against the us dollar at december  would have increased or decreased telesat s net income for the year ended december  by approximately million 
during the period from october  to december   telesat s us term loan facility  senior notes and senior subordinated notes have increased by approximately million due to the stronger us dollar 
during that same time period  however  the liability created by the fair value of the currency basis swap  which synthetically converts billion of the us term loan facility debt into cad billion of debt  decreased by approximately million 
strategic developments telesat s board of directors and shareholders have authorized management to explore a refinancing recapitalization transaction  which  if consummated  could result in  among other things  the incurrence by telesat of up to approximately cad million of additional debt and payments to telesat s option holders and distributions to telesat s shareholders of up to approximately cad million  of which up to approximately cad million would be paid to loral 
among the factors that may affect the determination whether to proceed with this potential transaction are market conditions for refinancing and incurrence of additional indebtedness 
if any transaction results in receipt of proceeds by loral  loral would evaluate all alternatives for the use of such proceeds  including stock repurchases and or a dividend to loral stockholders 
with regard to ss l  loral has been exploring various strategic initiatives relating to the separation of its satellite manufacturing subsidiary from loral  including a potential spin off as well as other strategic alternatives 
in connection with a potential spin off  the loral board of directors previously formed a committee of independent directors to negotiate and approve the terms and conditions of the stock that would be distributed in respect of the company s non voting common stock pursuant to a spin off of ss l and to evaluate alternatives with respect thereto 
the company is considering alternatives to a spin off for the separation of ss l from loral and  as a result  the company has asked the committee to defer further work on its assignment 
there can be no assurance whether or when any transaction involving loral  telesat or ss l will occur 

table of contents general we regularly explore and evaluate possible other strategic transactions and alliances 
we also periodically engage in discussions with satellite service providers  satellite manufacturers and others regarding such matters  which may include joint ventures and strategic relationships as well as business combinations or the acquisition or disposition of assets 
in order to pursue certain of these opportunities  we will require additional funds 
there can be no assurance that we will enter into additional strategic transactions or alliances  nor do we know if we will be able to obtain the necessary financing for these transactions on favorable terms  if at all 
in  loral agreed to purchase the canadian coverage portion of the viasat satellite  which was successfully launched in october the viasat satellite is a high capacity ka band spot beam satellite for broadband services that was launched into the o west longitude orbital location 
loral also entered into an agreement with xplornet  canada s largest rural broadband provider  to deliver high throughput satellite ka band capacity for broadband services in canada 
under the agreement  xplornet agreed to contract with loral for the canadian capacity on the viasat satellite and associated gateway services for the expected life of the satellite  now projected to commence in late or early  and loral agreed to construct and operate four gateways in canada 
approximately million had been invested by loral through april  a portion of these costs was funded by prepayments in from xplornet of cad million as required under the agreement 
on april   loral assigned its investment in the canadian broadband business  including the canadian coverage portion of the viasat satellite  to telesat for million plus reimbursement of approximately million  representing loral s net costs incurred through the closing date see note to the financial statements 
in addition  in connection with the assignment  telesat agreed that if it obtains certain supplemental capacity on the payload  loral will be entitled to receive  for four years  one half of any net revenue actually earned by telesat on such supplemental capacity 
in connection with the acquisition of our ownership interest in telesat in  loral has agreed that  subject to certain exceptions described in telesat s shareholders agreement  for so long as loral has an interest in telesat  it will not compete in the business of leasing  selling or otherwise furnishing fixed satellite service  broadcast satellite service or audio and video broadcast direct to home service using transponder capacity in the c band  ku band and ka band including in each case extended band frequencies and the business of providing end to end data solutions on networks comprised of earth terminals  space segment  and  where appropriate  networking hubs 
consolidated operating results please refer to critical accounting matters set forth below in this section 
the following discussion of revenues and adjusted ebitda see note to the financial statements reflects the results of our business segments for  and the balance of the discussion relates to our consolidated results unless otherwise noted 
the common definition of ebitda is earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
in evaluating financial performance  we use revenues and operating income before depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation excluding stock based compensation from ss l phantom stock appreciation rights expected to be settled in cash  gain on disposition of net assets and directors indemnification expense adjusted ebitda as the measure of a segment s profit or loss 
adjusted ebitda is equivalent to the common definition of ebitda before gain on disposition of net assets  directors indemnification expense  gains or losses on litigation not related to our operations  other expense  and equity in net income of affiliates 
adjusted ebitda allows us and investors to compare our operating results with that of competitors exclusive of depreciation and amortization  interest and investment income  interest expense  gain on disposition of net assets  directors indemnification expense  gains or losses on litigation not related to our operations  other expense and equity in net income of affiliates 
financial results of competitors in our industry have significant variations that can result from timing of capital expenditures  the amount of intangible assets recorded  the differences in assets lives  the timing and amount of investments  the effects of other expense  which are typically for non recurring transactions not related to the on going business  and effects of investments not directly managed 
the use of adjusted ebitda allows us and investors to compare operating results exclusive of these items 
competitors in our industry have significantly different capital structures 
the use of adjusted ebitda maintains comparability of performance by excluding interest expense 

table of contents we believe the use of adjusted ebitda along with us gaap financial measures enhances the understanding of our operating results and is useful to us and investors in comparing performance with competitors  estimating enterprise value and making investment decisions 
adjusted ebitda as used here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by competitors 
we also use adjusted ebitda to evaluate operating performance of our segments  to allocate resources and capital to such segments  to measure performance for incentive compensation programs and to evaluate future growth opportunities 
adjusted ebitda should be used in conjunction with us gaap financial measures and is not presented as an alternative to cash flow from operations as a measure of our liquidity or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating performance 
loral has two segments satellite manufacturing and satellite services 
our segment reporting data includes unconsolidated affiliates that meet the reportable segment criteria 
the satellite services segment includes of the results reported by telesat for the years ended december   and although we analyze telesat s revenue and expenses under the satellite services segment  we eliminate its results in our consolidated financial statements  where we report our share of telesat s results under the equity method of accounting

table of contents gain on disposition of long lived assets in results from the transfer of telesat s leasehold interests in the telstar satellite and related contracts to apt satellite for a total consideration of approximately million 
telesat s operating results are subject to fluctuations as a result of exchange rate variations to the extent that transactions are made in currencies other than canadian dollars 
telesat s main currency exposures as of december   lie in its us dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable and debt financing 
the most significant impact of variations in the exchange rate is on the us dollar denominated debt financing 
we estimated that  after considering the impact of hedges  a five percent change in the value of the canadian dollar against the us dollar at december  would have increased or decreased telesat s net income for the year by approximately million 
during the period from october  to december   the carrying value of telesat s us term loan facility  senior notes and senior subordinated notes has increased by approximately million due to the stronger us dollar 
during that same time period  however  the liability created by the fair value of the currency basis swap  which synthetically converts billion of the us term loan facility debt into cad billion of debt  decreased by approximately million 
the equity losses in xtar  llc xtar  our owned joint venture  represent our share of xtar losses incurred in connection with its operations 
we regularly evaluate our investment in xtar to determine whether there has been a decline in fair value that is other than temporary 
during november and january  xtar reduced its revenue forecast for and subsequent years 
we have performed an impairment test for our investment in xtar as of december   using the january forecast  and concluded that our investment in xtar was not impaired 
any further declines in xtar s projected revenues may result in a future impairment charge 
backlog backlog as of december  and was as follows in millions september  september  satellite manufacturing satellite services total backlog before eliminations satellite manufacturing eliminations satellite services eliminations total backlog it is expected that approximately of satellite manufacturing backlog as of december  will be recognized as revenue during it is expected that approximately of satellite services backlog will be recognized as revenue during as of december   telesat had received approximately million of customer prepayments  none of which is related to satellites under construction 
critical accounting matters the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of revenues and expenses reported for the period 
actual results could differ from estimates 
revenue recognition most of our satellite manufacturing revenue is associated with long term fixed price contracts 
revenue and profit from satellite sales under these long term contracts are recognized using the cost to cost percentage of completion method  which requires significant estimates 
we use this method because reasonably dependable estimates can be made based on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates include forecasts of costs and schedules  estimating contract revenue related to contract performance including estimated amounts for penalties and performance incentives that will be received as the satellite performs on orbit and the potential for component obsolescence in connection with long term procurements 
estimated amounts for performance incentives and penalties are included in contract value when and to the extent that it is probable such amounts will be paid or received 
performance incentives and penalties relate primarily to on orbit performance of the satellite and early or late delivery of the satellite  although a limited number of contracts include performance incentives and penalties related to mass  payload performance and other items 

table of contents satellite construction contracts often include provisions for performance incentives pursuant to which a portion of the contract value typically about is at risk  over the life of the satellite typically years  contingent upon the in orbit performance of the satellite in accordance with contractual specifications 
these performance incentives are structured in two forms i under warranty payback  the customer pays the entire amount of the performance incentives during the period of satellite construction and such performance incentive amounts are subject to warranty claims  or ii under orbital receivables  the customer makes payments of performance incentives at regular intervals often monthly over the in orbit life of the satellite 
performance incentives  whether warranty payback or orbital receivables  are included in revenues during the construction period of the satellite 
the amount of performance incentives recorded as revenues is net of i a factor based on past experience to reflect the risk that a portion of the performance incentives will be lost due to non performance and ii in the case of orbital receivables  a discount for the time value of money because the amounts will be collected over the operating life of the satellite 
estimates for performance incentives and penalties are assessed continually during the term of the contract and revisions are reflected when the conditions become known 
changes in estimates are typically the result of schedule changes that affect performance incentives and penalties  changes in contract scope  changes in new business forecasts that can affect the level of overhead allocated to a given contract and changes in estimates on contracts as a result of the complex nature of the satellites we manufacture 
changes in estimates are included in sales and cost of sales using the cumulative catch up method  which recognizes the cumulative effect of changes in estimates on current and prior periods in the current period based on a contract s completion percentage 
provisions for losses on contracts are recorded when estimates determine that a loss will be incurred on a contract at completion 
under firm fixed price contracts  work performed and products shipped are paid for at a fixed price without adjustment for actual costs incurred in connection with the contract  accordingly  favorable changes in estimates in a period will result in additional revenue and profit  and unfavorable changes in estimates will result in a reduction of revenue and profit or the recording of a loss that will be borne solely by us 
for the years ended december   and  cumulative catch up adjustments related to prior year activity as a result of changes in contract estimates increased operating income by million  million and million  respectively  and diluted earnings per share by  and  respectively 
billed receivables and long term receivables we are required to estimate the collectability of our long term receivables and billed receivables which are included in contracts in process on our consolidated balance sheet 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the collectability of these receivables  including the current creditworthiness of each customer and related aging of the past due balances 
charges for bad debts recorded to the statements of operations on billed receivables for the years ended december   and  were nil  nil and million  respectively 
at december   and  billed receivables were net of allowances for doubtful accounts of million  million and million  respectively 
we evaluate specific accounts when we become aware of a situation where a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to a deterioration of its financial condition  credit ratings or bankruptcy 
the reserve requirements are based on the best facts available to us and are re evaluated periodically 
performance incentives  whether warranty payback or orbital receivables  are recorded as receivables on our balance sheet as we record the revenues on the satellite during the construction period  which is typically two to three years 
performance incentives structured as warranty payback are included in contracts in process  and orbital receivables  which are collected over the in orbit life of the satellite  are included in long term receivables 
inventories inventories are reviewed for estimated obsolescence or unusable items and  if appropriate  are written down to the net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those we project  additional inventory write downs may be required 
these are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of the inventory 
charges for inventory obsolescence included in the consolidated statements of operations were nil  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 

table of contents fair value measurements us gaap defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants 
us gaap also establishes a fair value hierarchy that gives the highest priority to observable inputs and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below level inputs represent a fair value that is derived from unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets at the measurement date 
level inputs represent a fair value that is derived from quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  model based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities  and pricing inputs  other than quoted prices in active markets included in level  which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date 
level inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
the fair values are therefore determined using model based techniques that include option pricing models  discounted cash flow models  and similar techniques 
these provisions are applicable to all of our assets and liabilities that are measured and recorded at fair value 
assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis the following table presents our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at december  september  september  september  level level level in thousands assets cash equivalents money market funds available for sale securities communications industry derivatives foreign exchange contracts non qualified pension plan assets liabilities derivatives foreign exchange contracts the company does not have any non financial assets or non financial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis as of december  assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non recurring basis we review the carrying values of our equity method investments when events and circumstances warrant and consider all available evidence in evaluating when declines in fair value are other than temporary 
the fair values of our investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available  and may include quoted market prices  market comparables and discounted cash flow projections 
an impairment charge would be recorded when the carrying amount of the investment exceeds its current fair value and is determined to be other than temporary 

table of contents taxation loral is subject to us federal  state and local income taxation on its worldwide income and foreign taxes on certain income from sources outside the united states 
our foreign subsidiaries are subject to taxation in local jurisdictions 
telesat is subject to tax in canada and other jurisdictions and loral will provide in operating earnings any additional us current and deferred tax required on distributions received or deemed to be received from telesat 
we use the liability method in accounting for taxes whereby income taxes are recognized during the year in which transactions are recorded in the financial statements 
deferred taxes reflect the future tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting and are measured by applying anticipated statutory tax rates in effect for the year during which the differences are expected to reverse 
we assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and  based upon this analysis  record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets to the extent recoverability does not satisfy the more likely than not recognition criteria 
the tax effects of an uncertain tax position utp taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns are recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on its technical merits as of the reporting date 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to utps in income tax expense on a quarterly basis 
we recognize the benefit of a utp in the period when it is effectively settled 
previously recognized tax positions are derecognized in the first period in which it is no longer more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained upon examination 
evaluating the technical merits of a tax position and determining the benefit to be recognized involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying such evaluation 
pension and other employee benefits we maintain qualified pension and supplemental retirement plans 
these plans are defined benefit pension plans 
in addition to providing pension benefits  we provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees and dependents 
these pension and other employee benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
material changes in these pension and other employee postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions  as well as our actual experience 
the discount rate is subject to change each year  based on a hypothetical yield curve developed from a portfolio of high quality  corporate  non callable bonds with maturities that match our projected benefit payment stream 
the resulting discount rate reflects the matching of the plan liability cash flows to the yield curve 
changes in applicable high quality long term corporate bond indices are also considered 
the discount rate determined on this basis was as of december   a decrease of basis points from december  the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets is selected by taking into account the expected duration of the plan s projected benefit obligation  asset mix and the fact that its assets are actively managed to mitigate risk 
allowable investment types include equity investments and fixed income investments 
both investment types may include alternative investments which are permitted to be up to of total plan assets 
pension plan assets are primarily managed by russell investment corp 
russell  which allocates the assets into specified russell designed funds as we direct 
each specified russell fund is then managed by investment managers chosen by russell 
we also engage non russell related investment managers through russell  in its role as trustee  to invest pension plan assets 
the targeted long term allocation of our pension plan assets is in equity investments and in fixed income investments 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets determined on this basis was for  and for  we are continuing to use an expected long term rate of return of 
these pension and other employee postretirement benefit costs are expected to increase to approximately million in from million in  primarily due to the lower discount rate 
lowering the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return each by would have increased these pension and other employee postretirement benefits costs by approximately million and million  respectively  in 
table of contents the benefit obligations for pensions and other employee benefits exceeded the fair value of plan assets by million at december  we are required to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan on our balance sheet 
market conditions and interest rates significantly affect future assets and liabilities of loral s pension and other employee benefits plans 
stock based compensation stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
in addition  share based payment transactions with nonemployees are measured at the fair value of the equity instrument issued 
we use the black scholes merton option pricing model and other models as applicable to estimate the fair value of these stock based awards 
these models require us to make significant judgments regarding the assumptions used within the models  the most significant of which are the stock price volatility assumption  the expected life of the option award  the risk free rate of return and dividends during the expected term 
changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on the amount of stock based compensation we recognize 
the company estimates expected forfeitures of stock based awards at the grant date and recognizes compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest 
the forfeiture assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate 
therefore  changes in the forfeiture assumptions may impact the timing of the total amount of expense recognized over the vesting period 
estimated forfeitures are reassessed in each reporting period and may change based on new facts and circumstances 
we emerged from bankruptcy on november   and as a result  we did not have sufficient stock price history upon which to base our volatility assumption for measuring our stock based awards 
in determining the volatility used in our models  we considered the volatility of the stock prices of selected companies in the satellite industry  the nature of those companies  our emergence from bankruptcy and other factors 
we based our estimate of the average life of a stock based award using the midpoint between the vesting and expiration dates 
our risk free rate of return assumption for awards was based on term matching  nominal  monthly us treasury constant maturity rates as of the date of grant 
we assumed no dividends during the expected term 
the ss l phantom stock appreciation rights program has been designed to incentivize and reward our employees based on the increase in a synthetically determined value of ss l s equity 
as ss l s common stock has not historically been publicly traded and thus does not have a readily ascertainable market value  its equity value under the program is derived from a formula that calculates equity value based on a multiple of adjusted ebitda plus cash on hand less debt at the end of the relevant year 
each phantom stock appreciation right provides the recipient with the right to receive an amount equal to the increase in our notional stock price over the base price at the date of grant multiplied by the number of phantom stock appreciation rights vested on the applicable vesting date 
the baseline price at each grant date is updated accordingly 
the phantom stock appreciation rights have fixed exercise dates 
as such  the phantom stock appreciation rights are automatically exercised and the value if any is paid out on each vesting date 
the phantom stock appreciation rights may be settled in loral stock or cash at our option 
the number of shares of loral stock to be issued on the vesting date is determined by dividing the value of the phantom stock appreciation rights by the price per share of loral stock on the vesting date 
accordingly  the phantom stock appreciation rights are accounted for as liability awards and the value of the awards is adjusted quarterly for changes in the value of the award resulting from increases or decreases in actual or forecasted adjusted ebitda for the relevant year 
compensation expense is recognized ratably over the requisite vesting period 
contingencies contingencies by their nature relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss  if any 
we accrue for costs relating to litigation  claims and other contingent matters when  in management s opinion  such liabilities become probable and reasonably estimable 
such estimates may be based on advice from third parties or on management s judgment  as appropriate 
actual amounts paid may differ from amounts estimated  and such differences will be charged to operations in the period in which the final determination of the liability is made 
management considers the assessment of loss contingencies as a critical accounting policy because of the significant uncertainty relating to the outcome of any potential legal actions and other claims and the difficulty of predicting the likelihood and range of the potential liability involved  coupled with the material impact on our results of operations that could result from legal actions or other claims and assessments 

table of contents accounting standards issued and not yet implemented for discussion of accounting standards issued and not yet implemented that could have an impact on us  see note to the financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources loral as described above  the company s principal assets are of the capital stock of ss l and a economic interest in telesat 
in addition  the company has a economic interest in xtar 
ss l s operations are consolidated in the company s financial statements  while the operations of telesat and xtar are not consolidated but are presented using the equity method of accounting 
the parent company has no debt 
ss l amended and restated its revolving credit facility on december   increasing the facility amount to million  extending the maturity to january  and removing the parent company guarantee 
at december   there were no outstanding borrowings under the ss l credit agreement and million of letters of credit outstanding 
telesat has third party debt with financial institutions 
the parent company has not provided a guarantee for the debt of telesat 
xtar has no external debt other than to its llc member  hisdesat  for restructured lease payments on the spainsat satellite 
xtar makes payments of million per year to pay down the outstanding restructured lease balance 
a convertible note to hisdesat was paid off on november  through capital contributions from the partners 
loral s capital contribution to xtar was million 
cash is maintained at the parent company  ss l  telesat and xtar to support the operating needs of each respective entity 
the ability of ss l and telesat to pay dividends and management fees in cash to the parent company is governed by applicable covenants relating to the debt at each of those entities and  in the case of telesat and xtar  by their respective shareholder agreements 
the parent company s cash flow is fairly predictable 
ss l s cash flow  however  is subject to substantial timing fluctuation of receipts and expenditures and is difficult to forecast on a quarter to quarter basis 
a typical satellite production contract takes two to three years to complete 
ss l s cash receipts are tied to the achievement of contract milestones which are negotiated for each contract  and the timing of milestone receipts does not necessarily match the timing of cash expenditures 
revenues and profits under these long term contracts are recognized using the cost to cost percentage of completion method  so the timing of revenue recognition and cash receipts do not match  creating fluctuations in certain balance sheet accounts including contracts in process  long term receivables and customer advances 
in addition  the timing of satellite awards is difficult to predict  contributing to the unevenness of revenues and cash flow 
cash and available credit at december   the company had million of cash and cash equivalents  million of restricted cash and no debt 
the company s cash and cash equivalents increased by million from december   while restricted cash increased by million 
ss l entered into a satellite manufacturing contract during the first quarter of that requires certain customer payments to be placed into escrow until the satellite is delivered 
the escrow amount of million at december  for this contract will grow by an additional million in the escrow funds with interest earned will be released to ss l upon delivery of the satellite in during  ss l did not borrow any funds under its revolving credit agreement 
the cash increase during consisted of million provided by operating activities  partially offset by million used in financing activities and million used in investing activities 
a more detailed discussion of these cash changes by activity is set forth in the sections  net cash provided by operating activities  net cash used in investing activities  and net cash used in provided by financing activities 
changes in cash at the parent company and ss l during are discussed below 

table of contents as discussed above  the ss l credit agreement was amended and restated on december  to increase the facility from million to million  extend the maturity to january  and eliminate the parent company guarantee 
on december   the ss l credit agreement was amended  increasing the million letter of credit sub limit to million 
as of december   ss l had borrowing availability of approximately million under the facility after giving effect to approximately million of outstanding letters of credit 
ss l anticipates that over the next months it will be in compliance with all the covenants of the ss l credit agreement and have full availability of the facility 
the amended and restated ss l credit agreement allows for a spin off of ss l from loral or an initial public offering of ss l 
cash management we have a cash management investment program that seeks a competitive return while maintaining a conservative risk profile 
our cash management investment policy establishes what we believe to be conservative guidelines relating to the investment of surplus cash 
the policy allows us to invest in commercial paper  money market funds and other similar short term investments but does not permit us to engage in speculative or leveraged transactions  nor does it permit us to hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
the cash management investment policy was designed to preserve capital and safeguard principal  to meet all of our liquidity requirements and to provide a competitive rate of return for similar risk categories of investment 
the policy addresses dealer qualifications  lists approved securities  establishes minimum acceptable credit ratings  sets concentration limits  defines a maturity structure  requires all firms to safe keep securities on our behalf  requires certain mandatory reporting activity and discusses review of the portfolio 
we operate the cash management investment program under the guidelines of our investment policy and continuously monitor the investments to avoid risks 
we currently invest our cash in several liquid prime aaa money market funds 
the dispersion across funds reduces the exposure of a default at one fund 
orbital receivables as of december   ss l had orbital receivables of approximately million  net of fresh start fair value adjustments of million 
of the gross orbital receivables as of december   approximately million are related to satellites launched and million are related to satellites that are under construction 
this represents an increase in gross orbital receivables of approximately million from december  during  our orbital receivables decreased by approximately million related to the telstar r estrela do sul anomaly and increased by approximately million related to the sale of our canadian broadband business to telesat 
the growth in the orbital receivable balance as a percentage of sales in was less than in because more contracts in process during included performance incentives structured as warranty payback rather than orbital receivables 
we anticipate that this orbital receivable asset will continue to grow  deferring the receipt of cash 
we will generate positive cash flow from orbital receivables once principal and interest payments received for the in orbit satellites become greater than the amount being deferred for satellites under construction 
during  ss l received million of orbital receivable payments  representing principal and interest 
the timing of when we will have positive cash flow from orbital receivables is dependent on a number of factors including the number of new satellite awards with the requirement for orbital incentive payments  the timing of the completion of contracts under construction  interest rates associated with orbital incentive payments  the performance of on orbit satellites and the number of satellites in operation as compared to the number of satellites under construction 
liquidity the million increase in cash and cash equivalents for the company from december  to december  consisted of a million increase for the parent company and a million decrease for ss l 
the million increase in restricted cash was the result of a million increase at ss l for two contract receipts required to go into escrow as discussed above  partially offset by a million reduction in restricted cash for the parent company and a million reduction in other restricted cash for ss l 

table of contents during  the parent company s unrestricted cash position increased approximately million to million 
in january  as permitted by the ss l revolving credit facility  the parent company received a million dividend from ss l and paid ss l million in settlement of net intercompany account balances 
on march   loral entered into agreements to sell its investment in the canadian broadband business  including the canadian coverage portion of the viasat satellite  to telesat for million plus reimbursement of approximately million  representing loral s net costs incurred through the closing date 
this transaction closed on april  with the parent company receiving the cash proceeds 
in addition  in connection with this transaction  telesat agreed that  if it obtains certain supplemental capacity on the payload  loral will be entitled to receive  for four years  one half of any net revenue actually earned by telesat on such supplemental capacity 
the parent company also received approximately million in cash from the settlement of directors and officers liability insurance claims and received two quarterly management fee payments from telesat totaling million 
partially offsetting these cash receipts  the parent company used million to fund operating expenses and changes in working capital  paid million to fund withholding taxes on employee cashless stock option exercises  made a million capital contribution to xtar and made approximately million in tax payments 
in addition  on november   we announced a stock repurchase program under which the company may repurchase up to  shares 
as of december   the company repurchased  shares for cash of million 
at december   ss l owed the parent company approximately million that was reimbursed by ss l in january at the parent company  we expect that our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund projected expenditures for the next months  including the stock repurchase program 
in addition to our cash on hand  we believe that  given the substantial value of our assets  which include our economic interest in telesat and our equity interest in xtar  we have the ability  if appropriate  to access the financial markets for debt or equity at the parent company 
given the continuously changing financial environment  however  there can be no assurance that the parent company would be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms 
during  ss l generated cash of million before payment of a million dividend to the parent company and a million increase in restricted cash  resulting in an unrestricted cash position of million as of december  the primary source for this increase in cash was adjusted ebitda of million which was partially offset by an increase in net program assets contracts in process  long term receivables and customer advances of million  million of capital expenditures  a million decrease in pension and postretirement liabilities and a million increase in inventories 
in addition  other changes in balance sheet accounts used cash of approximately million 
ss l s restricted cash balance at december  was million 
ss l s projected use of cash for the next months includes capital expenditures and continued growth in its orbital receivables balance 
with regard to capital expenditures  ss l expects to spend approximately million over the three year period ending december   including million of expenditures in  related to an infrastructure campaign that includes the building of a second thermal vacuum chamber  completing certain building and systems modifications and purchasing additional test and satellite handling equipment to meet its contractual obligations more efficiently 
upon completion of this infrastructure campaign  ss l anticipates returning to a more customary level of annual capital expenditures of million to million  excluding major system upgrades caused by additional expansion or technology insertion 
the orbital receivable asset will continue to grow in we anticipate that an additional million of cash received in will be added to the restricted escrow account as required by the contract that was signed in the first quarter of in addition  in relation to a new contract award entered into in that required a million performance bond representing approximately of the contract value  ss l has deposited million in an escrow account with the surety supplying the bond 
the uncertainty as to the timing and nature of new construction contract awards  milestone receipts and cash flow related to contract assets can change our cash requirements 
ss l believes that  absent unforeseen circumstances  with its cash on hand and cash flow from operations  it has sufficient liquidity to fulfill its obligations for the next months 
the borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility also enhances ss l s liquidity position 

table of contents risks to cash flow economic and credit market conditions could adversely affect the ability of customers to make payments to us  including orbital receivable payments under satellite construction contracts with ss l 
though most of our customers are substantial corporations for which creditworthiness is generally high  there are certain customers which are either highly leveraged or are in the developmental stage and are not fully funded 
there can be no assurance that these customers will not delay contract payments to  or seek financial relief from  us if such customers have financial difficulties 
if customers fall behind or default on their payment obligations  our liquidity will be adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that ss l s customers will not default on their obligations to ss l in the future and that such defaults will not materially and adversely affect ss l and loral 
in the event of an uncured payment default by a customer during the pre launch construction phase of the satellite  ss l s construction contracts generally provide ss l with significant rights even if its customers or their successors have paid significant amounts under the contract 
these rights typically include the right to stop work on the satellite and the right to terminate the contract for default 
in the latter case  ss l would generally have the right to retain  and sell to other customers  the satellite or satellite components that are under construction 
the exercise of such rights  however  could be impeded by the assertion by customers of defenses and counterclaims  including claims of breach of performance obligations on the part of ss l  and our recovery could be reduced by the lack of a ready resale market for the affected satellites or their components 
in either case  our liquidity could be adversely affected pending resolution of such customer disputes 
in the event of an uncured payment default by a customer after satellite delivery and launch when title has passed to the customer  ss l s remedies are more limited 
typically  amounts due post launch and delivery are final milestone payments and  in certain cases  orbital incentive payments 
to recover such amounts  ss l generally would have to commence litigation to enforce its rights 
we believe  however  that  as customers generally rely on ss l to provide orbital anomaly and troubleshooting support for the life of the satellite  which support is generally perceived to be critical to maximize the life and performance of the satellite  it is likely that customers or their successors will cure any payment defaults and fulfill their payment obligations or make other satisfactory arrangements to obtain ss l s support  and our liquidity would not be adversely affected 
ss l s contracts contain detailed and complex technical specifications to which the satellite must be built 
ss l s contracts also impose a variety of other contractual obligations on ss l  including the requirement to deliver the satellite by an agreed upon date  subject to negotiated allowances 
if ss l is unable to meet its contract obligations  including significant deviations from technical specifications or delivering the satellite beyond the agreed upon date in a contract  the customer would have the right to terminate the contract for contractor default 
if a contract is terminated for contractor default  ss l would be required to refund the payments made to ss l to the date of termination  which could be significant 
in such circumstances  ss l would  however  keep the satellite under construction and be able to recoup some of its losses through the resale of the satellite or its components to another customer 
it has been ss l s experience that  because the satellite is generally critical to the execution of a customer s operations and business plan  customers will usually accept a satellite with minor deviations from specifications or renegotiate a revised delivery date with ss l as opposed to terminating the contract for contractor default and losing the satellite 
nonetheless  the obligation to return all funds paid to ss l in the later stages of a contract  due to termination for contractor default  would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
ss l currently has a contract in process with an estimated delivery date later than the contractually specified date after which the customer may terminate the contract for default 
the customer is an established operator which will utilize the satellite in the operation of its existing business 
ss l and the customer are continuing to perform their obligations under the contract  and the customer continues to make milestone payments to ss l 
although there can be no assurance  the company believes that the customer will take delivery of this satellite and will not seek to terminate the contract for default 
if the customer should successfully terminate the contract for default  the customer would be entitled to a full refund of its payments  liquidated damages  and interest which through december  totaled approximately million  plus re procurement costs 
in the event of termination for default  ss l would own the satellite and would attempt to recoup any losses through resale to another customer 

table of contents many of ss l s customer contracts include performance incentives  structured as warranty payback or orbital receivables 
if a satellite sold under a contract with performance incentives experiences an anomaly that leads to a degradation in performance as defined in each particular contract  then in the case of warranty payback  ss l would be obligated to return to the customer a portion of the performance incentive payments received and  in the case of orbital receivables  ss l would no longer be entitled to a portion of the future orbital receivable payments owed 
the amount ss l would either need to return to the customer in case of warranty payback  or would no longer be entitled to receive from the customer in the case of orbital receivables  would depend on various factors including  among others  the specific contractual specifications  the satellite performance and life remaining 
our liquidity could be adversely affected by failure to achieve contractual performance incentives 
for example  in may  following the launch of telstar r estrela do sul  the satellite s north solar array failed to fully deploy resulting in a loss of power and reduced mission life 
as a result of the failure  ss l recorded a charge of approximately million for lost orbital incentives that would otherwise have been payable with respect to telstar r estrela do sul on october   terrestar networks inc terrestar  an ss l customer  filed for bankruptcy under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
as of december   ss l had million of past due receivables from terrestar related to an in orbit ss l built satellite and other related ground system deliverables and million of past due receivables from terrestar related to a second satellite under construction 
ss l had previously exercised its contractual right to stop work on the satellite under construction as a result of terrestar s payment default 
the in orbit satellite long term orbital receivable balance  net of fair value adjustment  reflected on the balance sheet at december  is million 
the long term orbital receivable balance reflected on the balance sheet for the satellite under construction is million 
in july  the terrestar bankruptcy court approved an agreement between terrestar and a subsidiary of dish network corporation dish subsidiary pursuant to which dish subsidiary agreed to purchase substantially all of terrestar s assets 
in connection with the sale  pursuant to a stipulation and order entered into between terrestar and ss l and approved by the terrestar bankruptcy court in july  the parties agreed to amend the satellite construction contract for the in orbit satellite  the contract for related ground system deliverables and the contract for the satellite under construction  and terrestar agreed to assume and assign to dish subsidiary  and dish subsidiary will take assignment of  such contracts as amended 
the contract amendments provide for restructuring of certain past due payments and payments to become due as a result of which ss l will maintain the collective profit position of the contracts and will not realize any impairment to its receivables 
in addition  ss l will be entitled to an allowed unsecured claim against terrestar in the amount of approximately million 
the assumption will be effective as of the earlier of the closing of the asset sale to dish subsidiary or the effective date of confirmation of a plan of reorganization for terrestar 
the assignment will be effective as of the closing of the asset sale to dish subsidiary 
on february   the terrestar bankruptcy court entered an order confirming terrestar s plan of reorganization 
the effective date of the plan of reorganization and the closing of the asset sale are each subject to a number of conditions  including  among others  fcc and other regulatory approvals 
pending assumption and assignment of the contracts  terrestar is required to make payments that fall due in the ordinary course of business under the contracts as amended 
assuming closing of the asset sale to dish subsidiary and assumption and assignment of the contracts as amended  ss l believes that it will not incur a loss with respect to the receivables due from terrestar 
as of december   ss l had receivables included in contracts in process from dbsd satellite services gp formerly known as ico satellite services gp and referred to herein as ico  a customer with an ss l built satellite in orbit  in the aggregate amount of approximately million 
in addition  under its contract  ico has future payment obligations to ss l that total approximately million  of which approximately million including million of orbital incentives is included in long term receivables 
after receiving bankruptcy court approval  ico  which sought to reorganize under chapter of the bankruptcy code in may  assumed its contract with ss l  with certain modifications 
the contract modifications do not have a material adverse effect on ss l  and  although the timing of certain payments to be received from ico has changed for example  certain significant payments become due only on or after the effective date of a chapter plan of reorganization for ico  ss l will receive substantially the same net present value from ico as ss l was entitled to receive under the original contract 
in march  the ico bankruptcy court approved an investment agreement pursuant to which dish network corporation dish agreed to acquire ico 
in connection with this investment agreement  in april  dish purchased certain claims against ico for cash  including ss l claims aggregating approximately million plus approximately million of accrued interest 
ss l believes that  based upon completion of the tender offer and other payments by ico to ss l under the modified contract  it is not probable that ss l will incur a material loss with respect to the receivables from ico 
although  in july  the ico bankruptcy court confirmed a plan of reorganization for ico  closing of dish s acquisition of ico and ico s emergence from chapter is still subject to certain other conditions  including  fcc regulatory approval 

table of contents ss l was awarded seven satellite contracts in each of and and was awarded six satellite contracts in each of and ss l had backlog of billion at december  from january  to february   ss l was awarded three satellite contracts 
ss l has high fixed costs relating primarily to labor and overhead 
based on ss l s current cost structure which has been sized to accommodate six to eight satellite contract awards per year  ss l estimates that it covers its fixed costs  including depreciation and amortization  with an average of four to five satellite awards a year depending on the size  power  pricing and complexity of the satellite 
if ss l s satellite awards fall below four to five awards per year  ss l would be required to phase in a reduction of costs to accommodate this lower level of activity 
the timing of any reduced demand for satellites  if it were to occur  is difficult to predict 
it is  therefore  difficult to anticipate the need to reduce costs to match any such slowdown in business  especially when ss l has significant backlog business to perform 
a delay in matching the timing of a reduction in business with a reduction in expenditures could adversely affect our liquidity 
we believe that ss l s current backlog  existing liquidity and availability under ss l s revolving credit facility are sufficient to finance ss l  even if ss l receives fewer than four awards over the next months 
if ss l were to experience a shortage of orders below four awards per year for multiple years  ss l could require additional financing  the amount and timing of which would depend on the magnitude of the order shortfall coupled with the timing of a reduction in costs 
there can be no assurance that ss l could obtain such financing on favorable terms  if at all

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency loral in the normal course of business  we are subject to the risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
to limit this foreign exchange rate exposure  the company seeks to denominate its contracts in us dollars 
if we are unable to enter into a contract in us dollars  we review our foreign exchange exposure and  where appropriate  derivatives are used to minimize the risk of foreign exchange rate fluctuations to operating results and cash flows 
we do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
as of december   ss l had the following amounts denominated in japanese yen and euros which have been translated into us dollars based on the december  exchange rates that were unhedged september  september  foreign currency us in millions future revenues japanese yen future expenditures japanese yen future revenues euros future expenditures euros derivatives in june and july  ss l was awarded satellite contracts denominated in euros and entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts with maturities through and  respectively  to hedge associated foreign currency exchange risk because our costs are denominated principally in us dollars

these foreign exchange contracts mature as follows september  september  september  to sell maturity euro amount at contract rate at market rate in millions as a result of the use of derivative instruments  the company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations 
to mitigate the counterparty credit risk  the company has a policy of entering into contracts only with carefully selected major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors 
there were no derivative instruments in an asset position as of december  therefore  there was no exposure to loss at such date as a result of the potential failure of the counterparties to perform as contracted 
telesat telesat s operating results are subject to fluctuations as a result of exchange rate variations to the extent that transactions are made in currencies other than canadian dollars 
approximately of telesat s revenues for the year ended december   a large portion of its expenses and a substantial portion of its indebtedness and capital expenditures were denominated in us dollars 
the most significant impact of variations in the exchange rate is on the us dollar denominated debt financing 
a five percent change in the value of the canadian dollar against the us dollar at december  would have increased or decreased telesat s net income for the year ended december  by approximately million 
during the period from october  to december   telesat s us term loan facility  senior notes and senior subordinated notes have increased by approximately million due to the stronger us dollar 
during that same time period  however  the liability created by the fair value of the currency basis swap  which synthetically converts billion of the us term loan facility debt into cad billion of debt  decreased by approximately million 
interest the company had no borrowings outstanding under the ss l credit agreement at december  borrowings under this facility are limited to eurodollar loans for periods ending in one  two  three or six months or daily loans for which the interest rate is adjusted daily based upon changes in the prime rate  federal funds rate or one month eurodollar rate 
because of the nature of the borrowing under a revolving credit facility  the borrowing rate adjusts to changes in interest rates over time 
for a million credit facility  if it were fully borrowed  a one percent change in interest rates would effect the company s interest expense by million for the year 
the company had no other long term debt or other exposure to changes in interest rates with respect thereto 
as of december   the company held  shares of globalstar inc common stock and million of non qualified pension plan assets that were mainly invested in equity and bond funds 
during the year  our excess cash was invested in money market securities  we did not hold any other marketable securities
