strategic overview strategic plan alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s strategic plan focuses on their core business of delivering regulated electric and natural gas service in their iowa  wisconsin and minnesota service territories 
the strategic plan is built upon three key elements competitive costs  safe and reliable service  and balanced generation 
competitive costs providing competitive and predictable energy costs for customers is a key element of the strategic plan 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are aware that the majority of their costs become part of rates charged to their customers and any rate increase has an impact on their customers 
given that potential public policy changes and resulting increases in future energy costs are possible  alliant energy  ipl and wpl are focused on controlling their costs with the intent of providing competitive rates to their customers 
energy efficiency is also an important part of the strategic plan and is an option that provides customers with the opportunity to save on their energy bills 
alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s approach to energy efficiency is based on regulations in iowa  wisconsin and minnesota 
the objective in each of these states is to meet prescribed goals in the most cost effective manner 
additional details regarding energy efficiency programs used by alliant energy  ipl and wpl are included in energy efficiency programs below

these services are billed to ipl and wpl at cost based on expenses incurred by corporate services for the benefit of ipl and wpl  respectively 
these costs consisted primarily of employee compensation  benefits and fees associated with various professional services 
in december  the pscw approved a revised service agreement between corporate services  and ipl and wpl 
this revised agreement is subject to additional regulatory approvals prior to being effective 
the revised service agreement is currently expected to be effective in ferc audit as part of routine procedures  in the fourth quarter of  ferc commenced an audit of alliant energy  including its centralized service company corporate services and other affiliated companies

environmental matters overview alliant energy  ipl and wpl are subject to regulation of environmental matters by federal  state and local authorities as a result of their current and past operations 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl monitor these environmental matters and address them with emission abatement programs 
these programs are subject to continuing review and are periodically revised due to various factors  including changes in environmental regulations  litigation of environmental requirements  construction plans and compliance costs 
there is currently significant regulatory uncertainty with respect to the various environmental rules and regulations discussed below 
given the dynamic nature of environmental regulations and other related regulatory requirements  alliant energy  ipl and wpl have established an integrated planning process that is used for environmental compliance for their operations 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl anticipate future expenditures for environmental compliance will be material  including significant capital investments 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl anticipate that prudent expenditures incurred by ipl and wpl to comply with environmental requirements likely would be recovered in rates from their customers 
refer to strategic overview environmental compliance plans for details of alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s environmental compliance plans  including estimated capital expenditures 
the following are major environmental matters that could potentially have a significant impact on alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s financial condition and results of operations 
air quality the clean air act caa and its amendments mandate preservation of air quality through existing regulations and periodic reviews to ensure adequacy of these provisions based on scientific data 
as part of the basic framework under the caa  the epa is required to establish national ambient air quality standards naaqs  which serve to protect public health and welfare 
these standards address six criteria pollutants  four of which nox  so  pm  and ozone are particularly relevant to alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s electric utility operations 
ozone is not directly emitted from alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s generating facilities  however  nox emissions may contribute to its formation in the atmosphere 
fine particulate matter pm may also be formed in the atmosphere from so and nox emissions 
state implementation plans sips document the collection of regulations that individual state agencies will apply to maintain naaqs and related caa requirements 
the epa must approve each sip and if a sip is not acceptable to the epa or if a state chooses not to issue separate state rules  then the epa can assume enforcement of the caa in that state by issuing a federal implementation plan fip 
areas that comply with naaqs are considered to be in attainment  whereas routinely monitored locations that do not comply with these standards may be classified by the epa as non attainment and require further actions to reduce emissions 
additional emissions standards may also be applied under the caa regulatory framework beyond naaqs 
the specific federal and state air quality regulations that may affect alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s operations include cair  csapr formerly known as catr  clean air visibility rule cavr  utility mact rule  wisconsin state mercury rule  wisconsin ract rule  industrial boiler and process heater mact rule and various naaqs rules 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl also monitor various other potential environmental matters related to air quality  including litigation of various federal rules issued under the caa statutory authority  revisions to the new source review psd permitting programs and new source performance standards nsps  and proposed legislation or other regulatory actions to regulate the emission of ghg

cair includes a large regional cap and trade system  where compliance may be achieved by either adding emission controls and or purchasing emission allowances 
in  the dc circuit court remanded cair to the epa for revision to address flaws identified in a opinion issued in response to legal challenges to this rule 
in the interim  cair obligations became effective for nox on jan 
 and so on jan 
 and remain in place until a final cair replacement rule becomes effective 
csapr in july  the epa issued csapr formerly known as catr  which includes requirements to reduce so and nox emissions from fossil fueled egus located in states in the eastern half of the us ipl s and wpl s fossil fueled egus with greater than mw of capacity located in iowa  minnesota and wisconsin would be impacted by csapr requirements 
csapr was expected to replace cair and establish state emission caps for so and nox beginning in phase i 
these so and nox emission caps were expected to be lowered further by csapr in for egus located in iowa and wisconsin  but not egus located in minnesota phase ii 
csapr also includes assurance provisions that would enforce state emission caps 
these provisions require regulated egus with emissions in excess of the state emission caps to 
table of contents surrender additional penalty emission allowances beginning in the provisions required to surrender potential additional emission allowances was expected to limit the amount of emissions trading that would be used to meet compliance requirements 
the emission allowances used for acid rain and cair program compliance cannot be used for compliance with csapr  and csapr emission allowances are not eligible to be used for compliance requirements under acid rain regulations and cair 
refer to note b of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of charges of million recorded in related to ipl s forward contracts to purchase so emission allowances resulting from the impact of csapr 
refer to note of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of a million impairment of intangible assets recognized in related to previously acquired emission allowances resulting from the impact of csapr 
in december  the epa also issued a final supplemental rule that added both iowa and wisconsin to csapr for the ozone season nox emissions trading program 
in february  the epa issued additional revisions to csapr to correct the calculation of emission budgets in certain states  including an increase of the allowed annual so budget and and annual nox budgets for wisconsin 
these revisions would delay the effective date of the assurance provisions of csapr to  rather than the epa is proceeding with final issuance of these revisions in order to implement the changes as part of csapr  if the stay discussed below is removed 
in december  the dc circuit court stayed the implementation of csapr and as a result cair obligations remain effective pending further review by the dc circuit court and the epa 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently unable to predict with certainty the final outcome of the csapr stay and its impact on their financial condition or results of operations 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl currently believe that cair will be replaced in the future  either by csapr  as currently written  or as modified based upon a ruling from the dc circuit court  or another rule that addresses the interstate transport of air pollutants  and expect that capital investments and or modifications to their electric generating facilities to meet the final compliance requirements will be significant 
cavr cavr requires states to develop and implement sips to address visibility impairment in designated national parks and wilderness areas across the country with a national goal of no impairment by proposed cavr sips for iowa  wisconsin and minnesota have been submitted to the epa for review and approval 
these sips include best available retrofit technology rule bart emission controls and other additional measures needed for reducing state contributions to regional haze 
the epa has not issued final action to approve these cavr sips 
if a cavr sip is found to be deficient  then the epa is required to promulgate a cavr fip to address these requirements in the interim until the cavr sip is approved 
the cavr sips will determine required compliance actions and deadlines 
in august  a legal challenge was filed by several groups citing the epa s failure to issue timely approval of cavr sip submissions or alternatively issue cavr fips 
in december  the epa published a proposed consent decree in response to the legal challenge  which would require the epa to finalize cavr plans for iowa  wisconsin and minnesota by june as a result of the lawsuit  there are uncertainties in the applicability of and compliance outcomes of bart control approaches that will be approved by the epa for inclusion in cavr sips 
egu emissions of primary concern for bart and regional haze regulation include so  nox and pm 
there are pending obligations under the epa s cavr to complete bart determinations that would evaluate control options to reduce these emissions at certain fossil fueled ipl and wpl egus that were under construction between and ipl s facilities that may be impacted include burlington unit  george neal units and  prairie creek unit  ml kapp unit and lansing unit wpl s facilities that may be impacted include edgewater unit  nelson dewey unit and columbia units and the dc circuit court remand of cair to the epa in and stay of csapr in may have an indirect impact on the cavr and bart sip implementation approach 
the epa allowed bart obligations for so and nox emissions to be fulfilled by cair often referred to as cair equals bart 
in addition  in december  the epa issued a proposed rule that similarly would allow bart obligations for so and nox emission to be fulfilled by csapr 
the epa s assessment of the relationship for the cavr s bart requirements relative to cair and csapr remains uncertain pending the dc circuit court s review of these regulations 
in addition  there are uncertainties whether additional emission reductions could be required to address regional haze impacts beyond bart 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are unable to predict with certainty the impact that cavr might have on the operations of their existing egus until the epa finalizes cavr plans for iowa  wisconsin and minnesota 
utility mact rule in december  the epa issued the final utility mact rule  also referred to as mats 
the mats rule applies to all ipl and wpl coal fueled egus with greater than mw of capacity located in iowa  wisconsin and minnesota 
the final rule requires compliance with emission limits for mercury  filterable pm as a substitute for non mercury metal haps and hydrogen chloride hcl as a substitute for acid gas haps 
the epa also proposed alternative standards for total or individual non mercury metals emissions instead of filterable pm and so emissions instead of hcl for acid gases if a scrubber is installed 
in addition  work practice standards were proposed for organic haps emissions to 
table of contents ensure proper combustion 
compliance is currently anticipated to be required by april however  an entity can request an additional year for compliance  which may be granted on a case by case basis by state permitting authorities for units that are needed to assure power reliability  units repowering to gas  or units that need additional time to install air emission control technology 
in addition  the issuance of the final utility mact rule is expected to initiate a review of  and possible revisions to  the wisconsin state mercury rule 
the final utility mact rule is subject to legal challenge in the dc circuit court 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently evaluating the final utility mact rule  but expect that capital investments and or modifications to their electric generating facilities could be significant to comply with the regulation 
wisconsin state mercury rule the wisconsin state mercury rule requires electric utility companies in wisconsin to meet compliance requirements to reduce annual mercury emissions by from a historic baseline beginning in phase i 
in addition  the wisconsin state mercury rule requires large coal fueled egus with greater than mw of capacity to either achieve a annual mercury emissions reduction standard or limit the annual concentration of mercury emissions to pounds of mercury per gigawatt hour beginning in phase ii 
small coal fueled egus between mw and mw of capacity must install best available control technology bact by january to reduce mercury emissions 
as an alternative  this rule allows large and small egus to achieve compliance through averaging of covered emissions 
there is also an alternative multi pollutant option that extends the time for compliance with the annual mercury reduction requirement until for large units 
however  this requires the affected facilities to achieve nox and so reductions beyond those currently required by federal and state regulations 
in  wpl filed its compliance plan with the wisconsin department of natural resources dnr 
wpl s plan states that it will utilize large and small egu averaging to comply with the additional mercury rule emissions reduction requirements that commence in and not use the multi pollutant option 
the issuance of the final utility mact rule is expected to initiate a review of  and may cause revisions to  the wisconsin state mercury rule 
alliant energy and wpl continue to evaluate the impact of this state mercury rule and the federal utility mact rule discussed above to determine further mercury emission reductions that will be required 
wisconsin ract rule in  the epa designated counties in southeastern wisconsin as non attainment areas for the ozone naaqs 
this designation includes sheboygan county  where wpl operates the sheboygan falls energy facility and edgewater 
in  the wisconsin dnr issued a ract rule that requires nox emission reductions at egus as part of the federal ozone sip submittal to address non attainment areas in wisconsin 
facility modifications are not necessary at the sheboygan falls energy facility to comply with this rule 
as part of its environmental compliance plan  wpl completed investments for installation of nox emission control technologies at edgewater to meet the to compliance requirements phase i 
wpl is currently installing an scr system at edgewater to achieve compliance with the requirements that include facility boiler nox rate limitations and a mass emissions cap phase ii 
refer to strategic overview environmental compliance plans wpl s emission control projects for discussion of the scr system being implemented for further nox emission reductions at edgewater to meet compliance deadlines 
industrial boiler and process heater mact rule in march  the epa published the final industrial boiler and process heater mact rule with a compliance deadline of march the rule is expected to apply to ipl s prairie creek boilers  and  and fossil fueled auxiliary boilers and process heaters operated at other ipl and wpl fossil fueled facilities 
the rule requires compliance with haps emission limitations and work practice standards 
in may  the epa published a stay postponing the effective date of the industrial boiler and process heater mact rule for major sources of emissions 
in addition  the epa announced reconsideration of the march final rule 
in december  the epa issued a proposed reconsidered rule for public comment 
in january  the dc circuit court vacated the epa s stay and reinstated the compliance deadline of march the epa currently expects to issue a final reconsidered rule by april  with an expected compliance date of mid the final rule remains subject to legal challenges in the dc circuit court 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are monitoring future developments relating to this rule and plan to update their environmental compliance plans as needed 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently unable to predict with certainty the outcome of the industrial boiler and process heater mact rule  but expect that capital investments and or modifications to its electric generating facilities to meet compliance requirements of the rule could be significant 
ozone naaqs rule in  the epa announced reductions in the primary naaqs for eight hour ozone to a level of parts per million ppm from the previous standard of ppm 
in december  the epa responded to initial state recommendations and is proposing to designate sheboygan county in wisconsin as non attainment 
wpl operates the sheboygan falls energy facility and edgewater in sheboygan county  wisconsin 
the epa is expected to designate final non attainment areas by the second quarter of the schedule for compliance with this standard has not yet been established

air permit renewal challenges alliant energy and wpl are aware of certain public comments or petitions from citizen groups that have been submitted to the wisconsin dnr or to the epa regarding the renewal of air operating permits at certain of wpl s generating facilities 
in some cases  the epa has responded to these comments and petitions with orders to the wisconsin dnr to reconsider the air operating permits of wpl s generating facilities 
wpl has received renewed air permits for columbia  edgewater and nelson dewey from the wisconsin dnr  which considered all public comments received as part of the renewal process 
columbia in  the sierra club submitted a notice of intent to sue the epa for failure to respond to its petition encouraging the epa to challenge the air permit issued by the wisconsin dnr for columbia 
in  the epa issued an order on the sierra club petition and granted one of three issues from the sierra club petition  objecting to that portion of the permit issued by the wisconsin dnr 
in september  the wisconsin dnr proposed a construction permit and a revised operation permit for columbia 
in october  wpl submitted comments objecting to the appropriateness of the proposed draft permits 
in november  the comment period closed  and in february  the wisconsin dnr made the determination not to issue either of the proposed new permits 
in february  the sierra club filed a lawsuit against the epa in the us district court for the western district of wisconsin seeking to have the epa take over the permit process 
the sierra club alleges the epa must now act on the reconsideration of the permit since the wisconsin dnr has exceeded its day timeframe in which to respond to the epa s order 
in may  the wisconsin dnr proposed a revised draft operation permit for columbia

water quality section b of federal clean water act the federal clean water act requires the epa to regulate cooling water intake structures to assure that these structures reflect the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impacts to fish and other aquatic life 
the second phase of this epa rule is generally referred to as section b 
section b applies to existing cooling water intake structures at large steam egus 
in  a court opinion invalidated aspects of section b  which allowed for consideration of cost effectiveness when determining the appropriate compliance measures 
as a result  the epa formally suspended section b in in  the us supreme court granted the epa authority to use a cost benefit analysis when setting technology based requirements under section b 
in march  the epa issued a revised proposed section b rule  which applies to existing and new cooling water intake structures at large steam egus and manufacturing facilities

wisconsin and iowa state thermal rules section a of the federal clean water act requires the epa to regulate thermal impacts from wastewater discharges of industrial facilities  including those from egus 
states have authority to establish standards for these discharges in order to minimize adverse environmental impacts to aquatic life 
all ipl and wpl facilities are subject to these standards upon state promulgation  which become applicable upon their incorporation into a facility s wastewater discharge permit 
in january  the wisconsin natural resources board adopted its state standard for regulating the amount of heat that facilities can discharge into wisconsin waters 
this rule was necessary because the epa determined that wisconsin had not developed a state thermal standard consistent with section a of the federal clean water act 
the wisconsin state thermal rule was approved by the epa in october in iowa  the iowa dnr is required to regulate thermal impacts from wastewater discharges of industrial facilities  including ipl facilities that discharge water into nearby rivers and streams 
compliance with the thermal rules will be evaluated on a case by case basis when wastewater discharge permits for ipl s and wpl s generating facilities are renewed 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl continue to evaluate the thermal rule regulatory requirements and the compliance options available to meet the heat limitations for discharges from ipl s and wpl s egus 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are unable to predict with certainty the final requirements of this rule until wastewater discharge permits for impacted facilities are renewed

furthermore  while implementation of these regulations continues to proceed  the impacts of these regulations remain subject to change as a consequence of the complexity and magnitude of determining how to effectively control ghgs under the existing legal framework of the caa  which may include the epa and state agency interpretations of appropriate permitting and emission compliance requirements 
the outcome of these regulations and challenges will determine whether and how ghg stationary sources  including electric utility operations  will be regulated under the caa 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently unable to predict the timing and nature of stationary source rules for ghg emissions including future issuance of regulations that would mandate reductions of ghgs  including carbon dioxide co emissions  at electric utilities 
in  the epa issued a final endangerment and cause or contribute findings for ghg under the caa with an effective date of january this final action includes two distinct findings regarding ghg emissions under the caa 
first  the current and projected concentrations of ghg emissions in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations 
this is referred to as the endangerment finding and includes the six key ghg emissions identified in the epa s mandatory ghg reporting rule 
second  the combined emissions of co  methane ch  nitrous oxide no  and hydrofluorocarbons hfcs from new motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines contribute to the atmospheric concentrations of these key ghg emissions and hence to the threat of climate change 
this is referred to as the cause or contribute finding 
in  the epa  under authority from the ghg endangerment and cause or contribute findings  also issued a final rule that regulates ghg emissions from motor vehicles as a pollutant under the caa 
this finding and rule are subject to legal challenges in the dc circuit court 
these actions by the epa enable it to regulate ghg stationary sources  including electric utility operations and natural gas distribution operations 
epa mandatory ghg reporting rule in  the final epa mandatory ghg reporting rule became effective 
the final rule does not require control of ghg emissions  rather it requires that sources above certain threshold levels monitor and report emissions 
the epa anticipates that the data collected by this rule will improve the us government s ability to formulate a set of climate change policy options 
the ghg emissions covered by the final epa reporting rule include co  ch  no  sulfur hexafluoride  hfcs  perfluorocarbons and other fluorinated gases 
the primary ghg emitted from alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s utility operations is co from the combustion of fossil fuels at their larger egus 
emissions of ghg are reported at the facility level in coe and include those facilities that emit  metric tons or more of coe annually 
ipl and wpl submitted their first ghg annual emissions reports for calendar year by the sep 
 due date 
alliant energy continues to maintain and update its emissions monitoring methodologies and data collection procedures to capture all the ghg emissions data required for ongoing compliance with the epa s mandatory ghg reporting rule 
this rule is subject to a legal challenge that is pending in the dc circuit court 
alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s annual emissions  in terms of total mass of coe  as reported to the epa for electric utility and natural gas distribution operations  were as follows in millions alliant energy ipl wpl tons metric tons tons metric tons tons metric tons coe emissions a a coe emissions reported to the epa represent all emissions from the facilities operated by ipl and wpl and do not reflect their share of co owned facilities operated by other companies 
epa nsps for ghg emissions from electric utilities in  the epa announced the future issuance of ghg standards for electric utilities under the caa 
the ghg emission limits are to be established as nsps for new and existing fossil fueled egus 
the epa entered a settlement agreement that required the issuance of proposed regulations for new and existing power plants by july  and final regulations no later than may  the epa announced the issuance of proposed regulations will be delayed for existing egus  but has not yet established a new schedule 
the epa proposed rule for new egus is also delayed  and is expected to be issued in the first quarter of for existing egus  the nsps issued by the epa is expected to include emission guidelines that states must use to develop plans for reducing egu ghg emissions 
the guidelines will be established based on demonstrated controls  ghg emission reductions  costs and expected timeframes for installation and compliance 
under existing epa regulations  states must submit their plans to the epa within nine months after publication of the guidelines unless the epa sets a different schedule 
states have the ability to apply less or more stringent standards  or longer or shorter compliance schedules 
the schedule for compliance with these rules has not yet been established 
the implications of the epa s nsps rule for ghg emissions from egus are highly uncertain  including the nature of required emissions controls and compliance timeline for mandating reductions of ghgs 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently unable to predict with certainty the final outcome  but expect that expenditures to comply with any regulations to reduce ghg emissions could be significant 

table of contents epa ghg tailoring rule in  the epa issued the ghg tailoring rule  which became effective on jan 
 the rule establishes a ghg emissions threshold for major sources under the psd construction permit and title v operation permit programs at  tons per year tpy of coe 
the rule also establishes a threshold for what will be considered a significant increase in ghg emissions 
new major sources and significantly modified existing sources of ghg will be required to obtain psd construction permits that demonstrate bact emissions measures to minimize ghg emissions 
the rule establishes a phased in implementation schedule for compliance with these ghg permitting requirements 
through june  ghg requirements only applied to sources that were already required to obtain caa permits for other non ghg pollutants 
effective july  ghg requirements apply to all new major sources and modifications at existing major sources that increase ghg emissions by at least  tpy for coe 
the rule is subject to a legal challenge that is pending in the dc circuit court 
the implications of the epa s ghg tailoring rule are highly uncertain  and alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently unable to predict with certainty the impact on their financial condition or results of operations  but expect that expenditures to comply with these regulations to reduce ghg emissions could be significant

based on capital projects placed into service in  alliant energy currently estimates its total bonus depreciation deductions to be claimed on its us federal income tax return will be approximately million includes million for ipl and million for wpl 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently unable to estimate their bonus depreciation deductions to be claimed on their us federal income tax return but believe bonus depreciation deductions will likely contribute to an annual federal net operating loss in alliant energy s federal net operating losses carryforwards are currently expected to offset future federal taxable income through resulting in minimal federal cash tax payments to the irs by alliant energy  ipl and wpl through refer to note of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the sbja and the act 
ndaa in december  the ndaa was enacted 
the most significant provision of the ndaa for alliant energy  ipl and wpl eliminates a negative impact for regulated utilities that elect the cash grant for renewable energy projects 
prior to the enactment of ndaa  if a regulated utility elected the cash grant incentive for a renewable energy project  the utility was required to provide the benefits from the cash grant to their customers over the regulatory life of the related project assets or incur a tax normalization violation 
as a result of the enactment of ndaa  utilities are no longer subject to a tax 
table of contents normalization violation if they provide the benefits of the cash grant incentive to their customers over a shorter time period than the regulatory life of the project assets 
this provision of the ndaa can be applied retroactively to renewable energy projects placed into service since as a result of the enactment of ndaa  alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently evaluating their options for government incentive elections for ipl s whispering willow east wind project and wpl s bent tree phase i wind project

liquidity and capital resources overview alliant energy  ipl and wpl believe they have  and expect to maintain  adequate liquidity to operate their businesses as a result of available capacity under their revolving credit facilities  ipl s sales of accounts receivable program and operating cash flows generated by their utility business 
based on their liquidity and capital structures  alliant energy  ipl and wpl believe they will be able to secure the additional capital required to implement their strategic plans and meet their long term contractual obligations 
access by alliant energy  ipl and wpl to capital markets to fund their future capital requirements at reasonable terms is largely dependent on their respective credit quality and on developments in those capital markets

table of contents capital structure alliant energy  ipl and wpl plan to maintain debt to total capitalization ratios that are consistent with their investment grade credit ratings in order to facilitate ongoing and reliable access to capital markets on reasonable terms and conditions 
alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s capital structures at dec 
 were as follows dollars in millions alliant energy consolidated ipl wpl common equity preferred stock noncontrolling interest long term debt incl 
current maturities short term debt in addition to capital structures  other important financial considerations used to determine the characteristics of future financings include financial coverage ratios  flexibility in capital spending plans  regulatory orders and rate making considerations  the levels of debt imputed by rating agencies  market conditions and the impact of tax initiatives 
the most significant debt imputations include operating leases  a portion of the daec  kewaunee and riverside ppas  and postretirement benefits obligations 
the pscw explicitly factors certain imputed debt adjustments in establishing a regulatory capital structure as part of wpl s retail rate cases  particularly those related to operating leases and ppas 
the iub and mpuc do not make any explicit adjustments for imputed debt in establishing capital ratios used in determining customer rates  although such adjustments are considered by ipl in recommending an appropriate capital structure 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl intend to manage their respective capital structures and liquidity positions in such a way that does not compromise their ability to raise the necessary funds required to provide utility services reliably and at reasonable costs  while maintaining financial capital structures consistent with those approved by regulators 
key considerations include maintaining access to the financial markets on the terms  in the amounts and within the timeframes required to fund their strategic plans  retaining a prudent level of financial flexibility and maintaining their investment grade credit ratings 
the capital structure is only one of a number of components that needs to be actively managed in order to achieve these objectives 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl currently expect to maintain capital structures in which total debt would not exceed to  and preferred stock would not exceed to  of total capital 
these targets may be adjusted depending on subsequent developments and their impact on alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s respective weighted average cost of capital and investment grade credit ratings 
credit and capital market developments alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s ability to facilitate or to provide reliable and cost effective utility services depends on their reliable access to cost effective capital 
financial markets that were subjected to considerable strain since have shown signs of selective recovery 
certain business sectors  including the regulated utility sector  have attracted and retained investor interest in the equity and debt capital markets 
however  areas of concern remain  including certain issues in the us and internationally that have impacted the availability of credit and the liquidity of financial assets 
among these are the evolving financial situation in europe and the economic expansion in china and other emerging countries  with their respective consequences for international liquidity 
there is also concern about the level of spending by the us federal government and the temporary monetary policies of the federal reserve system intended to spur economic growth  with potential implications over time for inflation and interest rate levels 
the evolving profile and impact of financial market regulation  both in the us and internationally  contributes to the unsettled tone of the global financial markets 
these developments translate into uncertainties and volatility regarding the availability of capital and for the terms and conditions of capital raised to meet funding requirements 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are aware of the potential implications that these credit and capital market developments might have on their ability to raise the external funding required for their respective operations and capital expenditure plans 
the strategic implications include protecting their respective liquidity positions and avoiding over reliance on short term funding 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl maintain revolving credit facilities to provide backstop liquidity to their commercial paper programs  ensure a committed source of liquidity in the event the commercial paper market becomes disrupted and manage their respective long term debt maturity profiles 
in addition  alliant energy and ipl maintain a sales of accounts receivable program at ipl as an alternative financing source 
as discussed below  alliant energy  ipl and wpl retain flexibility in undertaking their capital expenditure programs  particularly with respect to capital expenditures timing associated with investment programs within their respective strategic plans 
primary sources and uses of cash alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s most significant source of cash is from electric and gas sales to their utility customers 
cash from these sales reimburses ipl and wpl for prudently incurred expenses to provide service to their utility customers and provides ipl and wpl a return on the assets used to provide such services 
utility operating cash flows are expected to cover the majority of ipl s and wpl s capital expenditures required to maintain 
table of contents their current infrastructure and to pay dividends to alliant energy s shareowners 
capital needed to retire debt  as well as to fund capital expenditures related to environmental compliance programs and other strategic projects  is expected to be met primarily through external financings 
ongoing monitoring of credit and capital market conditions allows management to evaluate the availability of funding and the terms and conditions attached to such financing 
in order to maintain debt to total capitalization ratios that are consistent with investment grade ratings  alliant energy  ipl and wpl may periodically fund such capital requirements with additional debt and equity

table of contents other matters market risk sensitive instruments and positions alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s primary market risk exposures are associated with commodity prices  investment prices and interest rates 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl have risk management policies to monitor and assist in controlling these market risks and use derivative instruments to manage some of the exposures 
refer to notes i and of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s derivative instruments 
commodity price alliant energy  ipl and wpl are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of commodities they procure and market 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl employ established policies and procedures to mitigate their risks associated with these market fluctuations including the use of various commodity derivatives and contracts of various durations for the forward sale and purchase of these commodities 
alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s exposure to commodity price risks in their utility businesses is also significantly mitigated by current rate making structures in place for recovery of their electric production fuel and purchased energy expenses fuel related costs as well as their cost of natural gas purchased for resale 
ipl s electric and gas tariffs and wpl s wholesale electric and gas tariffs provide for subsequent monthly adjustments to their tariff rates for material changes in prudently incurred commodity costs 
ipl s and wpl s rate mechanisms  combined with commodity derivatives  significantly reduce commodity risk associated with their electric and gas margins 
wpl s retail electric margins have the most exposure to the impact of changes in commodity prices for alliant energy and wpl due largely to the current retail recovery mechanism in place in wisconsin for fuel related costs  which became effective on jan 
 the cost recovery mechanism applicable for wpl s retail electric customers is based on forecasts of fuel related costs expected to be incurred during forward looking test year periods and fuel monitoring ranges determined by the pscw during each retail electric rate proceeding or in a separate fuel cost plan approval proceeding 
under the new cost recovery mechanism  if wpl s actual fuel related costs fall outside this fuel monitoring range during the test period  wpl is authorized to defer the incremental under over collection of fuel related costs from retail electric customers that are outside the approved ranges 
deferral of under collection of fuel related costs are reduced to the extent wpl s return on common equity during the fuel cost plan year exceeds the most recently authorized return on common equity 
wpl s retail fuel related costs incurred in were higher than forecasted retail fuel related costs approved by the pscw in december resulting in an under collection of fuel related costs for of approximately million 
the amount of under collected fuel related costs for did not fall outside of the fuel monitoring range and therefore did not qualify for deferral 
in december  the pscw approved annual forecasted fuel related costs per mwh of based on million of variable fuel costs for wpl s test period 
these fuel related costs  excluding deferred csapr compliance costs  will be monitored using an annual bandwidth of plus or minus 
the december order also required wpl to defer direct csapr compliance costs that are not included in the fuel monitoring level and set a zero percent tolerance band for the csapr related deferral 
subsequent to the pscw order issued in december  the dc circuit court stayed the implementation of csapr and cair remains effective 
alliant energy and wpl are currently unable to predict the final outcome of the csapr stay and its impact on their financial condition or results of operations 
based on the cost recovery mechanism in wisconsin and the annual forecasted fuel related costs and fuel monitoring range approved by the pscw in december  alliant energy and wpl currently estimate the commodity risk exposure to wpl s electric margins in is approximately million 
this amount excludes any potential additional risk if wpl s return on common equity during exceeds its most recently authorized return on common equity

refer to critical accounting policies and estimates pensions and other postretirement benefits for the impacts of changes in discount rates on retirement plan obligations and costs 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates that affect results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the financial statements 
based on historical experience and various other factors  alliant energy  ipl and wpl believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to their business and the understanding of their financial results as they require critical assumptions and judgments by management 
the results of these assumptions and judgments form the basis for making estimates regarding the results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual financial results may differ materially from these estimates 
alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s management has discussed these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of their board of directors 
refer to note of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s accounting policies and the estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
contingencies alliant energy  ipl and wpl make assumptions and judgments each reporting period regarding the future outcome of contingent events and record loss contingency amounts for any contingent events that are both probable and reasonably estimated based upon current available information 
the amounts recorded may differ from the actual income or expense that occurs when the uncertainty is resolved 
the estimates that alliant energy  ipl and wpl make in accounting for contingencies  and the gains and losses that they record upon the ultimate resolution of these uncertainties  could have a significant effect on the results of operations and the amount of assets and liabilities in their financial statements 
note of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements provides discussion of contingencies assessed at dec 
 including various pending legal proceedings that may have a material impact on alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s financial condition and results of operations 
regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities alliant energy s utility subsidiaries ipl and wpl are regulated by various federal and state regulatory agencies 
as a result  they are subject to accounting guidance for regulated operations  which recognizes that the actions of a regulator can provide reasonable assurance of the existence of an asset or liability 
regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities arise as a result of a difference between gaap and the accounting principles imposed by the regulatory agencies 
regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred as they are probable of recovery in future customer rates 
regulatory liabilities represent obligations to make refunds to customers and amounts collected in rates for which the related costs have not yet been incurred 
ipl and wpl recognize regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities in accordance with the rulings of their federal and state regulators and future regulatory rulings may impact the carrying value and accounting treatment of alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl make assumptions and judgments each reporting period regarding whether their regulatory assets are probable of future recovery and their regulatory liabilities are probable future obligations by considering factors such as regulatory environment changes  rate orders issued by the applicable regulatory agencies and historical decisions by applicable regulatory agencies regarding similar regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities 
the judgments used by regulatory authorities have an impact on the recovery of costs  the rate of return on invested capital and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates 
a change in these judgments may result in a material impact on alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s results of operations and the amount of assets and liabilities in their financial statements 
note b of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements provides details of the nature and amounts of alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities assessed at dec 
 as well as material changes to these regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities during long lived assets alliant energy  ipl and wpl complete periodic assessments regarding the recoverability of certain long lived assets when factors indicate the carrying value of such assets may be impaired 
these assessments require significant assumptions and judgments by management 
the long lived assets assessed for impairment generally include assets within their non regulated operations  which are not yet generating cash flows  and assets within their regulated operations  which may not be fully recovered from ipl s and wpl s customers as a result of regulatory decisions in the future 

table of contents non regulated operations factors considered in determining if an impairment review is necessary for long lived assets within non regulated operations include a significant underperformance of the assets relative to historical or projected future operating results  a significant change in the use of the acquired assets or business strategy related to such assets  and significant negative industry  regulatory or economic trends 
when an impairment review is deemed necessary  a comparison is made between the expected undiscounted future cash flows and the carrying amount of the asset 
if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the expected undiscounted future cash flows  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the fair value is determined by the use of quoted market prices  appraisals  or the use of valuation techniques such as expected discounted future cash flows 
alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s long lived assets within their non regulated operations assessed in included the franklin county wind project and wind sites currently expected to be used to develop future wind projects 
franklin county wind project in  alliant energy decided to utilize the remaining mw of wind turbine generator sets and related equipment from a master supply agreement with vestas at resources to build a non regulated mw wind project in iowa  referred to as the franklin county wind project 
alliant energy performed an evaluation of the recoverability of the carrying value of the franklin county wind project given reductions in forward electricity prices in and concluded the undiscounted cash flows expected from the franklin county wind project during its estimated useful life exceeded its carrying value as of dec 
  resulting in no impairment 
changes in the estimated cash flows could result in the undiscounted cash flows being less than the carrying amount and a future material impairment could be required 
primary factors that could have an effect on the future expected cash flows for the project include the price of electricity generated from the project during its useful life  the amount of government incentives available for the project  costs to construct the project  the volume of electricity generated and the expected life of the project 
an impairment of the franklin county wind project could be triggered in the future if long term electricity prices stay at current depressed levels or decline even further  if resources is not able to complete the wind project in time to qualify for government incentives  if costs to construct the project significantly exceed current estimates or if the expected output or life of the project is significantly reduced 
as of dec 
  the capitalized expenditures for the project were million  excluding any capitalized interest costs 
the franklin county wind project is currently expected to cost up to million  excluding any capitalized interest costs  to complete 
undeveloped wind sites as of dec 
  alliant energy  ipl and wpl have undeveloped wind sites with capitalized costs of million  million and million  respectively  related to ipl s mw of wind site capacity in franklin county  iowa and wpl s mw of wind site capacity in freeborn county  minnesota 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl assessed the recoverability of these undeveloped wind sites given further reductions in forward fossil fuel prices in and concluded no impairments were required as of dec 
 changes in the estimated cash flows from these remaining undeveloped wind sites could result in the undiscounted future cash flows from the wind sites being less than the carrying amount of the wind sites and a future material impairment could be required 
the future expected cash flows from the undeveloped wind sites are dependent on the future demand of wind energy in the region where the wind sites are located 
the future demand of wind energy in the region where the wind sites are located is dependent on various factors including future government incentives for wind projects  energy policy and legislation including federal and state renewable energy standards and regulation of carbon emissions  electricity and fossil fuel prices  transmission constraints in the region where the wind sites are located and further technological advancements for wind generation 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl currently believe  based on a combination of the various factors  further wind development in the region where the wind sites are located will occur 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl could realize an impairment related to these wind sites if one or more of these factors are no longer expected to occur  or actions by regulatory agencies with jurisdiction over ipl or wpl indicate the costs of the undeveloped wind sites would not be approved to be recovered from customers 
regulated operations long lived assets within regulated operations are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate all or a portion of the carrying value of the assets may be disallowed for rate making purposes 
if ipl or wpl are disallowed recovery of any portion of the carrying value of their regulated property  plant and equipment  an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount of the carrying value that was disallowed 
if ipl or wpl are disallowed a full or partial return on the carrying value of their regulated property  plant and equipment  an impairment charge is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and the present value of the future revenues expected from their regulated property  plant and equipment 
alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s long lived assets that may not be fully recovered from customers that were assessed in included the whispering willow east wind project and generating units subject to early retirement 
whispering willow east wind project refer to note e of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of an million impairment of the minnesota retail portion of ipl s whispering willow east wind project costs during based on the mpuc s august order 

table of contents generating units subject to early retirement due to current and proposed environmental regulations including  among others  the utility mact rule issued by the epa in december and csapr issued by the epa in july  alliant energy  ipl and wpl are evaluating future plans for their electric generation fleet 
one of the outcomes of the evaluation could be the early retirement of certain older and less efficient egus 
when it becomes probable that an egu will be retired before the end of its useful life  alliant energy  ipl and wpl must assess whether it is probable that less than full recovery will be provided by its regulators on the remaining carrying value of the egu 
if it is probable that regulators will not allow full recovery of and a return on the remaining carrying amount of the asset  an impairment charge is recorded for the portion of the remaining carrying value that is disallowed recovery 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl completed an evaluation of their egus that are being assessed for early retirement in and concluded no impairment charges were required as of dec 
 changes in the probability of regulators allowing full recovery of and return on the remaining carrying amount of these egus could result in future material impairments 
unbilled revenues unbilled revenues are primarily associated with alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s utility operations 
energy sales to individual customers are based on the reading of customers meters  which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month 
amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated at the end of each reporting period and the corresponding estimated unbilled revenue is recorded 
the unbilled revenue estimate is based on daily system demand volumes  estimated customer usage by class  weather impacts  line losses and the most recent customer rates 
such process involves the use of various judgments and assumptions and significant changes in these judgments and assumptions could have a material impact on alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s results of operations 
as of dec 
  unbilled revenues associated with alliant energy s utility operations were million million at ipl and million at wpl

alliant energy  ipl and wpl make assumptions and judgments periodically to estimate the obligations and costs related to their retirement plans 
there are many judgments and assumptions involved in determining an entity s pension and other postretirement liabilities and costs each period including employee demographics including age  life expectancies and compensation levels  discount rates  assumed rate of returns and funding 
changes made to the plan provisions may also impact current and future benefits costs 
judgments and assumptions are supported by historical data and reasonable projections and are reviewed at least annually 
as of dec

income taxes alliant energy  ipl and wpl are subject to income taxes in various jurisdictions 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl make assumptions and judgments each reporting period to estimate their income tax assets  liabilities  benefits and expenses 
judgments and assumptions are supported by historical data and reasonable projections 
significant changes in these judgments and assumptions could have a material impact on alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s financial condition and results of operations 
alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s critical assumptions and judgments for include projections of alliant energy s future taxable income used to determine its ability to utilize net operating loss and credit carryforwards prior to their expiration  state apportionment projections and the interpretation of tax laws regarding uncertain tax positions 
federal net operating loss carryforward utilization alliant energy s federal tax returns for calendar years and have included net operating losses primarily due to bonus depreciation deductions allowed in its tax return  and a change in tax method of accounting for mixed service costs and bonus depreciation deductions allowed in its tax return 
alliant energy also currently anticipates a federal net operating loss on its federal tax returns for calendar years and primarily due to additional bonus depreciation deductions eligible under new tax legislation enacted in and contributions made to alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s qualified defined benefit pension plans in federal net operating losses for each calendar year can be utilized to offset federal taxable income in other years by generally carrying the losses back two years or forward years 
alliant energy carried back a portion of the net operating losses generated in and currently plans to utilize the remaining portion of its federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately billion at dec 
 to offset federal taxable income in the future 
based on current projections of alliant energy s future federal taxable income  alliant energy currently plans to utilize its current federal net operating loss carryforwards prior to their expiration  therefore no valuation allowances have been recorded by alliant energy  ipl and wpl for deferred tax assets associated with their federal net operating loss carryforwards as of dec 
 changes in assumptions regarding alliant energy s future federal taxable income could require valuation allowances in the future resulting in a material impact on alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s financial condition and results of operations 
federal tax credit carryforward utilization alliant energy generates federal tax credits each year primarily based on the amount of electricity generated by wind projects at ipl and wpl and the amount of its research and development activities 
in addition  in prior years  alliant energy generated significant non conventional source fuel credits 
federal tax credits reduce alliant energy s federal income tax obligations in calendar years that alliant energy generates sufficient federal taxable income to utilize the tax credits 
if alliant energy does not generate sufficient federal taxable income to utilize the federal tax credits generated for that year  the federal tax credits can be carried back and carried forward to be utilized to reduce federal income tax in prior or subsequent years 
the federal tax credits have different expiration periods with the most stringent limiting the carryforward period to years 
alliant energy currently plans to utilize the remaining portion of its federal tax credit carryforward of approximately million at dec 
 to offset federal tax obligations in the future 
based on current projections of alliant energy s future federal taxable income  alliant energy currently plans to utilize all current federal tax credit carryforwards prior to their expiration  therefore no valuation allowances have been recorded by alliant energy  ipl and wpl for deferred tax assets associated with their federal tax credit carryforwards as of dec 
 changes in assumptions regarding alliant energy s future federal taxable income could require valuation allowances in the future resulting in a material impact on alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents state net operating loss carryforward utilization alliant energy  ipl and wpl generated significant state net operating losses over the past years that are currently being carried forward 
at dec 
  alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s state net operating loss carryforwards are estimated at billion  billion and billion  respectively 
at dec 
  alliant energy s state net operating losses being carried forward had expiration dates ranging from through with expiring after dates ranging from through for ipl and dates ranging from through for wpl 
based on current projections of their future state taxable income  alliant energy  ipl and wpl plan to utilize a significant majority of their current state net operating loss carryforwards prior to their expiration 
note of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements provides further discussion of carryforwards including million of income tax benefits recognized by alliant energy in from the reversal of a portion of the valuation allowances for state net operating loss carryforwards recorded as of dec 
 due to wisconsin tax legislation enacted in changes in assumptions regarding alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s future state taxable income could require valuation allowances in the future resulting in a material impact on their financial condition and results of operations 
state apportionment alliant energy  ipl and wpl utilize state apportionment projections to record their deferred tax assets and liabilities each reporting period 
deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements are recorded utilizing currently enacted tax rates and estimates of future state apportionment rates expected to be in effect at the time the temporary differences reverse 
these state apportionment projections are most significantly impacted by the estimated amount of revenues expected in the future from each state jurisdiction for alliant energy s consolidated tax group  including both its regulated operations and its non regulated operations 
a significant change in the forecasted amount of revenues from each state jurisdiction for alliant energy s consolidated tax group could have a material impact on alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s deferred tax assets and liabilities 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl may record approximately million  million and million  respectively  of income tax expense in due to changes in state apportionment projections caused by the planned sale of the rmt business 
a significant majority of any additional income tax expense recognized from changes in state apportionment projections will be recorded at ipl and wpl due to their large deferred tax liability positions at dec 
 refer to notes c and of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of regulatory accounting for taxes and details of uncertain tax positions  respectively 
other future considerations in addition to items discussed earlier in mda  the combined notes to consolidated financial statements in item and risk factors in item a  the following items could impact alliant energy s  ipl s or wpl s future financial condition or results of operations ipl s tax benefit rider in  the iub authorized ipl to create a regulatory liability account and credit such account for any potential tax benefits resulting from changes in tax accounting methodologies and tax elections available under the internal revenue code 
as of dec 
  alliant energy and ipl have recognized million of regulatory liabilities from the aggregate amount of such tax benefits estimated to date  of which million was utilized to credit ipl s retail electric customer bills in iowa in and million is expected to be utilized to credit ipl s retail electric customer bills in iowa in the remaining amounts of regulatory liabilities to be returned to customers under the tax benefit rider will be determined by the iub in the future and is dependent on the amount of tax benefits sustained under irs audit and therefore is subject to change 
alliant energy and ipl have also recognized million of regulatory assets to date to reflect the benefit ipl expects to receive from its iowa retail customers in the future through increased rates as the significant temporary differences associated with these tax benefits reverse into current income tax expense in the future 
the potential tax benefits addressed by the tax benefit rider relate to the tax treatment of the allocation of flood insurance proceeds isolated to and repair expenditures and mixed service costs that are expected to continue in the future 
the iub authorized ipl to continue to credit such regulatory liability account with the tax benefits from repairs expenditures and mixed service costs until such time as the irs finalizes the audit for such tax benefits 
once the irs finalizes the audit of the deductions for repairs expenditures and mixed service costs  any future tax benefits resulting from such deductions at ipl  along with ipl s reversal of previously recorded regulatory assets related to such tax benefits  will be recorded to alliant energy s and ipl s income tax expense rather than recorded to their regulatory liabilities 
depending on when the irs finalizes the audit of the deductions for repairs expenditures and mixed service costs and the amount of such deductions in future periods compared to the amount of temporary differences from historical tax benefits that are reversing into income tax expense in future periods  alliant energy and ipl could incur material changes to income tax expense in the future beginning as early as refer to note b of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the tax benefit rider 

table of contents electric transmission service charges rates charged by itc ipl currently receives substantially all its transmission services from itc 
the annual transmission service rates that itc charges its customers are calculated each calendar year using a ferc approved cost of service formula rate template referred to as attachment o 
the attachment o rate is based on itc s projected net revenue requirement for the upcoming calendar year ie the year the rates will be billed as well as a true up adjustment for any over or under recovered amounts from the previous calendar year ie two years prior to the year the rates will be billed 
because attachment o is a ferc approved formula rate  itc can implement new rates each calendar year without filing a request with ferc 
however  new rates are subject to challenge by ferc if the rates proposed by itc are determined by ferc to be unjust or unreasonable or another mechanism is determined by ferc to be just and reasonable 
in september  itc filed with miso the attachment o rate it proposes to charge its customers in for electric transmission services 
the proposed rate was based on itc s net revenue requirement for as well as a true up adjustment credit of approximately million related to amounts that itc over recovered from its customers in the attachment o rate filed with miso is approximately the same as the rate itc charged its customers in  which included the impact of a million true up adjustment related to amounts that itc under recovered from its customers in in january  the iub issued an order authorizing ipl to use million of the regulatory liability related to its electric transmission assets sale to offset the iowa retail portion of the under recovered costs expected to be billed to ipl by itc in excluding the impacts of the under recovered costs from that were offset with regulatory liabilities in  ipl currently estimates the electric transmission service costs expected to be billed in will be approximately million to million higher than the comparable costs billed in ipl expects to recover a significant portion of these higher transmission service costs in with the automatic transmission cost recovery rider approved by the iub and implemented in february refer to rate matters for additional details of the transmission cost recovery rider 
ferc audit of itc ferc audit staff conducted an audit of itc s compliance with certain of the ferc s regulations and conditions established in ferc s approval of itc s acquisition of ipl s electric transmission assets 
in september  ferc audit staff issued an audit report that identified certain findings and recommendations related to specific aspects of the accounting treatment for the acquisition which  if approved by ferc  have the potential to result in adjustments to itc s annual revenue requirement calculations and corresponding refunds to ipl 
in october  itc filed a request challenging the ferc audit staff s findings related to the accounting treatment for the acquisition 
alliant energy and ipl are currently unable to determine the ultimate impact that this matter may have on their financial condition and results of operation  but believe the outcome could be material to their future electric transmission service expense billed by itc 
miso transmission cost allocation in july  miso filed a proposed revised tariff with ferc for a new category of transmission projects called multi value projects mvps 
mvps include new large scale transmission projects that enable the reliable and economic delivery of energy in support of documented energy policy mandates or provide economic value across multiple pricing zones within miso 
the mvp category is intended to facilitate the integration of large amounts of location constrained resources including renewable resources  support miso member and customer compliance with evolving state and federal energy policy requirements  enable miso to address multiple reliability needs and provide economic opportunities through regional transmission development 
the proposed revised tariff would allow certain costs of mvps to be socialized across the entire miso footprint based on energy usage by the miso participants to ensure that areas within the miso footprint that have large amounts of generation and a small share of load are not allocated a disproportionate amount of the costs for mvps 
in december  ferc conditionally approved miso s proposal for the mvp transmission cost allocation 
in july  miso submitted a compliance filing  which ferc conditionally approved in october  and also requested that miso submit additional compliance filings 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently unable to determine the ultimate impact that the revised tariff may have on their financial condition and results of operation  but believe the outcome could be material to their future electric transmission service expense 
government incentives for wind projects alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s generation plans have included building wind projects to produce electricity to meet customer demand and renewable portfolio standards 
in addition to producing electricity  these wind projects may also generate material incentives depending on when they are placed in service 
the arra enacted in provided incentives to owners of wind projects placed into service between jan 
 and dec 
 the incentive options available to qualified wind projects under the arra include production tax credits for a year period based on the electricity output generated by the wind project  an investment tax credit equal to of the qualified cost basis of the wind project  or a government grant equal to of the qualified cost basis of wind projects that began construction in and in  the tax relief  unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of modified the requirements for the government grant incentive 
the government grant incentive is now available for qualified wind projects that began construction in  and and are placed into service by dec 
 
table of contents alliant energy s generation plan has four wind projects that currently qualify  or may qualify  for one of the government incentives 
the four wind projects are wpl s cedar ridge wind project mw capacity that began generating electricity in late  ipl s whispering willow east wind project mw capacity that began generating electricity in late  wpl s bent tree phase i wind project mw capacity that began generating electricity in late  and resources franklin county wind project mw capacity that is currently under construction 
based on an evaluation of the most beneficial alternative for customers  alliant energy  ipl and wpl chose to recognize production tax credits for the three eligible wind projects that are already generating electricity 
in december  the ndaa was enacted 
as a result  utilities are no longer subject to a tax normalization violation if they provide the benefits of the government grant incentive to their customers over a shorter time period than the regulatory life of the project assets 
this provision of the ndaa can be applied retroactively to renewable energy projects placed into service since as a result of the enactment of ndaa  alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently re evaluating their options for government incentive elections for ipl s whispering willow east wind project and wpl s bent tree phase i wind project 
resources currently anticipates applying for the government grant incentive for its franklin county wind project  which is expected to be placed into service by the end of refer to legislative matters for further discussion of the ndaa 
production tax credits as stated above  alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently re evaluating their options for the governmental incentive elections as a result of the ndaa 
if alliant energy  ipl and wpl decide not to pursue a retroactive election of the government grant incentive  they will continue to earn production tax credits for their wind projects already generating electricity 
the amount of production tax credits earned is dependent on the level of electricity output generated by each wind project  which is impacted by a variety of operating and economic parameters including transmission availability 
any incentives for ipl s and wpl s wind projects are expected to be utilized in determining customers rates 
production tax credits earned in  and  along with estimates of production tax credits currently expected to be earned in  for these wind projects are as follows in millions whispering willow east ipl cedar ridge wpl bent tree phase i wpl atc in april  duke energy corporation and atc announced the creation of duke american transmission co 
datc  a joint venture that is expected to build  own and operate new electric transmission infrastructure in north america 
in september  datc announced its first set of transmission projects  which include seven new transmission lines in five midwestern states to be constructed over the next years for an aggregate cost of approximately billion 
these transmission projects are subject to approval by various regulatory agencies 
wpl currently owns a ownership interest in atc 
wpl s investment in atc generated equity income of million and cash distributions of million in for alliant energy and wpl 
alliant energy and wpl are currently unable to determine what impacts the joint venture and transmission line projects noted above will have on their future equity income  distributions from atc  capital contributions to atc  or ownership in atc 
incentive compensation plans alliant energy s total compensation package includes an incentive compensation program  which provides substantially all of alliant energy s non bargaining employees an opportunity to receive annual short term incentive cash payments based on the achievement of specific annual operational and financial performance measures 
the operational performance measures for relate to diversity  safety  customer satisfaction  service reliability and the availability of certain generating facilities 
the financial performance measures for relate to utility earnings per share from continuing operations and cash flows from operations generated by ipl  wpl and corporate services  as adjusted pursuant to the terms of the oip 
in addition  the total compensation program for certain key employees includes long term incentive awards issued under an equity incentive plan 
alliant energy allocates a significant portion of incentive compensation plan costs to ipl and wpl 
refer to alliant energy s results of operations utility other operation and maintenance expenses for discussion of higher incentive related compensation expenses in and note b of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for details of long term incentive awards
