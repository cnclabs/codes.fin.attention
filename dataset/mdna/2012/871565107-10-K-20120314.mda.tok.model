item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintained allowances for doubtful accounts   as of december   for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments and for disputed claims and quality issues 
the allowance is based upon a review of outstanding receivables  historical collection information and existing economic conditions 
the company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and generally does not require collateral 
receivables are generally due within to days 
delinquent receivables are written off based on individual credit evaluations and specific circumstances of the customer 
inventory reserves the company establishes a reserve for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and current market conditions 
as of december   the company has  accrued for inventory obsolescence and market reserves 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those estimated by management  additional inventory reserves may be required 
environmental reserves as noted in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k  the company has accrued  as of december   in environmental remediation costs which  in management s best estimate  are sufficient to satisfy anticipated costs of known remediation requirements as outlined in note expenditures related to costs currently accrued are not discounted to their present values and are expected to be made over the next three to four years 
however  as a result of the evolving nature of the environmental regulations  the difficulty in estimating the extent and necessary remediation of environmental contamination  and the availability and application of technology  the estimated costs for future environmental compliance and remediation are subject to uncertainties and it is not possible to predict the amount or timing of future costs of environmental matters which may subsequently be determined 
changes in information known to management or in applicable regulations may require the company to record additional remediation reserves 
impairment of long lived assets the company continually reviews the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances  also referred to as triggering events  indicate that the carrying value of a long lived asset or group of assets the assets may no longer be recoverable 
triggering events include a significant decline in the market price of the assets  a significant adverse change in the operating use or physical condition of the assets  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate impacting the assets value  including regulatory issues such as environmental actions  the generation by the assets of historical cash flow losses combined with projected future cash flow losses  or the expectation that the assets will be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of the useful life of the assets 
the company concluded that there were no indications of impairment requiring further testing during the year ended december  if the company concluded that  based on its review of current facts and circumstances  there were indications of impairment  testing of the applicable assets would be performed 
the recoverability of the assets to be held and used is tested by comparing the carrying amount of the assets at the date of the test to the sum of the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by those assets over the remaining useful life of the assets 
in estimating the future undiscounted cash flows  the company uses projections of cash flows directly associated with  and which are expected to arise as a direct result of  the use and eventual disposition of the assets 
this approach requires significant judgments including the company s projected net cash flows  which are derived using the most recent available estimate for the reporting unit containing the assets tested 
several key assumptions would include periods of operation  projections of product pricing  production levels  product costs  market supply and demand  and inflation 
if it is determined that the carrying amount of the assets are not recoverable  an impairment loss would be calculated equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their fair value 
assets classified as held for sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
assets to be disposed of other than by sale are classified as held and used until the assets are disposed or use has ceased 
goodwill the company has goodwill of  recorded as part of its acquisition of manufacturers soap and chemical company  operating within the chemicals segment  and  recorded as part of its acquisition of ram fab  inc  operating within the metals segment 
goodwill  which represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired  is tested for impairment at least on an annual basis 
the initial step of the goodwill impairment test involves a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill is recorded  with its carrying amount 
if the reporting unit s fair value exceeds its carrying value  no impairment loss is recognized and the second step  which is a calculation of the impairment  is not performed 
however  if the reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value  an impairment charge equal to the difference in the carrying value of the goodwill and the implied fair value of the goodwill is recorded 
implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if it had been acquired in a business combination 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts allocated to assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
in making our determination of fair value of the reporting unit  we rely on the discounted cash flow method 
this method uses projections of cash flows from the reporting unit 
this approach requires significant judgments including the company s projected net cash flows  the weighted average cost of capital wacc used to discount the cash flows and terminal value assumptions 
we derive these assumptions used in our testing from several sources 
many of these assumptions are derived from our internal budgets  which would include existing sales data based on current product lines and assumed production levels  manufacturing costs and product pricing 
we believe that our internal forecasts are consistent with those that would be used by a potential buyer in valuing our reporting units 
the wacc rate is based on an average of the capital structure  cost of capital and inherent business risk profiles of the company 
the assumptions used in our valuation are interrelated 
the continuing degree of interrelationship of these assumptions is  in and of itself a significant assumption 
because of the interrelationships among the assumptions  we do not believe it would be meaningful to provide a sensitivity analysis on any of the individual assumptions 
however  one key assumption in our valuation model is the wacc 
if the wacc  which is used to discount the projected cash flows  were higher  the measure of the fair value of the net assets of the reporting unit would decrease 
conversely  if the wacc were lower  the measure of the fair value of the net assets of the reporting unit would increase 
changes in any of the company s other estimates could also have a material effect on the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the reporting unit s assets 
based on the company s goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of  each reporting unit s fair value exceeded its carrying value  therefore no further testing was required and no impairment loss was recognized 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows used in operating activities during and totaled  and  an improvement in cash flows of  cash flows in were generated from net income totaling  before depreciation and amortization expense of  cash flows were adversely affected by an  increase in inventories in  as year end balances increased  net of reserves  from  at the end of to  at the end of substantially all of the increase occurred in the metals segment to support higher sales projections  a sales mix shift to higher cost special alloy products along with the company deciding to begin stocking select special alloy finished goods products to be responsive to projected customer demands 
accounts receivable increased by  in  net of reserves  as a result of the higher metals segment sales activity during the fourth quarter of compared to the same period of  combined with an increased number of days sales outstanding for fabrication sales 
higher priced special alloy inventory purchases made during the fourth quarter of increased the accounts payable balance at the end of by  when compared to the year end balance 
operating cash flows were favorably affected by higher accrued expenses at the end of compared to the end of of  as profit based incentives increased  reflecting higher profits earned and advances from customers prepayments from customers used to purchase raw materials required for piping systems projects increased  in compared to cash flows used in operating activities during totaled  compared to cash flows provided by continuing operations during of  or a decline in cash flows of  from to cash flows provided by discontinued operations for was  cash flows in were generated from net income totaling  before depreciation and amortization expense of  cash flows were adversely affected in by a  increase in the company s inventories as inventories increased  net of reserves  from  at the end of to  at the end of substantially all of the increase occurred in the metals segment to support higher sales projections 
accounts receivable increased by  in  net of reserves  reflecting a percent increase in sales in the fourth quarter of over the fourth quarter of in addition  accounts payable increased  in  resulting primarily from the timing of the receipt of and payment for stainless steel raw materials by the metals segment at year end 
also negatively impacting cash flows in was a decline in accrued expenses at the end of compared to the end of of  as advances from customers prepayments from customers used to purchase raw materials required for piping systems projects declined  and a customer product claim was paid during for  these amounts were partially offset by higher accruals for profit based incentives of  reflecting higher profits earned in compared to in  the company s current assets increased  and current liabilities increased  from the year ended amounts  which caused working capital for to increase by  to  from the total of  the current ratio for the year ended december   increased to from the year end ratio of the company also used cash during for investing activities to fund capital expenditures of  financing activities during generated  through net borrowings on long term debt and the company paid a dividend on december  amounting to  the company expects that along with the existing amount of cash on hand  cash flows from operations and available borrowings will be sufficient to make debt payments if any  fund estimated capital expenditures of  and have sufficient resources to expand into other business opportunities 
on june   the company entered into a credit agreement with a regional bank to provide a  line of credit that expires on june  this agreement was amended by the bank on august  to extend the maturity date of the credit agreement by one additional year to june  none of the other terms of the credit agreement were modified 
the company s previous debt facility  with a different lender  was going to expire at the end of interest on the new credit agreement is calculated using the one month libor rate  plus a pre defined spread  which is determined by the company s total funded debt to ebitda ratio 
borrowings under the line of credit are limited to an amount equal to a borrowing base calculation that includes eligible accounts receivable  inventories and cash surrender value of the company s life insurance 
additionally  the credit facility requires an agreement not to pledge the fixed assets of the company 
covenants under the debt agreement include maintaining a certain funded debt to ebitda ratio  a minimum tangible net worth  and total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio 
the company is also limited to a maximum amount of capital expenditures per year  which is sufficient for the company s projected needs 
management does not believe that these covenants and restrictions will have an adverse effect on its operations 
results of operations comparison of to consolidated for the fiscal year ending december   the company generated net earnings of  or per share  on sales of  compared to net earnings of  or per share  on sales of  in the prior year 
the company generated net earnings of  or per share  on sales of  in the fourth quarter of  compared to net earnings of  or per share  on sales of  in the fourth quarter of consolidated gross profits increased percent to  in  compared to  in  and  as a percent of sales  increased to twelve percent of sales in compared to eleven percent of sales in for the fourth quarter of  consolidated gross profits was  an increase of ten percent from the fourth quarter of of  consolidated gross profits were twelve percent of sales for the fourth quarter of and the increases in dollars and in percentage of sales were attributable to the metals segment as discussed in the metals segment comparison of to below 
consolidated selling  general and administrative expense for increased by  compared to  and was seven percent of sales for  up from six percent for these costs increased  during the fourth quarter of compared to the same period of and increased to nine percent of sales from six percent of sales for the fourth quarters of and  respectively 
the dollar increase for both the year and fourth quarter of when compared to the same periods of resulted primarily from an  increase in bad debt expense for the chemicals segment  an increase in management performance based incentives  the loss of outsourcing reimbursements and higher salaries and wages  employee benefits and contract labor 
all of these items will be discussed in greater detail in the respective sections below 
comparison of to consolidated for  the company generated net earnings from continuing operations of  or per share  on sales of  compared to net earnings from continuing operations of  or per share  on sales of  in the prior year 
the company generated net earnings from continuing operations of  or per share  on sales of  in the fourth quarter of  compared to a net loss from continuing operations of  or loss per share  on sales of  in the fourth quarter of the company did not have discontinued operations for but generated a net loss from discontinued operations of  which had no effect of earnings per share  and a net loss of  or loss per share  for the fiscal year and fourth quarter of  respectively 
as a result  the company earned  or per share  and  or per share  for the fiscal year and fourth quarter of  respectively  compared to net earnings of  or per share  and a net loss of  or loss per share  for the same periods in consolidated gross profits from continuing operations increased percent to  in  compared to  in  and as a percent of sales increased to eleven percent of sales in compared to nine percent of sales in most of the improvement in dollars and in percentage of sales was attributable to the metals segment as discussed in the metals segment comparison of to below 
consolidated selling  general and administrative expense for increased by  compared to  and was six percent and nine percent of sales for and  respectively 
the dollar increase resulted primarily from including a full year of selling and administrative costs for ram fab in compared to four months in also  management incentive bonuses  which are based on profits  increased in compared to metals segment the following table summarizes operating results and backlogs for the three years indicated 
reference should be made to note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
amounts in thousands amount amount amount net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expense operating income loss year end backlogs piping systems comparison of to metals segment the metals segment sales increased percent for as compared to primarily as a result of a twelve percent increase in average selling prices coupled with a five percent increase in unit volumes 
sales for the fourth quarter of increased nine percent over results as a result of a percent increase in unit volumes partially offset by a six percent decrease in average selling prices 
gross profit for increased percent to  or twelve percent of sales  compared to s year end total of  or nine percent of sales 
for the fourth quarter of  gross profit was  or twelve percent of sales  an increase of percent over the fourth quarter of of  or eleven percent of sales 
the segment experienced operating income of  up percent  and  up percent  for the year and fourth quarter of compared to  and  respectively  for same periods of the segment experienced a favorable product mix in with higher priced non commodity unit volume increasing percent while commodity unit volume decreased two percent 
the favorable product mix also affected the fourth quarter shipments  with non commodity unit volumes increasing percent for the quarter while commodity unit volumes increased eight percent 
special alloy product shipments surpassed prior year levels as a result of increased customer projects and distributor restocking 
the improved unit volumes for the year and fourth quarter are also the result of increased market share in north america and strong increases in international sales 
pipe manufacturing operating margins strengthened throughout the year due to the favorable product mix while fabrication margins were under pressure from underutilized capacity in the market 
increased fabrication quote activity could indicate a turnaround in their sales and profitability 
operating income increased for the segment despite nickel prices falling for most of the year 
as nickel prices decrease  selling prices are reduced accordingly while material costs reflect the higher priced inventory 
although there is no way to precisely calculate the effect of price level changes on profits  the company estimates that for the year and fourth quarter of  the segment experienced a negative effect of  and  respectively 
nickel prices rose in the prior year which resulted in an increase to operating income of  and  for the year and fourth quarter of selling  general and administrative expense increased  or twelve percent in when compared to this expense category was five percent of sales for both periods 
the increase resulted from higher performance based bonuses for select segment employees combined with increased salaries and wages and employee procurement expenses as additional sales executives were hired for the fabrication product line along with wage increases for senior levels executives as their responsibilities expanded to include the entire metals segment 
comparison of to metals segment the metals segment sales increased percent for the year ended compared to from a percent increase in unit volumes combined with a two percent increase in average selling prices 
gross profit for increased percent to  or nine percent of sales  from year end s total of  or six percent of sales 
operating income for was  compared to an operating loss of  for sales for the fourth quarter of increased percent to  from sales of  in the fourth quarter of  resulting from an percent increase in unit volumes and a percent increase in average selling prices 
the segment had a gross profit of  or eleven percent of sales  for the fourth quarter of compared to a gross profit of  or one percent of sales  for the fourth quarter of the segment generated operating income of  in the fourth quarter of compared to an operating loss of  for the fourth quarter of the large unit volume improvement for compared to was essentially the result of increased commodity pipe sales resulting from an aggressive effort to gain market share combined with a modest increase in non commodity products 
although sales prices per pound increased about percent for both the commodity and non commodity products  the change in product mix to a much higher percentage of commodity pipe resulted in the modest overall selling price increase 
operating income for also reflects a  charge during the first quarter for a product claim made by a metals segment customer and  was expensed for this claim in   of which was recorded in the fourth quarter of fourth quarter unit volumes increased as a result of the aforementioned aggressive marketing effort partially offset by lower non commodity unit sales 
fourth quarter s selling prices  when compared to s fourth quarter  reflects primarily much higher prices for non commodity products resulting from selling more expensive special alloys 
higher stainless steel prices and a change in product mix to a higher percent of lower priced commodity pipe also impacted the average selling price 
the improvement in fourth quarter operating income came primarily from our fabrication operations 
fabrication s backlog was  at the end of the fourth quarter of compared to  at the end of the fourth quarter of selling  general and administrative expense increased  or percent in when compared to  and was five percent of sales compared to six percent of sales for and  respectively 
the dollar increase was attributable to including a full year of ram fab s selling  general and administrative expense during compared to only four months for since ram fab was acquired by the company on august  also  higher performance based bonuses were earned for resulting from higher profits for the current year 
specialty chemicals segment the following tables summarize operating results for the three years indicated 
reference should be made to note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
amounts in thousands amount amount amount net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expense operating income comparison of to specialty chemicals segment sales for the specialty chemicals segment increased one percent for  ending the year at  compared to  in pounds shipped for the year were eleven percent lower than the prior year 
for the fourth quarter of  sales were  up two percent from s fourth quarter sales of  pounds shipped for the quarter were down ten percent from the prior year 
the segment experienced a favorable product mix during the year and fourth quarter of  with increased sales of higher priced products combined with a slightly higher selling price as the segment passed along a portion of its raw material cost increases to its customers 
gross profit for the year was  down percent from the prior year amount of  as a percent of sales  gross profit was percent of sales and was percent of sales 
the fourth quarter showed gross profit of  or percent of sales  and  or percent of sales  for and  respectively 
the reduction in gross profit for the year and fourth quarter resulted from increased raw material costs and the segment s desire to maintain increase market share by not passing on all of the increased costs to its customers 
operating income for the year decreased percent from the prior year 
operating income for was  or five percent of sales  while recorded  or nine percent of sales 
the segment showed an operating loss of  or one percent of sales  for the fourth quarter of the fourth quarter of recorded operating income of  or eight percent of sales 
during december  the segment recorded an  charge to reserve for the potential uncollectable receivable balances for four customers 
the bulk of the charge was for a customer who experienced financial difficulty during the last half of management attempted to develop a long term payment strategy for the customer but was never able to develop a plan suitable to both parties 
selling  general and administrative expense increased  or percent in when compared to  and increased to eight percent of sales in compared to seven percent in for the fourth quarter  selling  general and administrative expense was  in  an increase of  when compared to the same period of the increase in the reserve for potential uncollectable receivables in december   as explained in the prior paragraph  resulted in the entire increase 
comparison of to specialty chemicals segment the specialty chemicals segment sales increased percent for the year ended compared to gross profit for the year ended increased percent to  or percent of sales  compared to a gross profit of  or percent of sales  for operating income increased percent to  for the year ended compared to  earned in sales increased percent to  for the fourth quarter of compared to  for the fourth quarter of gross profit for the fourth quarter of was  or percent of sales  which approximated the fourth quarter of s total of  or percent of sales 
operating income declined one percent to  for the fourth quarter of compared to  for the fourth quarter of the sales gain came from increases in the sulfated product line and additives for dust control and agricultural chemicals 
contract manufacturing also contributed to the sales growth 
the declines in gross profit and operating income for the fourth quarter of  when compared to the same period in  were caused primarily by our inability to pass on all of the increases in raw material costs  especially from naturally occurring fats and oils and petroleum derivatives 
selling  general and administrative expense increased  or seven percent in compared to the amount  and decreased to seven percent of sales in from eight percent of sales in the increase resulted primarily from increased selling commissions from the increase in sales in compared to plus higher performance based bonuses for the current year 
unallocated income and expense reference should be made to note to the consolidated financial statements  included in item of this form k  for the schedule that includes these items 
comparison of to corporate corporate expenses for were  or two percent of sales  compared to  or one percent of sales  for this represents an increase of  or percent 
the most significant contributor to the increase was higher performance based bonuses for select corporate employees which increased  during compared to the company also experienced higher stock option compensation costs and consulting fees  partially offset by lower professional fees 
during the second quarter of  the company relocated its corporate office and the company was no longer able to provide administrative services to the spartanburg manufacturing facility which the company sold in this resulted in the loss of reimbursement for the costs of providing these functions to the buyer of this facility during along with higher office rent expense 
comparison of to corporate corporate expense decreased  or percent  to  or one percent of sales  for  compared to  or two percent of sales  in the decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in environmental expenses that were eliminated by the sale of the spartanburg manufacturing facility at the end of the third quarter of there was no environmental expense during  compared to  in the remainder of the decrease resulted from lower performance based bonuses for higher bonuses were awarded in due to the ram fab acquisition and manufacturing facility dispositions see note and note 
interest expense in decreased  from as a result of lower outstanding debt balances during compared to other expense for the prior year reflects a  medical settlement with a former employee of the company s augusta  georgia chemical operation which was closed in no similar charge occurred in the current year 
contractual obligations and other commitments as of december   the company s contractual obligations and other commitments were as follows amounts in thousands payment obligations for the year ended total thereafter obligations revolving credit facility interest payments operating leases purchase obligations deferred compensation total for a description of the deferred compensation obligation  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
current conditions and outlook the metals segment s business is highly dependent on its customers capital expenditures which have begun to show some improvement 
excess capacity in the pipe manufacturing industry continues to present a difficult operating environment 
stainless steel surcharges  which affect the cost of raw materials and selling prices declined in may through january but have been increasing for february and march of these recent increases should generate customer interest to purchase inventory in the near term 
rising surcharges should also limit the segment s exposure to any further inventory losses 
we believe we are the largest and most capable domestic producer of non commodity stainless steel pipe and an effective producer of commodity stainless steel pipe which should serve us well in the long run 
our market position remains strong in the commodity pipe market and we are experiencing a significant upswing in project and special alloy demand both domestically and internationally 
we also continue to be optimistic about the fabrication business over the long term 
there has been a noticeable increase in fabrication quote requests 
approximately percent of the fabrication current backlog comes from paper and wastewater treatment projects with chemical projects accounting for an additional percent 
fabrication s backlog was  at december  and  at january  we expect our fabrication backlog to continue to increase over the next quarter or two as our sales force converts the previously mentioned new inquiries into firm orders 
we estimate that approximately percent of the fabrication backlog should be completed over the next twelve months 
specialty chemicals segment s sales continue to show improvement into  building on the trend started in the fourth quarter of the company expects sales volumes to continue to improve throughout as a result of aggressive product pricing 
even though raw material costs have stabilized over the last several months  management expects costs to start increasing beginning late in the first quarter of the segment expects that a major defoamer project will be implemented in  which would have the potential for a significant impact on sales and profitability for there can  however  be no assurance that this project will be implemented 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company is exposed to market risks from adverse changes in interest rates 
changes in u 
s 
interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash and cash equivalents as well as interest paid on its indebtedness 
except as described below  the company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions  nor does it hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its borrowing activities used to maintain liquidity and fund business operations 
fair value of the company s debt obligations  which approximated the recorded value  consisted of at december   under a  revolving line of credit expiring on june  with a variable interest rate of percent 
at january   under a  revolving line of credit expiring on june  with a variable interest rate of percent
