sales and marketing as of june   pac van s sales and marketing team consisted of employees 
the branch managers also play a critical role in pac van s sales and marketing programs 
members of pac van s sales group act as its primary customer service representatives and are responsible for fielding calls  obtaining credit applications  quoting prices  following up on quotes and handling orders 
the sales team is responsible for developing and managing local relationships  as well as making both inbound and outbound calls 
the sales team assists customers define and understand their space needs  assesses potential opportunities  quotes deals  closes transactions and obtains the necessary documentation 
upon completing a lease or a sale the sales team works closely with the local branch operations team to ensure that pac van is able to meet or exceed customer expectations 
pac van s centralized support services group handles all billing  collections and other support functions  allowing its sales and marketing team to focus on addressing the needs of its customers 
pac van s marketing group is primarily responsible for coordinating direct mail  internet marketing and other advertising campaigns  producing company literature  creating promotional sales tools and managing its customer relationship management system 
pac van s centralized support services group handles all billing  collections and other support functions  allowing its sales and marketing team to focus on addressing the needs of its customers 
pac van s marketing programs emphasize product quality  service capabilities  the cost savings and convenience of using its products versus constructing temporary or permanent offices or storage facilities 
pac van markets its services through a number of promotional vehicles  including the internet  yellow pages  prominent branding of its equipment  telemarketing  targeted mailings  trade shows and limited advertising in publications 
the development of pac van s marketing programs are developed by branch managers  regional vice presidents and senior management  all of whom participate in devising branch by branch marketing strategies based on fleet availability and forecasted demand 
pac van s branch managers  working with its corporate marketing team  determine the timing  content and target audience of direct mailings  specials and promotional offers  while the corporate office manages the marketing process itself to ensure the consistency of its message  achieve economies of scale and relieve its local branches of the administrative responsibility of running its marketing programs 
pac van believes that its approach to marketing is consistent with the local nature of its business and allows each branch to employ a customized marketing plan that fosters growth within its particular market 
management information systems pac van s management information systems are instrumental to its lease fleet management and targeted marketing efforts and allow management to monitor operations at branches on a daily  weekly  and monthly basis 
lease fleet information is updated daily at the branch level and verified through routine physical inventories by branch i 
table of contents personnel 
this provides management with on line access to utilization  lease fleet unit levels and rental revenues by branch or geographic region 
in addition  an electronic file for each unit showing its lease history and current location and status is maintained in the information system 
branch sales people utilize the system to obtain information regarding unit condition and availability 
the database tracks individual units by serial number and provides comprehensive information including cost  condition and other financial and unit specific information 
employees as of june   pac van had employees 
none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement and management believes its relationship with employees is good 
we have never experienced any material labor disruption and are unaware of any efforts or plan to organize our employees 
the employee groups are as follows senior and branch management corporate staff sales and marketing branch operations and administration in addition  at june   we have four full time employees at our gfn corporate office in pasadena  california 
regulatory matters we must comply with various federal  state and local laws and regulations in connection with our operations 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with these laws and regulations 
in addition to compliance costs  we may incur costs related to alleged environmental damage associated with past or current properties owned or leased 
we believe that our liability  if any  for any environmental remediation will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
however  we cannot be certain that the discovery of currently unknown matters or conditions  new laws and regulations  or stricter interpretations of existing environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business or operations in the future 
a portion of pac van s units are subject to regulation in certain states under motor vehicle and similar registrations and certificate of title statutes 
we believe that we have complied in all material respects with all motor vehicle registration and similar certificate of title statutes in states where such statutes clearly apply to modular space units 
however  in certain states  the applicability of such statutes to its modular space units is not clear beyond doubt 
if additional registration and related requirements are deemed to be necessary in such states or if the laws in such states or other states were to change to require compliance with such requirements  pac van could be subject to additional costs  fees and taxes as well as administrative burdens in order to comply with such statutes and requirements 
we do not believe the effect of such compliance will be material to our business  results of operations or financial condition 
trademarks we entered into a licensing agreement with triton corporation in may for the use of the royal wolf name and trademark in connection with its retail sales and leasing of intermodal cargo containers and other container applications in the domestic storage market within australia and new zealand and surrounding islands in the pacific islands region 
we paid triton corporation  to license the trademark 
the license will continue in perpetuity as long as royal wolf continues to use the royal wolf name and trademark as the exclusive name for its business and mark for its products  subject to the termination provisions of the license 
the license may be terminated by the licensor upon days notice in the event royal wolf breaches its obligations under the license and will terminate automatically if royal wolf becomes insolvent or ceases to sell products under the trademark for a continuous period of months 
gfn sold the royal wolf name and trademark to royal wolf in may in connection with the australian ipo of rwh 
there are no claims pending against royal wolf challenging its right to use the royal wolf name and trade mark within royal wolf s region of business

table of contents item a 
risk factors in addition to the other information in our annual report on form k  you should consider the risks described below that we believe may be material to investors in evaluating us 
this section contains forward looking statements  and in considering these statements  you should refer to the qualifications and limitations on our forward looking statements that are described in safe harbor statement before the beginning of item global economic conditions and market disruptions may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
there continues to be global economic uncertainty  elevated levels of unemployment  reduced levels of economic activity  and it is uncertain as to when economic conditions will improve 
these negative economic conditions in the markets where we operate  and other events or factors that adversely affect demand in the portable services industry  could continue to adversely affect our business 
though we have strengthened our efforts in collections and inventory control  continued worsening of conditions could adversely affect the collection of trade receivables on a timely basis  could result in additional reserves for uncollectible accounts and  in the event of continued contraction in container and modular unit sales and leasing  could lead to a build up of inventory and lease fleet levels 
these factors would have a further adverse impact on operating results and cash flows 
in addition  fluctuations in the rates of exchange for the us dollar against the australian  new zealand and canadian dollars could significantly affect our results of operations through lower than anticipated reported revenues and profitability as a result of the translation of our foreign operations financial results into us dollars 
we operate with a significant amount of indebtedness  which is secured by all or substantially all of our assets  subject to variable interest rates and contain restrictive covenants 
our substantial indebtedness could have adverse consequences  such as require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations at royal wolf and pac van to payments on our indebtedness  which could reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund future operating capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes  expose us to the risk of increased interest rates  as our borrowings on our secured senior credit facilities are at variable rates of interest  require us to sell assets to reduce indebtedness or influence our decisions about whether to do so  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and our industry  restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or pursuing business opportunities  limit  along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness  among other things  our ability to borrow additional funds  and violating covenants in these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  including substantially increasing our cost of borrowing and restricting our future operations  if not cured or waived 
in addition  the lenders may be able to terminate any commitments they had made to supply us with further funds 
accordingly  we may not be able to fully repay our debt obligations  if some or all of our debt obligations are accelerated upon an event of default 
our senior credit agreements also contain various restrictive covenants that limit the operations of our business 
in particular  these agreements include covenants and restrictions relating to payments and distributions to gfn  liens and sale leaseback transactions  loans and investments  debt and hedging arrangements  mergers  acquisitions and asset sales  transactions with affiliates  and changes in business activities 
i 
table of contents there were no events of default under the covenants of our senior credit facilities at june  while we believe we will remain in compliance with covenants in the foreseeable future and that our relationships with our senior lenders are good  there is no assurance our lenders would consent to an amendment or waiver in the event of noncompliance  or that such consent would not be conditioned upon the receipt of a cash payment  revised principal payout terms  increased interest rates  or restrictions in the expansion of the credit facilities for the foreseeable future  or that our senior lenders would not exercise rights that would be available to them  including  among other things  demanding payment of outstanding borrowings 
in addition  our ability to obtain additional capital or alternative borrowing arrangements at reasonable rates may be adversely affected 
all or any of these adverse events would further limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to downturns in our business 
reference is made to note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our indebtedness 
our inability to raise capital 
our inability to obtain capital in the amounts and at the times when needed  may have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  including substantially increasing our cost of borrowing and restricting our future operations 
these events may significantly reduce the value of your investment 
a write off of all or a part of our goodwill and intangibles would hurt our operating results and reduce our stockholders equity 
as a result of our acquisitions of royal wolf  pac van and other smaller businesses  we have recorded significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of the total purchase price of these acquisitions over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
we are not permitted to amortize goodwill under us accounting standards and instead we review goodwill  as well as intangible assets  at least annually for impairment 
impairment may result from  among other things  deterioration in the performance of acquired businesses  adverse market conditions and adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations  including changes that restrict the activities of the acquired business 
in the event impairment is identified  a charge to earnings would be recorded 
although it does not affect our cash flow  a write off of all or a part of our goodwill or intangibles would adversely affect our operating results and stockholders equity 
at each yearend of the two fiscal years prior to june   we recognized an impairment charge to the goodwill recorded in the pac van acquisition 
at june   there was no impairment charge recorded  but future write downs may be occur if conditions  such as those discussed above  would adversely impair our operations 
reference is made to note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding goodwill and intangible assets 
future acquisitions of businesses could subject us to additional business  operating and industry risks  the impact of which cannot presently be evaluated  and could adversely impact our capital structure 
we intend to pursue acquisition opportunities in an effort to diversify our investments and grow our business 
any business we acquire may cause us to be affected by numerous risks inherent in the acquired business operations 
if we acquire a business in an industry characterized by a high level of risk  we may be affected by the currently unascertainable risks of that industry 
although we will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular industry or target business  we cannot assure that we will be able to properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors 
in addition  the financing of any acquisition we complete could adversely impact our capital structure as any such financing would likely include the issuance of additional equity securities and or the borrowing of additional funds 
the issuance of additional equity securities may significantly reduce the equity interest of our stockholders and or adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock 
increasing our indebtedness could increase the risk of a default that would entitle the holder to declare all of such indebtedness due and payable and or to seize any collateral securing the indebtedness 
in addition  default under one debt instrument could in turn permit lenders under other debt instruments to declare borrowings outstanding under those other instruments to be due and payable pursuant to cross default clauses 
accordingly  the financing of future acquisitions could adversely impact our capital structure and any equity interests in us 
while part of our long term business strategy is to acquire additional businesses  there is no assurance that we will be able to identify businesses that we can acquire upon terms we believe acceptable  or if such acquisitions require additional financing  that we could obtain such additional financing 
we cannot ascertain the availability of businesses to acquire  nor the capital requirements for future transactions 
we cannot assure that  if required  additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
to the extent that additional financing proves to be unavailable when needed to consummate a particular acquisition  we would be compelled to either restructure the i 
table of contents transaction or abandon that particular acquisition 
in addition  if we consummate a future acquisition  we may require additional financing to fund the operations or growth of the target business 
the failure to secure additional financing may impact the continued development or growth of the target business 
our long term growth plan includes the expansion of operations into markets outside of the united states and the asia pacific area 
such international expansion may not prove successful  and may divert significant capital  resources and management s time and attention and adversely affect our on going operations 
to date  we have conducted all of our business within north america and the asia pacific area 
however  we have intentions in the future to enter international markets  including possibly south america and the european markets  which will require substantial amounts of management time and attention 
our products and overall marketing approach may not be accepted in other markets to the extent needed to make our international expansion profitable 
in addition  the additional demands on management from these activities may detract from our efforts in our current markets and adversely affect our operating results therein 
any international expansion will expose us to the risks normally associated with conducting international business operations  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  changes in foreign legislation  possible foreign currency controls  currency exchange rate fluctuations or devaluations  tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  difficulties in obtaining and managing vendors and distributors  potential negative tax consequences and difficulties collecting accounts receivable 
our long term growth could strain our management resources 
our future performance will depend in large part on our ability to manage our long term planned growth that could strain our existing management  human and other resources 
to successfully manage this growth  we must continue to add managers and employees and improve our operating  financial and other internal procedures and controls 
we also must effectively motivate  train and manage employees 
if we do not manage our growth effectively  it would adversely affect our future operating results 
to complete future business combinations  we may issue shares of our capital stock that would reduce the equity interest of our stockholders and could cause a change in control of our ownership  or incur debt  which could adversely affect our financial condition 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to  shares of common stock and up to  shares of preferred stock 
at june   there were  authorized shares of our common stock available for issuance after appropriate reservation for the issuance of shares upon full exercise of our outstanding warrants and options issued under our stock incentive plan see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
if we seek to consummate future business combinations  we may be required to issue a substantial number of additional shares of our common or preferred stock  or a combination of common and preferred stock  to complete the other business combination 
the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or any number of shares of our preferred stock may significantly reduce the equity interest of investors  may subordinate the rights of holders of common stock if preferred stock is issued with rights senior to those afforded to our common stock  may cause a change in control if a substantial number of our shares of common stock are issued  which may affect  among other things  our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards  if any  and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors  and may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock 
in addition  we may incur substantial debt to complete another business combination 
the incurrence of debt could result in default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after a business combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations  our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest  if any  if the debt security is payable on demand  and our inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt security instrument covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt instrument is outstanding 
we are subject to laws and governmental regulations and actions that affect our operating results and financial condition 
our business is subject to regulation and taxation under a wide variety of foreign and us federal  state and local laws  regulations and policies including those imposed by the securities and exchange commission  the internal revenue service  the i 
table of contents sarbanes oxley act of  the dodd frank wall street reform and nasdaq  as well as applicable labor laws 
although we have policies and procedures designed to comply with applicable laws and regulations  failure to comply with the various laws and regulations may result in civil and criminal liability  fines and penalties  increased costs of compliance  additional taxation and restatement of our financial statements 
there can also be no assurance that  in response to current economic conditions or the current political environment or otherwise  laws and regulations will not be implemented or changed in ways that adversely affect our operating results and financial condition  such as recently adopted legislation that expands health care coverage costs  or facilitates union activity or federal legislative proposals to otherwise increase taxation and operating costs 
we are exposed to various possible claims relating to our business and our insurance may not fully protect us 
we are exposed to various possible claims relating to our business 
these possible claims include those relating to i personal injury or death caused by container products  mobile offices or modular units leased or sold by us  ii accidents involving our vehicles and our employees  iii employment related claims  iv property damage and v commercial claims 
we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for the protection of our assets and operations 
however  our insurance may not fully protect us for certain types of claims  such as claims for punitive damages or for damages arising from intentional misconduct  which are often alleged in third party lawsuits 
in addition  we may be exposed to uninsured liability at levels in excess of our policy limits 
if we are found liable for any significant claims that are not covered by insurance  our liquidity and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
it is possible that our insurance carrier may disclaim coverage for any class action and derivative lawsuits against us 
it is also possible that some or all of the insurance that is currently available to us will not be available in the future on economically reasonable terms or not available at all 
in addition  whether we are covered by insurance or not  certain claims may have the potential for negative publicity surrounding such claims  which may adversely impact our operating results  value of our public securities  or give rise to additional similar claims being filed 
disruptions in our information technology systems could limit our ability to effectively monitor and control our operations and adversely affect our operations 
our information technology systems facilitate our ability to monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions 
any disruption in our information technology systems or the failure of these systems to operate as expected could  depending on the magnitude of the problem  adversely affect our operating results by limiting our capacity to effectively transact business  monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions in a timely manner 
the delay or failure to implement information system upgrades and new systems effectively could disrupt our business  distract management s focus and attention from our business operations and growth initiatives  and increase our implementation and operating costs  any of which could negatively impact our operations and operating results 
the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly  which may make it difficult for stockholders to resell common stock when they want or at a price they find attractive 
we expect that the market price of our common stock will fluctuate 
our common stock price can fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results  changes in interest rates and other general economic conditions  significant acquisitions or business combinations  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving us or our competitors  operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us  news reports relating to trends  concerns  litigation  regulatory changes and other issues in our industry  geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts  relatively low trading volume  and significant concentration of ownership in our common stock 
i 
table of contents if equity research analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock  the price of our common stock could decline 
the trading market for our common stock will rely in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business 
we do not control these analysts 
the price of our stock could decline if one or more equity analysts downgrade our stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business 
we do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock  which may limit the return on your investment in us 
except for payment of dividends on our preferred stock and on the capital stock of royal wolf  we intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
our outstanding options and warrants may have an adverse effect on the market price of common stock and increase the difficulty of effecting future business combinations 
at june   we had outstanding options and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
the potential for the issuance of substantial numbers of additional shares of common stock upon exercise of these warrants and options could make us a less attractive acquisition vehicle in the eyes of a target business 
such securities  when exercised  will increase the number of issued and outstanding shares of our common stock and reduce the value of the shares issued 
additionally  the sale  or even the possibility of sale  of the shares underlying the warrants and options could have an adverse effect on the market price for our securities or on our ability to obtain future financing 
unionization by some or all of our employees could cause increases in operating costs 
our employees are not presently covered by collective bargaining agreements 
unions may attempt to organize our employees in the future 
we are unable to predict the outcome of any continuing or future efforts to organize our employees  the terms of any future labor agreements  or the effect  if any  those agreements might have on our operations or financial performance 
significant risks related primarily to our operations in the asia pacific area the future performance of royal wolf depends on customer demand for portable container solutions as well as the expansion of the portable container solutions products market in australia 
any reduction in customer demand  failure of customer demand to grow  or failure of royal wolf to meet changes in customer demand or preferences may adversely affect royal wolf s businesses  operational performance  growth prospects and financial position 
royal wolf is also subject to demand fluctuations in key markets such as resources  construction  manufacturing  and retail 
the success and ability to drive future growth is dependent to a large extent on brand reputation 
royal wolf believes its brand reputation is a key driver in its success and its ability to drive future growth 
any adverse change to the reputation of royal wolf may adversely affect the company s businesses  operational performance and financial condition 
royal wolf owns the trademark and license for the name royal wolf in australia  new zealand and surrounding islands in the asia pacific region 
there is a risk that use of the royal wolf brand by third parties in jurisdictions in which royal wolf does not own the trademark may adversely impact the royal wolf brand 
royal wolf s ability to achieve its long term business strategy is dependent to a certain extent on its supply chain and purchasing 
royal wolf s long term business strategy assumes a certain level of growth in australian and new zealand demand for container based solutions 
royal wolf s ability to meet this demand is dependent  to a certain extent  on the ability of royal wolf to purchase storage containers economically and on an on time basis 
historically  royal wolf has successfully worked with shipping lines and international container leasing companies to purchase used containers  and with manufacturers and brokers  including in china  to purchase new containers  but there can be no guarantee of this in the future 
changes to shipping line practices with respect to used containers  and adverse changes in trade practices  regulations and relations between australia and its trading partners  including china  could adversely impact royal wolf s ability to purchase containers or impact the price at which royal wolf is able to purchase containers 
historically  royal wolf has relied on internal supply chain and sourcing arrangements  international suppliers and the logistics industry to relocate containers 
changes to these arrangements  constraints on the supply chain  failure of suppliers to deliver or i 
table of contents deliver in a timely manner  or material increases in the price of new or used containers could have an adverse impact on royal wolf s business  operational performance  profit margins and financial results 
royal wolf s expansion plans involve an element of risk and could strain management resources 
royal wolf intends to pursue a growth strategy involving organic and non organic growth 
there is a no guarantee that such growth will occur or be successful 
royal wolf may incur significant capital expenditure in connection with expansion plans that may not be realized or may not deliver the earnings that are expected 
in addition  royal wolf s expansion plans may  in the future  give rise to risks or problems  including the diversion of management s attention and resources  which may have a materially adverse impact on the performance of royal wolf 
limitations on royal wolf s growth and expansion  or materially adverse changes arising from expansion plans  may affect the operating and financial performance of royal wolf 
failure to retain key personnel could adversely affect royal wolf s ability to execute its business strategy 
the successful operation and growth of royal wolf depends  to a significant extent  upon the performance and expertise of key staff and royal wolf s ability to attract and retain skilled employees 
changes that adversely affect royal wolf s ability to attract and retain skilled employees could materially impact royal wolf s business  operational performance and financial results 
additionally  royal wolf does not maintain key person insurance  and as such may be adversely impacted by the departure of key staff 
royal wolf conducts its business in a highly competitive sector 
royal wolf s faces competition in the portable buildings  freight and portable storage markets 
royal wolf also faces potentially significant competition from modular industry companies who have non container portable building offerings  especially from several national competitors in australia who have greater financial resources and pricing flexibility than royal wolf 
as a result  royal wolf is subject to potential entry by new domestic and foreign competitors and the provision of new products or services  aggressive pricing and lease rates offered by existing competitors 
royal wolf may not always be able to match its competitors in service levels  functionality and price 
the emergence of a new competitor with international reach  or increased focus on the rental model by existing competitors  particularly with an extensive distribution network  could have an adverse effect on royal wolf s business  financial condition  results of operations and growth prospects 
also  continued service improvement by competitors may result in royal wolf s customers using substitutes in place of some of royal wolf s products 
royal wolf may not always be able to match its competitors in both functionality and price  which could negatively impact royal wolf s revenues 
in addition  some of royal wolf s unique products are the subject of patent applications only and there is no guarantee that those applications will become effective 
if the patent applications do not become effective  there is a risk that royal wolf s competitors could produce similar rival products  which may have an adverse effect on royal wolf 
royal wolf is subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
royal wolf is subject to exchange rate fluctuations  particularly as it sources a substantial portion of its portable container solutions fleet from china in purchases  which are us dollar denominated 
while royal wolf has a hedging policy to mitigate this risk  unhedged exchange rate fluctuations in the australian dollar relative to the us dollar and  to a lesser extent  the new zealand dollar  may adversely affect the financial performance of royal wolf  including its financial position  cash flows  distributions  growth prospects  and share price royal wolf is subject to australian and new zealand taxation and tariff regulation 
significant recent reforms and current proposals for further reforms to tax laws in the jurisdictions within which royal wolf operates may give rise to uncertainty 
the precise scope and impact of future changes to tax laws may not be known 
royal wolf is also subject to import tariffs with respect to the portable container products it sources from overseas 
any changes to such tax or tariff laws including the imposition of  or increases to  such taxes or tariffs  their interpretation or the manner in which they are administered by the relevant government agency or the current rate of company income tax or import tariff may impact the operational or financial performance of royal wolf or customers in its key end markets 
royal wolf may face a tightening labor force and is subject to occupational health and safety regulations 
royal wolf s ability to remain productive  profitable and competitive and to effect its planned growth initiatives depends on its ability to attract and retain workers 
tightening of the labor market in key regions due to a shortage of suitably skilled workers may inhibit royal wolf s ability to hire and retain employees 
additionally  rising wages paid to employees may pose a risk to royal wolf s margins if it is unable to pass on such higher costs through price increases 
i 
table of contents royal wolf is also subject to occupational health and safety regulations 
if royal wolf is not able to maintain its working conditions to meet occupational health and safety regulations it may impact royal wolf s operations and ability to attract and retain workers and also result in contravention of those regulations  which may give rise to potential criminal and civil liability and also damage royal wolf s brand and reputation 
significant risks related primarily to our business and operations in north america general or localized economic downturns or weakness may adversely affect pac van s customers  in particular those in the construction industry  which may reduce demand for pac van s products and services and negatively impact our future revenues and results of operations 
a significant portion of pac van s revenues is derived from customers who are in industries and businesses that are cyclical in nature and subject to changes in general economic conditions  including the construction industry  which constituted over of pac van s revenues for the fiscal year ended june  although the variety of pac van s products  the breadth of its customer base and the number of markets it serves throughout the united states limit its exposure to economic downturns  general economic downturns or localized downturns in markets where its operates could reduce demand for pac van s products  especially in the construction industry  and negatively impact our future revenues and results of operations 
pac van faces significant competition in the modular buildings and portable storage industries 
pac van also faces potentially significant competition from modular buildings companies who have portable storage product offerings  especially from several national competitors in the united states who have greater financial resources and pricing flexibility than pac van does 
if pac van is unable to compete successfully  it could lose customers and our future revenues could decline 
although pac van s competition varies significantly by market  the modular buildings markets in which pac van competes are dominated by two large participants and are highly competitive 
in addition  pac van competes with a number of large to mid sized regional competitors  as well as many smaller  full and part time operators in many local regions 
the modular building industry is highly competitive  subject to stiff pricing competition and almost all of the competitors have portable storage product offerings 
the primary modular national competitors with portable storage product offerings are less leveraged than pac van  and have greater financial resources and pricing flexibility than pac van does 
if they focus on portable storage  pac van could lose customers and our future revenues could decline 
if pac van is unable to compete successfully  it could lose customers and our future revenues could decline 
because pac van has depended to a large extent on the success of its leasing operations  the failure of pac van to effectively and quickly remarket lease units that are returned could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
historically  pac van s average monthly lease fleet utilization has averaged between and  with the typical lease term being for an average period of over twelve months 
the high utilization rate and the length of the average lease have provided pac van with a predictable revenue stream 
however  if utilization rates decline or should a significant number of pac van s lease units be returned during any short period of time  pac van would have to re lease a large supply of units at similar rates to maintain historic revenues from these operations 
pac van s failure to effectively maintain historical utilization rates or remarket a large influx of units returning from leases could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
sales of modular buildings  mobile offices and container product units constitute a significant portion of pac van s revenues and the failure to continue to sell units at historic rates could adversely affect our ability to grow pac van s lease fleet 
revenues from sales of modular buildings  mobile offices and container products have been used to fund increases in the size of our lease fleet 
as a result  the failure to continue to sell a significant number of units may adversely affect our ability to increase the size of pac van s lease fleet or to otherwise take advantage of business and growth opportunities available to it 
we may be brought into tort or environmental litigation or held responsible for cleanup of spills if the customer fails to perform  or an accident occurs in the use of our tank container products  which could materially adversely affect our business  future operating results or financial position 
our portable liquid tank containers are used by our customers to store non hazardous and certain hazardous liquids on the customer s site 
our customers are responsible for proper operation of our fleet equipment while on lease and returning a cleaned and undamaged container upon completion of use  but we cannot always assure that these responsibilities are fully met in all cases 
in addition  if an accident were to occur involving our lease equipment or a spill of substances were to occur when in transport or on lease with our customer  a claim could be made against us as owner of the lease equipment 
i 
table of contents in the event of a spill or accident  we may be brought into a lawsuit or enforcement action by either our customer or a third party on numerous potential grounds  including that an inherent flaw in a container tank contributed to the accident or that the container tank had suffered some undiscovered harm from a previous customer s prior use 
in the event of a spill caused by our customers  we may be held responsible for cleanup under environmental laws and regulations concerning obligations of suppliers of rental products to effect remediation 
in addition  applicable environmental laws and regulations may impose liability on us for conduct of third parties  or for actions that complied with applicable regulations when taken  regardless of negligence or fault 
substantial damage awards have also been made in certain jurisdictions against lessors of industrial equipment based upon claims of personal injury  property damage  and resource damage caused by the use of various products 
while we try to take reasonable precautions that our lease equipment is in good and safe condition prior to lease and carry insurance to protect against certain risks of loss or accidents  liability could adversely impact our profitability 
the portable liquid containment rental industry is highly competitive  and competitive pressures could impair or ability to increase market share and to rent  or sell  equipment at favorable prices 
the portable liquid containment industry is highly competitive 
we compete against national  regional and local companies  some of which are significantly larger than we are and both of which have greater financial and marketing resources than we have 
some of our competitors also have longer operating histories  lower cost basis of rental equipment  lower cost structures and more established relationships with equipment manufacturers than we have 
in addition  certain of our competitors are more geographically diverse than we are and have greater name recognition among customers than we do 
as a result  our competitors that have these advantages may be better able to attract customers 
we believe that local relationships  equipment quality  service levels and fleet size are key competitive factors in the portable liquid containment industry 
from time to time  we or our competitors may attempt to compete aggressively by lowering rental rates or prices 
competitive pressures could adversely affect our future revenues and operating results by depressing the rental rates 
to the extent we lower lease rates or increase our fleet in order to retain or increase market share  our operating margins would be adversely impacted 
in addition  we may not be able to match a larger competitor s price reductions or fleet investment because of its greater financial resources  all of which could adversely impact our future operating results 
changes in regulatory  or governmental  oversight of hydraulic fracturing could materially adversely affect the demand for our portable liquid containment products 
we believe that in recent years growing demand related to hydraulic fracturing has increased and we have made a conscientious decision to enter into this market 
however  oil and gas exploration and extraction including use of tanks for hydraulic fracturing of gas and oil shale are subject to numerous local  state and federal regulations 
the hydraulic fracturing method of extraction has come under scrutiny in several states and by the federal government due to the potential adverse effects that hydraulic fracturing  and the liquids and chemicals used  may have on water quality and public health 
in addition  the disposal of wastewater from the hydraulic fracturing process into injection wells may increase the rate of seismic activity near drill sites and could result in regulatory changes  delays or interruption of future activity 
changes in these regulations could limit  interrupt  or stop exploration and extraction activities  which would negatively impact the demand for our portable liquid containment products 
seasonality of the portable liquid containment industry may impact future quarterly results 
activity may decline in our second quarter month of december and our third quarter months of january and february 
these months may have lower rental activity in parts of the country where inclement weather may delay  or suspend  a company s project 
the impact of these delays may be to decrease the number of frac tank containers on lease until companies are able to resume their projects when weather improves 
these seasonal factors may impact our future quarterly results in each year s second and third quarters 
significant increases in raw material costs could increase our operating costs significantly and harm our future results of operations 
pac van purchases raw materials  including metals  lumber  siding and roofing and other products  to construct and modify modular buildings and to modify containers to its customers requirements 
pac van also maintains a truck fleet to deliver units to and return units from customers 
during periods of rising prices for raw materials  especially oil and fuel for delivery vehicles  and in particular when the prices increase rapidly or to levels significantly higher than normal  pac van may incur significant increases in operating costs and may not be able to pass price increases through to customers in a timely manner  which could harm our future results of operations 
i 
table of contents failure to retain key personnel could adversely affect pac van s operations and could impede our ability to execute our business plan and growth strategy 
pac van is managed largely by seven key senior managers 
the continued success of pac van will depend largely on the efforts and abilities of these senior managers 
these officers and employees have an understanding of pac van and its industry that cannot be readily duplicated 
in addition  we do not have key man insurance 
the loss of any member of pac van s senior management team could impair our ability to execute our business plan and growth strategy  cause a loss of customers  reduce revenues and adversely affect employee morale 
failure by pac van s manufacturers to sell and deliver products to pac van in timely fashion may harm pac van s reputation and our financial condition 
pac van currently purchases new modular buildings and components  mobile offices and container products directly from manufacturers 
although pac van is not dependent on any one manufacturer and is able to purchase products from a variety of suppliers  the failure of one or more of its suppliers to timely manufacture and deliver storage containers to pac van could adversely affect its operations 
pac van purchases new modular buildings and components  mobile offices and storage containers under purchase orders issued to various manufacturers  which the manufacturers may or may not accept or be able to fill 
pac van has no contracts with any supplier 
if these suppliers do not timely fill pac van s purchase orders  or do not properly manufacture the ordered products  our reputation and financial condition also could be harmed 
some zoning laws restrict the use of pac van s storage units and therefore limit its ability to offer its products in all markets 
many of pac van s customers use pac van s storage units to store goods on their own properties 
local zoning laws in some of pac van s markets prohibit customers from maintaining mobile offices or storage containers on their properties or require that mobile offices or storage containers be located out of sight from the street 
if local zoning laws in one or more of pac van s geographic markets were to ban or restrict its products from being stored on customers sites  pac van s business in that market could suffer 
developments in california may have an adverse impact on our business and financial results 
we are headquartered and have operations in california  which like many other state and local jurisdictions is facing severe budgetary problems and deficits 
action that may be taken in response to these problems  such as increases in property taxes  changes to sales taxes  adoption of a proposed business net receipts tax or other governmental efforts to raise revenues could adversely impact our business and results of operations
