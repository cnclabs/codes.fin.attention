item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors including those set forth under the heading risk factors elsewhere in this report 
general we are a molecular diagnostics company that operates primarily in the field of genetic analysis and molecular diagnostics through our wholly owned subsidiary  combimatrix molecular diagnostics  inc cmdx  located in irvine  california 
cmdx operates as a diagnostics reference laboratory providing dna based clinical diagnostic testing services to physicians  hospitals  clinics and other laboratories in two primary areas i prenatal and postnatal developmental disorders  and ii hematology oncology genomics 
cmdx provides its services through the use of array comparative genomic hybridization acgh  which enables the analysis of genetic anomalies 
our mission is to empower physicians to positively impact patient care through the delivery of innovative molecular diagnostics services 
prior to  we were primarily focused on developing proprietary dna array based tools and instruments for the genetic research community  under the brand formerly known as customarray  as well as providing molecular diagnostics services through cmdx 
on april   we announced a strategic and operational restructuring plan the restructuring plan intended to significantly reduce operating costs  increase the focus on our diagnostic services business and transition senior management 
as part of the restructuring plan  we closed our customarray business and facilities located in mukilteo  washington and relocated our corporate headquarters to irvine  california 
since the restructuring  our primary focus has been on our diagnostics services business 
our goals include increasing utilization of our existing tests  expanding our diagnostic test menu  increasing and diversifying our client base  and improving reimbursement for our testing services 
as a result of executing the restructuring plan  the financial results of our customarray business have been classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations 
unless otherwise noted  amounts and disclosures throughout this report relate to our continuing operations 
liquidity at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
as a result  we anticipate that our cash and cash equivalent balances  anticipated cash flows from operations and anticipated operating cash savings from our restructuring plan will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements into the fourth quarter of in order for us to continue as a going concern beyond this point and ultimately 
table of contents to achieve profitability  we may be required to obtain capital from external sources  increase revenues and reduce operating costs 
however  there can be no assurances that our operations will become profitable or that external sources of financing  including the issuance of debt and or equity securities  will be available at times and at terms acceptable to us  or at all 
the issuance of additional equity or convertible debt securities will also cause dilution to our shareholders 
if external financing sources are not available or are inadequate to fund our operations  we will be required to reduce operating costs  including research projects and personnel  which could jeopardize our future strategic initiatives and business plans 
see the liquidity and capital resources section below as well as note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional discussion of these matters 
overview of recent business activities during  our business activities were driven primarily by commercialization efforts for our suite of molecular diagnostic tests  expansion of our test menu and of our leadership team 
in april  we announced an expanded relationship with clarient to commercialize our dnarray tm product portfolio in the area of solid tumor and blood based cancers 
in september  we added jeff hayes as director of sales for our oncology business and also appointed david h 
ledbetter to our medical advisory board 
we also completed a private placement transaction the private placement with certain accredited investors in which we sold million of newly issued shares of our common stock and common stock purchase warrants 
under the terms of the private placement  we sold million units for per unit 
each unit consisted of one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the private placement was led by hlm venture partners iii  lp hlm  who added martin felsenthal  a partner with hlm  to our board of directors 
as a result of increased commercial focus  total diagnostic services revenue increased by to million in as compared to million in critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in preparing these financial statements  we make assumptions  judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in our financial statements 
we base our assumptions  judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on a regular basis we evaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly 
we believe that  of the significant accounting policies discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  the following accounting policies require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments revenue recognition and estimates for contractual allowances  accounting for stock based compensation  fair value measurements  and accounting for income taxes 
we discuss below the critical accounting assumptions  judgments and estimates associated with these policies 
historically  our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results 
for further information on our critical accounting policies  refer to note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

table of contents revenue recognition as described below  significant management judgments must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue recognized or deferred for any period if management made different judgments 
in general  we recognize revenue when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services have been performed  iii amounts are fixed or determinable and iv collectability of amounts is reasonably assured 
service revenues from providing diagnostic tests are recognized when the testing process is complete and test results are reported to the ordering physician or clinic 
these diagnostic services are billed to various payors  including commercial insurance companies  healthcare institutions  individuals and government payors including medicare and medicaid 
we report revenues from contracted payors based on a contractual rate  or in the case of medicare and medicaid  published fee schedules for our tests 
we report revenues from non contracted payors based on the amount expected to be collected 
the difference between the amount billed and the amount expected to be collected from non contracted payors is recorded as a contractual allowance to arrive at net recognized revenues 
the expected revenues from non contracted payors are based on the historical collection experience of each payor or payor group  as appropriate 
in each reporting period  we review our historical collection experience for non contracted payors and adjust our expected revenues for current and subsequent periods accordingly 
we also recognize additional revenue from actual cash payments that exceed amounts initially recognized  in the period the payments are received 
because a substantial portion of our revenues is from non contracted third party payors  it is likely that we will be required to make positive or negative adjustments to accounting estimates with respect to contractual allowances in the future  which may positively or adversely affect our results of operations 
in all cases described above  we report revenues net of any applicable statutory taxes collected from customers  as applicable 
during  revenues from the sale of acgh slides  including shipping and handling fees but excluding statutory taxes collected from customers  as applicable  have been recognized when delivery occurred 
there is no written or implied right to return or exchange the products 
we ceased selling acgh slides during the fourth quarter of revenues from multiple element arrangements are based on the relative selling price method  whereby we allocate consideration received to all deliverables of an arrangement at the inception of the arrangement based on the relative selling prices of each element 
in order to determine the selling price of a deliverable  we apply the following hierarchy vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  third party evidence if vsoe is not available  and our best estimate of selling price for the deliverable if neither vsoe nor third party evidence is available 
several factors are considered when determining the estimated selling price of a deliverable  including  but not limited to  the cost to produce the deliverable  the expected margin on that deliverable  our ongoing pricing strategy and policies and the value added components of differentiated deliverables  if determinable 
in order for a deliverable to be accounted for as a separate unit of accounting  the delivered item or items must have value to the customer on a standalone basis 
accounting for stock based compensation the compensation cost for all stock based awards is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense  on a straight line basis  over the employee s requisite service period generally the vesting period of the equity award which is generally three to four years 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a black scholes option valuation model 
stock based compensation expense is recognized only for those awards that are expected to vest using an estimated forfeiture rate 
we estimate pre vesting option forfeitures at the time of grant and reflect the impact of estimated pre vesting option forfeitures in compensation expense recognized 

table of contents fair value measurements we measure fair value as an exit price  representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
as such  fair value is a market based measurement that is determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability 
we utilize a three tier fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level observable market inputs such as quoted prices in active markets  level observable market inputs  other than the quoted prices in active markets  that are observable either directly or indirectly  and level unobservable inputs where there is little or no market data  which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions accounting for income taxes we recognize income taxes on an accrual basis based on tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns 
a tax position is defined as a position in a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax filing that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
tax positions are recognized only when it is more likely than not ie  likelihood of greater than  based on technical merits  that the position would be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold are measured using a probability weighted approach as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement 
income taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets if all  or some portion  of such assets will more than likely not be realized 
should they occur  our policy is to classify interest and penalties related to tax positions as income tax expense 
since our inception  no such interest or penalties have been incurred  however 
comparison of the results of operations revenues and cost of revenues dollars in thousands for the years ended december  change services cost of services products cost of products services revenues 
services revenues are generated from providing dna based genomic testing services in the areas of prenatal and postnatal development disorders in children and  to a lesser extent  in oncology 
services revenues increased primarily due to volume increases of our genomic tests 
billable test volumes were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in volumes was due primarily to expansion of our sales force and from increased focus on sales and marketing efforts during compared to our average revenue per test decreased slightly from  in to in this decrease was due primarily to a change in mix of tests performed for customers with governmental third party insurance coverage including medicare and various state medicaid programs  which tend to have lower reimbursement per test than do commercial insurance or direct bill customers  as well as from the introduction of additional cytogenetic tests that are reimbursed at lower rates than our array based test offerings 
services revenues also includes adjustments relating to our 
table of contents revenue recognition policy of periodically adjusting our estimate for contractual allowances for revenues from non contracted payors as well as from receiving cash payments in excess of amounts previously recognized for service revenues 
for the years ended december  and  net positive revenue adjustments were  and  respectively 
products revenues 
product revenues have historically been generated exclusively from selling bacterial artificial chromosome  or bac  cgh arrays and related reagents to a single distributor located in taiwan 
during the third quarter of  we were notified by our distributor that its customers were considering other bac cgh array providers and as a result  it was likely that our revenues from product sales would decrease in future periods 
as a result  we did not sell any bac arrays during and do not expect to sell such arrays in the future 
cost of products and services revenues 
cost of products and services include direct materials such as array and laboratory costs  direct laboratory labor wages and benefits  allocation of overhead and stock compensation expenses 
these costs increased in as compared to due primarily to volume increases 
cost of services included  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  of non cash stock compensation expense 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a detailed description of the amounts of non cash stock compensation expense recognized for the periods presented 
operating expenses dollars in thousands for the years ended december  change research and development sales and marketing general and administrative goodwill impairment research and development 
these expenses include labor and laboratory supply costs associated with investigating new tests  but primarily consist of development costs to maintain and improve our existing suite of diagnostic tests offered 
prior to launching a new test or modifying an existing test  appropriate clinical trials and extensive laboratory validations  consistent with the various regulations that govern our industry  must be performed 
these costs are classified as research and development for all periods presented 
the decrease in research and development expenses for all periods presented was due primarily to greater allocation of laboratory resources on production and commercial efforts during as compared to in addition  research and development expenses include non cash stock compensation charges  which were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in stock compensation charges was due primarily to prior stock option awards to our employees which became fully vested late in and during see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a detailed description of the amounts of non cash stock compensation expense recognized for the periods presented 
sales and marketing 
these expenses include salaries and wages associated with our sales force and marketing resources  sales commissions and other expenses associated with promotional and advertising efforts 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses was due to greater emphasis during on our sales and marketing efforts  hiring of additional sales representatives and increased marketing costs in order to expand and increase market awareness and penetration of our suite of molecular diagnostic tests 
in addition  sales and marketing expenses include non cash stock compensation charges  which were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in stock compensation charges was due primarily to prior stock option awards to our employees which became fully vested late in and during see note to our consolidated financial statements included 
table of contents elsewhere in this report for a detailed description of the amounts of non cash stock compensation expense recognized for the periods presented 
general and administrative 
these expenses include compensation and benefit costs of our administrative staff  information technology  executive management  human resources and accounting personnel  as well as facilities related costs  insurance  legal  audit and other professional services 
also included in general and administrative expenses are non cash stock based compensation expenses  which were  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in stock compensation charges was due primarily to prior stock option awards to our employees which became fully vested late in and during see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a detailed description of the amounts of non cash stock compensation expense recognized for the periods presented 
excluding charges associated with non cash stock compensation  general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended december  by  as compared to the increase was driven primarily by increased bad debt expense  increased legal costs and increased consulting charges as compared to goodwill impairment 
the decline in our market capitalization during the second quarter of as indicated by the trading price of our common stock on the nasdaq stock market was considered by management to be a potential goodwill impairment triggering event 
as a result  we performed a business valuation using a market based approach and determined that all of our million in goodwill was impaired 
other non operating items dollars in thousands for the years ended december  change qualified therapeutic discovery program income litigation settlement gain loss from early extinguishment of debt interest expense derivatives gains qualified therapeutic discovery program income 
we were awarded  in under the internal revenue service s section d for qualifying therapeutic discovery projects 
earlier in  we submitted two grant proposals under this program and were notified that our applications were accepted and the related funds were paid  during the fourth quarter of no such activity occurred during also  since this program was non recurring in nature  we elected to classify the payments as other income for the period presented 
litigation settlement gain 
in february  we received gross proceeds of million from entering into a settlement agreement with national union fire insurance company of pittsburgh  pa 
contingent attorneys costs and expenses relating to the settlement were million 
thus  the net amount of the settlement gain recognized was million during the year ended december  there were no such events in loss from early extinguishment of debt 
in march  we fully retired our secured convertible debenture the debenture 
as a result  the remaining  unamortized debt discount of  was written off as a non operating loss from early extinguishment of debt in the year ended december  there were no such events in interest expense 
through march of  interest expense was primarily comprised of interest charges associated with the debenture  which accrued interest at an annual rate of on the outstanding 
table of contents principal balance 
interest expense also included amortization of the million of debt discount originally recognized from issuance of the debenture and related warrants using the effective interest method 
as a result of retiring the debenture in march  interest expense had decreased and is primarily comprised of interest charges are from certain capital leases for laboratory equipment 
derivative gains 
these gains represent the net gain or expense recognized from mark to model adjustments to the embedded derivatives associated with the debenture that were outstanding prior to retirement of the debenture in march as a result  the remaining derivatives liability of  was written off as a non operating gain 
there were no such activities in discontinued operations dollars in thousands for the years ended december  change income loss from discontinued operations on april   we announced a restructuring plan intended to focus our company on our diagnostic services business while shutting down our customarray business 
related restructuring and asset impairment charges were million  net of surplus sales of property and equipment  for the year ended december  the operations of our former customarray business have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
although most of the staff and operations were shut down during  work on certain government contracts continued until early  resulting in final billings on those contracts during the first and second quarters of as a result  we recognized income from discontinued operations of  during as compared to a loss of million during  which includes a full year s worth of customarray operations as well as million in restructuring and impairment charges that were not repeated in during  all remaining contracts were completed and as a result  we do not expect to incur income or losses from discontinued operations in the future 
inflation inflation has not had a significant impact in the current or prior periods 
liquidity and capital resources at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled million  compared to million at december  cash is held primarily in general checking accounts as well as in money market mutual funds backed by us government securities 
working capital was million at december  and  respectively 
the net change in cash and cash equivalents for the periods presented was comprised of the following in thousands for the years ended december  change net cash used in provided by operating activities investing activities financing activities decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents operating activities 
the overall net decrease in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to the net litigation settlement proceeds from national union of million received in february  which were not repeated in excluding the impact of this one time event  cash flows 
table of contents from operating activities improved by million due primarily to reduced operating cash burn from shutting down the customarray business unit in as part of the restructuring plan 
investing activities 
the increase in net cash flows used in investing activities was due to increased capital expenditures for laboratory and it related equipment to support our diagnostics business 
financing activities 
the increase in net cash flows from financing activities was due primarily to the million of net proceeds received from the private placement during the second quarter of  as compared to the million repayment of the debenture in the first quarter of future liquidity 
we have a history of incurring net losses and net operating cash flow deficits 
we are also deploying new technologies and continue to develop commercial products and services 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalent balances will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements into the fourth quarter of in order for us to continue as a going concern beyond this point and ultimately to achieve profitability  we may be required to obtain capital from external sources  increase revenues and reduce operating costs 
however  there can be no assurance that our operations will become profitable or that external sources of financing  including the issuance of debt and or equity securities  will be available at times and at terms acceptable to us  or at all 
the issuance of additional equity or convertible debt securities will also cause dilution to our shareholders 
if external financing sources are not available or are inadequate to fund our operations  we will be required to reduce operating costs  including research projects and personnel  which could jeopardize our future strategic initiatives and business plans 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional discussion of these matters 
capital requirements 
we may also encounter unforeseen difficulties that may deplete our capital resources more rapidly than anticipated 
any efforts to seek additional funding could be made through equity  debt or other external financing  and there can be no assurance that additional funding will be available on favorable terms  in a timely manner or at all 
our long term capital requirements will be substantial and the adequacy of available funds will depend upon many factors  including the costs of commercialization activities  including sales and marketing  manufacturing and capital equipment  competing technological developments  the creation and formation of strategic partnerships  the costs associated with leasing and improving our irvine  california facility  and other factors that may not be within our control 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of regulation s k promulgated by the sec 
however  we have entered into an operating lease for our laboratory space and corporate offices  totaling approximately  square feet 
we have no significant commitments for capital expenditures in or beyond 
we have executed eight capital leases totaling  for certain laboratory equipment
