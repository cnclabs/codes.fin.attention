item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this item should be read in the context of the information included elsewhere in this annual report including our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in item of this annual report 
overview we are organized along product categories and have two reportable segments accessories  which include belts  small leather goods and bags  and gifts 
during fiscal we focused on improving the bottom line by replacing net sales from unprofitable product categories with net sales and profitable growth in our gifts business and through acquiring new licenses 
in fiscal we signed six new licenses sperry top sider  elie tahari  eddie bauer expanded to include belts and small leather goods  miss me  the sharper image and arnold palmer 
we expect our fiscal initiatives to provide meaningful growth in net sales and profitability in fiscal our operating results for fiscal were impacted by significant net sales growth in our gifts segment up  lower net sales in our accessories segment primarily as a result of our june restructuring plan in which we exited under performing  non core product categories  higher freight and material costs in our gifts segment  an unexpected bad debt provision  and significant improvements in our operating expenses as a result of the execution of our cost savings initiatives which reduced sg a expenses by over the past two fiscal years 
for the year  we had a net loss of million  or per share  a million improvement over the prior year 
the following table presents sales and gross margin data for our business segments in thousands of dollars 
other financial information about our segments is incorporated herein by reference to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
net sales accessories gifts gross margin accessories gifts gross margin percent of sales accessories gifts operating expenses accessories gifts the following presents selling  general and administrative expenses sg a  depreciation and amortization  and our interest expenses which are not directly allocated to one of our segments in thousands of dollars selling  general and administrative expenses unallocated restructuring charges acquisition related costs depreciation and amortization interest expense our sales are generally affected by changes in demand for our product categories volume as well as customer allowances and returns 
sales volume also can impact our gross margins in terms of product channel mix between mass merchant retailers  which typically sell product at lower price points than department stores  and specialty retailers 
the components of our cost of goods sold and sg a are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report and incorporated herein by reference 
we include the costs related to our distribution network in sg a while others may include all or a portion of such costs in their cost of goods sold 
consequently  our gross margins may not be comparable to others 
the following table presents net sales for each of our product categories in thousands of dollars net sales of total net sales of total belts gifts small leather goods other operationally  our most significant accomplishments in fiscal were organically grew our gifts product category  reduced sg a expenses as net sales declined from the prior year  consolidated certain facilities to simplify operations and reduce selling  general and administrative expenses  executed an amendment to extend our totes license for an additional four years  executed six licensing agreements with national brands sperry top sider  elie tahari  eddie bauer  miss me  the sharper image and arnold palmer  and entered into a four year  million credit facility  which we believe will provide adequate liquidity for the foreseeable future 
compared to net sales and gross margins our fiscal net sales were million  which was million  or lower than the prior year 
our fiscal gross margin of increased basis points from the prior year 
net sales for the accessories segment were million  which was million  or  lower than the prior year primarily due to lower sales from exiting certain product categories million  lower levels of replenishment orders by our largest customer in the first half of the fiscal year and non repeat of new men s belt assortments that shipped to a major customer in the prior period from additional retail space procured 
gifts segment net sales of million in fiscal were million  or  greater than in the prior year primarily due to increased holiday shipments resulting from organic growth of our totes license and new sales under our eddie bauer and the sharper image licenses 
accessories segment gross margins increased from in fiscal to in fiscal primarily because of the million inventory write off associated with our discontinued product lines in the prior year 
the remaining increase was driven by improvements in sales mix due to exiting product categories  lower inventory write offs and lower customer deductions 
the gifts segment margin was basis points lower in fiscal compared to the prior year due to a higher mix of customer direct shipments in the current year period  higher freight and materials costs and higher sales mix to our higher volume  lower margin customers 
customer direct shipments carry lower gross margins because these goods are shipped from our suppliers to our customers and are not handled in our distribution centers  reducing the associated selling  general and administrative costs 
operating expenses total segment operating expenses in fiscal of million were million lower than the prior year million primarily due to decreases in variable distribution labor  facilities and advertising costs 
total sg a expenses of million for fiscal were million  or  lower than fiscal million 
the reductions were primarily due to decreases in variable distribution labor and compensation costs  facilities costs  and advertising and professional services  offset partially by increases in bad debt provisions  investment in new licenses  and facilities consolidation charges 
depreciation and amortization for fiscal was  lower than in as a result of assets being fully depreciated during the current year 
interest and taxes interest expense for fiscal was  higher than that incurred in the increase was primarily due to a  write off of costs capitalized in connection with our previous credit facility and interest incurred from the early payment program with our lender and largest customer 
this increase was offset partially by savings from lower outstanding borrowings during the current year 
we have a federal income tax net loss carryover of million that will expire beginning in our effective income tax rates were and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
in both years  the benefits of the federal statutory rate applied to our pretax losses were offset by deferred tax valuation allowances fiscal  fiscal 
the valuation allowances are recorded on our federal and state deferred tax assets because we have experienced cumulative operating losses over the past few years 
realization of the deferred tax assets and reversal of associated valuation allowances is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences become deductible 
liquidity and capital resources we generally expect that cash needs over the next twelve months will be substantially the same as they have been as reflected in our historical financial statements 
a summary of the effect of our operations on our cash flows is as follows operating activities fiscal net cash provided by operating activities was million higher than in fiscal  primarily driven by the following a decrease in our net loss  million lower current year accounts receivable due to faster collections on receivables with our largest customer   higher current year inventory and other assets due to higher gift inventory deposits  and million higher accounts payable and accrued expenses as a result of higher gift inventory purchases in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of increased bookings for fiscal investing activities investing activities for fiscal primarily consisted of purchases of operating equipment for our distribution facilities and the sale of one of our idle facilities located in yoakum  texas 
investing activities for the prior year primarily consisted of the million sale of our idle distribution center located in west bend  wisconsin  purchases of additional racking and other various leasehold improvements for our distribution facilities and completion of our acquisition of maquiladora chambers de mexico  sa de sa financing activities financing activities included credit facility net repayments of million in and net borrowings of million in fiscal this million improvement from the prior year was due to cash inflows generated from operations during the current year  the elimination of the requirement to maintain compensating balances with our canadian subsidiary s lender in connection with the termination of the canadian subsidiary s credit facility  and the use of previously restricted cash to pay down our outstanding debt balance 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities and borrowings under our credit facility 
information about our credit facilities is incorporated herein by reference to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
at june   we had million borrowing availability and million in outstanding borrowings under our credit facility  of which million was used to fund inventory deposits for gifts inventory expected to ship in the first half of fiscal our credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants  including covenants related to specified profitability  fixed charge coverage and minimum availability 
as of march  and june   we were in violation of covenants in our credit facility related to specified profitability and fixed charge coverage and  absent waivers obtained from our lender  would have breached these covenants 
as of march  and june   the violations of these covenants were due to one time events and changes in the timing of customer orders  respectively  which ultimately impacted our ability to meet the forecasts established under the credit facility 
for fiscal  our credit facility has been amended to reduce the fixed charge coverage covenant for certain months in fiscal we believe this amendment will reduce the likelihood we will encounter future covenant difficulties 
the credit facility was also previously amended to enable us to enter into a factoring program with our second largest customer whereby we expect to reduce receivable and debt balances faster and reduce our interest costs 
we believe that cash flows generated by operating activities and the borrowings and availability under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs for the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies we use estimates throughout our consolidated financial statements 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made or changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period  would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we have discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
in addition there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical as defined above 
changes in estimates could have a material impact on our operations and financial position 
the accounting policies and estimates we consider most critical are presented below 
revenues and accounts receivable allowances sales are recognized when merchandise is shipped and title to the goods has passed to the customer 
we record allowances  including cash discounts  in store customer allowances  cooperative advertising allowances  and customer returns  as a reduction of sales based upon historical experience  current trends in the retail industry  and individual customer and product experience 
actual returns and allowances may differ from our estimates and differences would affect the operating results of subsequent periods 
sensitivity analysis the following table presents the estimated effect of the indicated increase decrease in our net sales  based on fiscal net sales of million  on our customer allowance dollars in thousands except per share amounts 
changes in general economic conditions  trends and developments within our industry  or situations unique to specific customers could result in significant fluctuations in the actual effect of the estimate 
sales allowances earnings change reserves expense per share change in customer allowances and returns inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
cost includes the direct cost of purchased products and  for manufactured products  materials  direct and indirect labor  and factory overhead 
market  with respect to raw materials  is replacement cost and  with respect to work in process and finished goods  is net realizable value 
in our assessment of the value of inventory  we monitor retailer sell through rates  fashion trends  and the accumulation of excess inventory 
our assessment is both a quantitative measurement eg  the use of metrics such as the number of months supply on hand and qualitative measurement eg  the ability to utilize certain styles in current and future programs 
in general we have relationships with off price store customers that will purchase excess inventory at discounted prices and we have been able to realize values at or above the lower of cost or market values at which we carry our inventories 
if circumstances arise in which the market value of items in inventory declines below cost  an inventory markdown is estimated and charged to cost of sales in the period identified 
if we incorrectly anticipate these trends or if unexpected events occur  our results of operations could be materially affected 
sensitivity analysis the effect of a write down in the value of our inventory as of june  would be dollars in thousands except per share amounts percentage earnings of inventory inventory expense per share change in inventory write down uncertain tax positions tax liabilities  together with interest and applicable penalties  are recognized for the benefits of uncertain tax positions in the financial statements which more likely than not may not be realized 
we review the appropriateness of items of revenue or expense excluded or included in our tax returns and the requirements for filing returns with jurisdictions which may have laws requiring us to file tax returns 
failure to recognize a tax liability for the benefits of an uncertain tax position which ultimately is not realized could materially affect our financial position and results of operations 
share based compensation the fair values of restricted stock and performance unit grants payable in stock are estimated to be the market price of our common stock on the grant dates 
the fair values of performance units measured in phantom stock units  which are payable in cash  are estimated to be the market price of our common stock as of each reporting date 
the assumptions we use to estimate the fair value of our stock options are based on historical information and current economic conditions 
estimated fair values increase if the expected dividend yield decreases and the other assumptions increase 
neither the grant date market values of our stock nor the resulting output of the black scholes option pricing model using our assumptions may be the value ultimately realized by our directors and employees or accurately measure the tax benefits we may realize
