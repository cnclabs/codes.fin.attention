item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources of this report 
year ended december  in thousands tractors trailers total at december   we had major maintenance operations at our service centers in rialto  california  denver  colorado  atlanta  georgia  indianapolis  indiana  kansas city and parsons  kansas  greensboro  north carolina  columbus  ohio  harrisburg  pennsylvania  morristown and memphis  tennessee  dallas  texas  and salt lake city  utah 
in addition  other service center locations are equipped to perform routine and preventive maintenance and repairs on our equipment 
we adhere to established maintenance policies and procedures to help ensure our fleet is properly maintained 
linehaul tractors are routed to appropriate maintenance facilities at designated intervals  depending upon how the equipment has been utilized 
p d tractors and trailers are scheduled for maintenance every days 
marketing and customers at december   we had a sales staff of employees 
we compensate our sales force  in part  based upon certain operating metrics to help motivate our sales employees to achieve our service  growth and profitability objectives 
we utilize an integrated freight costing system to determine the price level at which a particular shipment of freight will be profitable 
we can modify elements of this freight costing model to simulate the actual conditions under which the freight will be moved 
we also compete for business by participating in bid solicitations 
customers generally solicit bids for relatively large numbers of shipments for a period of one to two years  and typically choose to enter into contractual arrangements with a limited number of motor carriers based upon price and service 
revenue is generated by customers dispersed primarily throughout the united states and north america 
in  our largest customer accounted for approximately of our revenue and our largest  and customers accounted for approximately  and of our revenue  respectively 
for each of the previous three years  approximately of our revenue was derived from transporting ltl shipments for our customers and less than of our revenue was generated from international services 
we believe the diversity of our customer base helps protect our business from adverse developments in a single geographic region and the reduction or loss of business from a single customer 

table of contents seasonality our operations are subject to seasonal trends common in the trucking industry 
our operating margins in the first quarter are normally lower due to reduced demand during the winter months 
harsh weather can also adversely affect our performance by reducing demand and reducing our ability to transport freight  which could result in decreased revenue and increased operating expenses 
technology we continually upgrade our technological capabilities  and we provide access to our systems through multiple gateways that offer our customers maximum flexibility and immediate access to information 
we employ vehicle safety systems  on board and hand held computer systems  freight handling systems and logistics technology to reduce costs and transit times 
we continue to focus on the development and enhancement of the technology used in our operations in order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our services 
insurance we carry a significant amount of insurance with third party insurance carriers  but we are exposed to the risk of loss on claims up to the limit for which we are self insured 
we are currently self insured for bodily injury and property damage bipd claims up to million per occurrence 
cargo loss and damage claims are self insured up to  per occurrence 
we are exposed to workers compensation claims up to million per occurrence  through either self insurance or insurance deductibles 
effective january   our group health claims are self insured up to  per occurrence  an increase from  in  plus an aggregate  over our retention level 
we believe that our policy of self insuring a portion of our risks  supported by our safety and loss prevention programs  is an effective means of managing insurance costs 
we also believe that our current insurance coverage is adequate to cover our liability risks 
diesel fuel availability and cost our industry depends heavily upon the availability of diesel fuel 
although we maintained fuel storage and pumping facilities at  or  of our service center locations at december   we may experience shortages at certain locations and may be forced to incur additional expense to help ensure adequate supply on a timely basis to prevent a disruption to our service schedules 
we implemented a fuel surcharge program in august  which has remained in effect since that time and is one of many components that we use to determine the overall price for our transportation services 
our fuel surcharges are generally indexed to fuel prices published by the us department of energy the doe that reset each week 
our management believes that our operations and financial condition are susceptible to the same diesel fuel price increases or shortages as those of our competitors 
diesel fuel costs  including fuel taxes  totaled  and of revenue in  and  respectively 
employees as of december   we employed  individuals on a full time basis  none of which were represented under a collective bargaining agreement 
our full time employees work in the following roles category number of employees drivers platform fleet technicians sales salaried  clerical and other total 
table of contents as of december   we employed  linehaul drivers and  p d drivers on a full time basis 
we select our drivers primarily based upon safe driving records and experience 
each of our drivers is required to pass a drug test  have a current us department of transportation dot physical and have a valid commercial driver s license prior to employment 
once employed  drivers are required to obtain and maintain hazardous materials endorsements to their commercial driver s licenses 
drivers  as well as all employees  are required to take pre employment drug and alcohol tests and are randomly selected for periodic additional testing 
to help fulfill driver needs  we offer qualified employees the opportunity to become drivers through the old dominion driver training program 
since its inception in   individuals have graduated from this program 
of the program graduates  we have experienced an annual turnover rate of approximately  which is below our company wide average turnover rate of approximately for drivers 
we believe our driver training and qualification programs have been important factors in improving our safety record and retaining our qualified drivers 
drivers with safe driving records are rewarded with bonuses of up to  payable each year 
driver safety bonuses paid during and were million and million  respectively 
governmental regulation we are subject to regulation by the federal motor carrier safety administration the fmcsa  the pipeline and hazardous materials safety agency and the surface transportation board  which are agencies within the dot  as well as the regulations of various state agencies 
these regulatory authorities have broad powers  generally governing matters such as authority to engage in motor carrier operations  motor carrier registration  driver hours of service  safety and fitness of transportation equipment and drivers  certain mergers  consolidations and acquisitions  and periodic financial reporting 
in addition  we are subject to compliance with cargo security and transportation regulations issued by the transportation security administration within the us department of homeland security 
in october  the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit ordered the fmcsa to review and re issue rules governing hours of service for commercial truck drivers by july  this deadline was extended and on december   the fmcsa issued its final rule  which requires compliance by july  the final rule reduces the maximum number of hours a truck driver can work each week to hours from the current hour limit 
the rule maintains the current maximum hour daily driving limit  but requires drivers to take a minute break prior to driving beyond eight hours 
the rule also includes a hour restart provision that allows drivers to restart the clock on their work week by taking at least consecutive hours off duty  provided these off duty hours includes two periods between am and am and occurs only once during a seven day period 
we do not believe this new rule  when implemented  will have a significant impact on our operating procedures and will not significantly impact our costs 
we are  however  subject to future rulemaking by the fmcsa  which could be more stringent  require changes to our operations  increase our operating costs and otherwise adversely impact our results of operations 
the trucking industry is subject to regulatory and legislative changes from a variety of other governmental authorities  which address matters such as i increasingly stringent environmental and occupational safety and health regulations  ii limits on vehicle weight and size  iii ergonomics  iv port security  and v hours of service 
these changes may affect our business or the economics of our industry by requiring changes in operating practices  or by influencing the demand for and increasing the costs of providing our services 
environmental regulation we are subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations that focus on  among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the environment or their presence on or in our properties and vehicles  fuel storage tanks  transportation of certain materials  and the discharge or retention of storm water 
under specific environmental laws  we could also be held responsible for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at third party waste disposal sites  as well as costs associated with clean up of accidents involving our vehicles 
we do not believe that the cost of future compliance with current environmental laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial condition  competitive position or capital expenditures for the remainder of fiscal year or fiscal year however  future changes to laws or regulations may adversely affect our operations and could result in unforeseen costs to our business

item a 
risk factors various factors exist that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward looking statement 
in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report  we believe the following are some of the important risks and uncertainties that could materially affect our business  financial condition or results of operations we operate in a highly competitive industry  and our business will suffer if we are unable to adequately address potential downward pricing pressures and other factors that may adversely affect our operations and profitability 
numerous competitive factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the following we compete with many other transportation service providers of varying sizes  some of which may have more equipment  a broader global network  a wider range of services  greater capital resources or other competitive advantages  some of our competitors periodically reduce their prices to gain business  especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy  which may limit our ability to maintain or increase prices or maintain revenue  we may be unable to continue to collect fuel surcharges or our fuel surcharge program may become ineffective in mitigating the impact of fluctuating costs for fuel and other petroleum based products  many customers reduce the number of carriers they use by selecting core carriers as approved transportation service providers and we may not be selected  many customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs  and this process may depress prices or result in the loss of some business to competitors  some customers may choose to operate their own private trucking fleet or may choose to increase the volume of freight they transport if they have an existing private trucking fleet  the trend towards consolidation in the ground transportation industry may create other large carriers with greater financial resources and other competitive advantages relating to their size  advances in technology require increased investments to remain competitive  and our customers may not be willing to accept higher prices to cover the cost of these investments  and competition from non asset based logistics and freight brokerage companies may adversely affect our customer relationships and ability to maintain sufficient pricing 
if we are unable to effectively compete with other ltl carriers  whether on the basis of price  service or otherwise  we may be unable to retain existing customers or attract new customers  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents if our employees were to unionize  our operating costs would increase and our ability to compete would be impaired 
none of our employees are currently represented under a collective bargaining agreement 
however  from time to time there have been efforts to organize our employees at various service centers 
further  congress or one or more states could approve legislation significantly affecting our business and our relationship with our employees  such as the proposed federal legislation referred to as the employee free choice act  which would substantially liberalize the procedures for union organization 
in addition  we can offer no assurance that the department of labor will not adopt new regulations or interpret existing regulations in a manner that would favor the agenda of unions  or that our employees will not unionize in the future  particularly if regulatory changes occur that facilitate unionization 
the unionization of our employees could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations because some shippers have indicated that they intend to limit their use of unionized trucking companies because of the threat of strikes and other work stoppages  restrictive work rules could hamper our efforts to improve and sustain operating efficiency  restrictive work rules could impair our service reputation and limit our ability to provide next day services  a strike or work stoppage would negatively impact our profitability and could damage customer and employee relationships  and an election and bargaining process could divert management s time and attention from our overall objectives and impose significant expenses 
if we are unable to successfully execute our growth strategy  our business and future results of operations may suffer 
our growth strategy includes increasing the volume of freight moving through our existing service center network  selectively expanding our geographic footprint and broadening the scope of our service offerings 
in connection with our growth strategy  at various times  we have made selective acquisitions  purchased additional equipment  expanded and upgraded service centers and increased our sales and marketing efforts  and we expect to continue to do so 
our growth strategy exposes us to a number of risks  including the following geographic expansion requires start up costs that could expose us to temporary losses  growth and geographic expansion are dependent on the availability of real estate  and shortages of suitable real estate may limit our geographic expansion and might cause congestion in our service center network  which could result in increased operating expenses  growth may strain our management  capital resources  information systems and customer service  hiring new employees may increase training costs and may result in temporary inefficiencies until those employees become proficient in their jobs  and expanding our service offerings may require us to enter into new markets and encounter new competitive challenges 
we cannot assure that we will overcome the risks associated with our growth strategy 
if we fail to overcome those risks  we may not realize additional revenue or profits from our efforts  we may incur additional expenses and  therefore  our financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we may be unable to successfully consummate and integrate acquisitions as part of our growth strategy 
growth through acquisitions has been a key component of our ltl growth strategy throughout our history 
in the future  we may seek to acquire other ltl carriers as well as other complementary businesses 
exploration of potential acquisitions requires significant attention from our senior management team 
in addition  we expect to compete for acquisition opportunities with other companies  some of which may have greater financial and other resources than we do 
we cannot assure that we will 
table of contents have sufficient cash with which to consummate an acquisition or otherwise be able to obtain financing for any acquisition 
if we are unable to access sufficient funding for potential acquisitions  we may not be able to complete transactions that we otherwise find advantageous 
any subsequent acquisition will entail numerous risks  including we may not achieve anticipated levels of revenue  efficiency  cash flows and profitability  we may experience difficulties managing businesses that are outside our historical core competency and markets  we may underestimate the resources required to support acquisitions  which could disrupt our ongoing business and distract our management  we may incur unanticipated costs to our infrastructure to support new business lines or separate legal entities  we may be required to temporarily match existing customer pricing in the acquiree s markets  which may be lower than the rates that we would typically charge for our services  liabilities we assume could be greater than our original estimates or not disclosed to us at the time of acquisition  we may incur additional indebtedness or we may issue additional shares of stock to finance future acquisitions  which could be dilutive to our shareholders  potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired company  and an inability to recognize projected cost savings and economies of scale 
in addition  we may have difficulty integrating any acquired business and its operations  services and personnel into our existing operations  and such integration may require a significant amount of time and effort by our management team 
to the extent we do not successfully avoid or overcome the risks or problems resulting from any acquisitions we undertake  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our customers and suppliers business may be impacted by a downturn in the economy and or a disruption of financial markets 
adverse economic conditions can negatively affect our customers business levels  the amount of transportation services they need  their ability to pay for our services and overall freight levels  all of which might impair our asset utilization 
customers encountering adverse economic conditions may be unable to obtain additional financing  or financing under acceptable terms  due to disruptions in the capital and credit markets 
these customers represent a greater potential for bad debt losses  which may require us to increase our reserve for bad debt 
economic conditions resulting in bankruptcies of one or more of our large customers could have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 
further  when adverse economic times arise customers may bid out freight or select competitors that offer lower rates from among existing choices in an attempt to lower their costs and we might be forced to lower our rates or lose freight 
our suppliers business levels also may be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions or financial constraints  which could lead to disruptions in the supply and availability of equipment  parts and services critical to our operations 
a significant interruption in our normal supply chain could disrupt our operations  increase our costs and negatively impact our ability to serve our customers 
we also are subject to cost increases outside our control that could materially reduce our profitability if we are unable to increase our rates sufficiently 
such cost increases include  but are not limited to  increases in fuel prices  driver wages  interest rates  taxes  tolls  license and registration fees  insurance  revenue equipment and healthcare for our employees 
increases in driver compensation or other difficulties attracting and retaining qualified drivers could adversely affect our profitability and ability to maintain or grow our fleet 
from time to time we have experienced difficulty in attracting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified drivers and such shortages may recur in the future 
because of the intense competition for drivers  we may face difficulty maintaining or increasing our number of drivers 
the compensation we offer our drivers is subject to market conditions that may require increases in driver compensation  which 
table of contents becomes more likely as economic conditions improve 
if we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of drivers  we could be required to adjust our compensation packages  or operate with fewer trucks and face difficulty meeting shipper demands  all of which could adversely affect our profitability and ability to maintain our size or grow 
insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our profitability 
we are exposed to claims related to cargo loss and damage  property damage  personal injury  workers compensation  long term disability  group health and dental 
we have insurance coverage with third party insurance carriers  but self insure for a significant portion of the risk associated with these claims 
our operating results would be adversely affected if any of the following were to occur i the number or severity of claims for which we are self insured increases  ii we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts because the claims prove to be more severe than our original assessment  or iii claims exceed our excess coverage amounts 
if claims exceed our retention levels or insurance market conditions change  insurers could raise premiums for excess coverage to cover their expenses and anticipated future losses 
in addition  insurance companies require us to obtain letters of credit to collateralize our self insured retention 
if these requirements increase  our borrowing capacity could be adversely affected 
we have significant ongoing cash requirements that could limit our growth and affect our profitability if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital 
our business is highly capital intensive 
we generally finance our capital expenditures and planned growth with existing cash  cash flow from operations  issuance of debt and through available borrowings under our existing senior unsecured credit agreement 
we may require additional capital to finance long term real estate purchase opportunities and acquisitions  which we may fund through additional debt or through equity offerings 
if we are unable in the future to generate sufficient cash from our operations or raise capital by accessing the debt and equity markets  we may be forced to limit our growth and operate our equipment for longer periods of time  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
our business also has significant ongoing operating cash requirements 
if our cash requirements are high or our cash flow from operations is low during particular periods  we may need to seek additional financing  which may be costly or difficult to obtain 
limited supply and increased prices for new equipment may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow 
we may face difficulty in purchasing new equipment due to decreased supply and increased costs 
investment in new equipment is a significant part of our annual capital expenditures and we require an available supply of tractors and trailers from equipment manufacturers to operate and grow our business 
we are also subject to shortages in raw materials that are required for the production of critical operating equipment and supplies  such as shortages in rubber or steel 
the price of our equipment may also be adversely affected in the future by regulations on newly manufactured tractors and diesel engines 
we have incurred significant increases in the cost of tractors due to the us environmental protection agency s the epa regulations that require progressive reductions in exhaust emissions from diesel engines 
beginning in october  new diesel engines were required to meet these new emission limits 
some of the regulations required reductions in the sulfur content of diesel fuel beginning in june and the introduction of emissions after treatment devices on newly manufactured engines and vehicles beginning with model year the final phase of these regulations required reduced nitrogen and non methane hydrocarbon emissions beginning with model year these regulations have resulted in higher prices for tractors and diesel engines and increased operating and maintenance costs  and there can be no assurance that continued increases in pricing or costs will not have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
a decrease in the demand and value of used equipment may impact our results of operations 
as we purchase new tractors as part of our normal replacement cycle each year  we rely on the used equipment market to dispose of our older equipment 
oversupply in the transportation industry as well as 
table of contents adverse domestic and foreign economic conditions can negatively impact the demand for used tractors and  therefore  reduce the value we can obtain on our used equipment 
if we are unable to sell our older equipment at or above salvage value  the resulting losses could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
we may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in the availability and price of diesel fuel 
diesel fuel is a critical component of our operations and a significant operating expense for our business 
diesel fuel prices and fuel availability can be impacted by factors beyond our control  such as natural or man made disasters  political events  price and supply decisions by oil producing countries and cartels  terrorist activities  armed conflict and world supply and demand imbalances 
we maintain fuel storage and pumping facilities at many of our service center locations  however  we may experience shortages in the availability of diesel fuel at certain locations and may be forced to incur additional expense to ensure adequate supply on a timely basis to prevent a disruption to our service schedules 
an interruption in the supply of diesel fuel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we do not hedge against the risk of diesel fuel price increases 
an increase in diesel fuel prices or diesel fuel taxes  or any change in federal or state regulations that results in such an increase  could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we have fuel surcharge programs in place with a majority of our customers  which have helped us offset the majority of the negative impact of the increased cost of diesel fuel and other petroleum based products 
however  we also incur fuel costs that cannot be recovered even with respect to customers with which we maintain fuel surcharge programs  such as those costs associated with empty miles  deadhead miles or the time when our engines are idling 
because our fuel surcharge recovery lags behind changes in fuel prices  our fuel surcharge recovery may not capture the increased costs we pay for fuel  especially when prices are rising  leading to fluctuations in our levels of reimbursement 
we regularly monitor the components of our pricing  including fuel surcharges  and address individual account profitability issues with our customers when necessary  however  there can be no assurance that fuel surcharges can be maintained indefinitely or will be sufficiently effective in offsetting increases in diesel fuel prices 
we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations  and costs of compliance with  liabilities under  or violations of  existing or future environmental laws or regulations could adversely affect our business 
we are subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern  among other things  the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the environment  the presence of hazardous materials at our properties or in our vehicles  fuel storage tanks  the transportation of certain materials and the discharge or retention of storm water 
under certain environmental laws  we could also be held responsible for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at third party waste disposal sites  as well as costs associated with the clean up of accidents involving our vehicles 
environmental laws have become and are expected to continue to be increasingly more stringent over time  and there can be no assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental laws or liabilities arising under such laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operations or financial condition 
in addition to the epa regulations on exhaust emissions with which we must comply  there is an increased regulatory focus on climate change and greenhouse gas emissions in the united states 
as a result  we may become subject to additional legislation or rulemaking that could adversely impact our business 
any future limitations on the emission of greenhouse gases or other environmental legislation could increase our future capital expenditures and have an adverse impact on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
we operate in a highly regulated industry  and increased costs of compliance with  or liability for violation of  existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are regulated by the dot and by various state agencies 
these regulatory authorities have broad powers  generally governing matters such as authority to engage in motor carrier operations  as well as motor carrier registration  driver hours of service  safety and fitness of transportation equipment and drivers  transportation of hazardous materials  certain mergers and acquisitions and periodic financial reporting 
in addition  the trucking industry is subject to regulatory and legislative changes from a variety 
table of contents of other governmental authorities  which address matters such as i increasingly stringent environmental  occupational safety and health regulations  ii limits on vehicle weight and size  iii ergonomics  iv port security  and v hours of service 
in addition  we are subject to compliance with cargo security and transportation regulations issued by the transportation security administration within the us department of homeland security 
regulatory requirements  and changes in regulatory requirements  may affect our business or the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by influencing the demand for and increasing the costs of providing transportation services 
in october  the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit ordered the fmcsa to review and re issue rules governing hours of service for commercial truck drivers by july  this deadline was extended and on december   the fmcsa issued its final rule  which requires compliance by july  the final rule reduces the maximum number of hours a truck driver can work each week to hours from the current hour limit 
the rule maintains the current maximum hour daily driving limit  but requires drivers to take a minute break prior to driving beyond eight hours 
the rule also includes a hour restart provision that allows drivers to restart the clock on their work week by taking at least consecutive hours off duty  provided these off duty hours includes two periods between am and am and occurs only once during a seven day period 
we do not believe this new rule  when implemented  will have a significant impact on our operating procedures and will not significantly impact our costs 
we are  however  subject to future rulemaking by the fmcsa and other regulatory agencies  which could be more stringent  require changes to our operations  increase our operating costs and otherwise adversely impact our results of operations 
the implementation of fmcsa s compliance  safety  accountability initiative csa could adversely impact our ability to hire qualified drivers  meet our growth projections and maintain our customer relationships  each of which could adversely impact our results of operations 
in december  the fmcsa began implementation of csa  a new compliance and enforcement initiative designed to monitor and improve commercial motor vehicle safety 
csa measures both the safety record of the motor carrier and the driver 
these measurements are scored and used by the fmcsa to identify potential safety risks and to direct enforcement action 
csa scores for transportation companies are currently available on the fmcsa s website and will eventually replace safestat  the fmcsa s former safety measurement system 
our csa scores are dependent upon our safety and compliance experience  which could change at any time 
in addition  the safety standards prescribed in csa could change and our ability to maintain an acceptable score could be adversely impacted 
if we receive an unacceptable csa score  our relationships with our customers could be damaged  which could result in a loss of business 
the implementation of csa could also shrink the industry s pool of drivers as those with unfavorable scores could leave the industry 
as a result  the costs to attract  train and retain qualified drivers could increase 
in addition  a shortage of qualified drivers could increase driver turnover  decrease asset utilization  limit growth and adversely impact our results of operations 
our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors and harsh weather conditions 
our operations are subject to seasonal trends common in the trucking industry 
our operating margins in the first quarter are normally lower due to reduced demand during the winter months 
harsh weather can also adversely affect our performance by reducing demand and reducing our ability to transport freight  which could result in decreased revenue and increased operating expenses 
if we are unable to retain our key employees  our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity could be adversely affected 
our success will continue to depend upon the experience and leadership of our key employees and executive officers 
in that regard  the loss of the services of any of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity

congdon and members of their respective families beneficially own an aggregate of approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
as long as the congdon family controls a large portion of our voting stock  they may be able to significantly influence the election of the entire board of directors and the outcome of all matters involving a shareholder vote 
the congdon family s interests may differ from the interests of other shareholders and the status of their ownership could change at their discretion 
our financial results may be adversely impacted by potential future changes in accounting practices 
future changes in accounting standards or practices  and related legal and regulatory interpretations of those changes  may adversely impact public companies in general  the transportation industry or our operations specifically 
new accounting standards or requirements  such as a conversion from us generally accepted accounting principles to international financial reporting standards  could change the way we record revenues  expenses  assets and or liabilities or could be costly to implement 
these types of regulations could have a negative impact on our financial position  liquidity  results of operations and or access to capital 
our information technology systems are subject to certain risks that we cannot control 
we have become increasingly reliant on our information systems for our operations as well as providing a value added service to our customers 
our information systems  including our accounting systems  are dependent upon third party software  global communications providers  data network systems and other aspects of technology and internet infrastructure that are susceptible to failure or an adverse cyber incident 
although we have implemented redundant systems and network security measures  our information technology remains susceptible to outages  computer viruses  break ins and similar disruptions 
such an event could inhibit our ability to provide services to our customers and the ability of our customers to access our systems 
in addition  there could be a loss of confidential information  corruption of data and damage to our brand image 
this may result in a reduction in demand for our services or the loss of customers that could have a negative impact on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
if we raise additional capital in the future  your ownership in us could be diluted 
any issuance of equity we may undertake in the future to raise additional capital could cause the price of our common stock to decline  or require us to issue shares at a price that is lower than that paid by holders of our common stock in the past  which would result in those newly issued shares being dilutive 
if we obtain funds through a credit facility or through the issuance of debt or preferred securities  these obligations and securities would likely have rights senior to your rights as a common shareholder  which could impair the value of our common stock 
the market value of our common stock may fluctuate and could be substantially affected by various factors 
the price of our common stock on the nasdaq global select market  or nasdaq  constantly changes 
we expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate 
our share price may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include  among others actual or anticipated variations in earnings  financial or operating performance or liquidity  changes in analysts recommendations or projections  failure to meet analysts projections  general economic and capital market conditions  announcements of developments related to our business  operating and stock performance of other companies deemed to be peers  actions by government regulators  and news reports of trends  concerns and other issues related to us or our industry  including changes in regulations 

table of contents our common stock price may fluctuate significantly in the future  and these fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance 
general market price declines or market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of our common stock  and the current market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices 
our articles of incorporation  our bylaws and virginia law contain provisions that could discourage  delay or prevent a change in our control or our management 
provisions of our articles of incorporation  bylaws and the laws of virginia  the state in which we are incorporated  may discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of us or a change in management that shareholders may consider favorable 
these provisions limit who may call a special meeting of shareholders  require shareholder action by written consent to be unanimous  establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at shareholder meetings  may make it difficult to merge with or otherwise absorb a virginia corporation acquired in a tender offer for the three years after the acquisition  and may make an unsolicited attempt to gain control of us more difficult by restricting the right of specified shareholders to vote newly acquired large blocks of stock 
these provisions could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other shareholders to take certain corporate actions 
these provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock
