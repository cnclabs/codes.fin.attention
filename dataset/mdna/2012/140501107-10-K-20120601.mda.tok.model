results of operations the composite measure of our financial performance in the consolidated statements of operations is captioned increase in net assets from operations and consists of three elements 
the first is net investment income  which is the difference between income from interest  dividends and fees and our combined operating and interest expenses  net of applicable income taxes 
the second element is net realized gain loss on investments  which is the difference between the proceeds received from the disposition of portfolio securities and their stated cost  net of applicable income tax expense based on our tax year 
the third element is the net increase decrease in unrealized appreciation of investments  which is the net change in the market or fair value of our investment portfolio  compared with stated cost 
it should be noted that the net realized gain loss on investments and net increase decrease in unrealized appreciation of investments are directly related in that when an appreciated portfolio security is sold to realize a gain  a corresponding decrease in net unrealized appreciation occurs by transferring the gain associated with the transaction from being unrealized to being realized 
conversely  when a loss is realized on a depreciated portfolio security  an increase in net unrealized appreciation occurs

transfer taxes in the amount of  related to the transfer of real estate were deducted from the realized gain on the lifemark transaction management does not attempt to maintain a consistent level of realized gains from year to year  but instead attempts to maximize total investment portfolio appreciation
