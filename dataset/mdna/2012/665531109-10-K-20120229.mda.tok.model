item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data in item and the financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview of results during  we achieved the following financial and operating results production growth compared to  proved reserve growth compared to  participated in the completion of gross net wells  with a success rate in the bakken and three forks plays  continued expansion of our activities in the bakken shale by growing production  proving up acreage and acquiring additional acreage  maintained a strong balance sheet by retaining a debt to capitalization ratio of  entered into additional derivative contracts for and  realized million of cash flow from operating activities  and ended the year with stockholders equity of million 
operationally  our performance reflects another year of successfully executing our strategy of developing our acreage position and building a long life reserve base 
our success enabled us to increase proved reserves by million boe  which is more than times production 
during  production increased to million boe as compared to production of million boe 
the increase in production was driven by a increase in producing net wells from net wells at december  to net wells at december  total revenues increased in compared to this increase was due to higher production and a million non cash gain from mark to market of derivative instruments 
average realized prices on a boe basis including all realized derivative settlements were higher in compared to as discussed elsewhere in this report  significant changes in crude oil and natural gas prices can have a material impact on our results of operations and our balance sheet  including the fair value of our derivatives 
the following table sets forth selected operating data for the periods indicated 
production volumes and average sales prices are derived from accrued accounting data for the relevant period indicated

in  crude oil  natural gas and ngl sales increased from  driven primarily by a increase in production and partially aided by a increase in realized prices taking into account the effect of settled derivatives 
in  crude oil and natural gas sales increased from due to a increase in realized prices  and a increase in production 
our production continues to grow through drilling success as we place new wells into production and through additions from acquisitions  partially offset by the natural decline of our crude oil and natural gas sales from existing wells 
for  our production volumes increased as compared to for  our production volumes increased as compared to the production primarily increased due to the addition of and net productive wells in and  respectively 
our production for each of the last three years is set forth in the following table year ended production crude oil bbl natural gas and ngl mcf total boe average daily production crude oil bbl natural gas and ngl mcf total boe represents volumes produced 
natural gas and ngls are converted to boe at the rate of one barrel equals six mcf based upon the approximate relative energy content of crude oil and natural gas  which is not necessarily indicative of the relationship of crude oil and natural gas prices 
we enter into derivative instruments to manage the price risk attributable to future crude oil production 
for  we incurred a loss on settled derivatives of  compared to  in and  in our average realized price including all derivative settlements received during was per boe compared to per boe in and per boe in our average realized price including all derivative settlements calculation includes all cash settlements for derivatives 
mark to market derivative gains and losses mark to market derivative gains and losses were gains of  in compared to a  loss in and a  loss in most of our derivatives are not designated for hedge accounting and are accounted for using the mark to market accounting method whereby gains and losses from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recognized immediately into earnings 
mark to market accounting treatment creates volatility in our revenues as unrealized gains and losses from derivatives are included in total revenues and are not included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying balance sheets 
as commodity prices increase or decrease  such changes will have an opposite effect on the mark to market value of our derivatives 
any gains on our derivatives will be offset by lower wellhead revenues in the future or any losses will be offset by higher future wellhead revenues based on the value at the settlement date 
at december   all of our derivative contracts are recorded at their fair value  which was a net liability of  a decrease of million from the  net liability recorded as of december  production expenses production expenses were  in compared to  in and  in we experience increases in operating expenses as we add new wells and maintain production from existing properties 
on a per unit basis  production expenses per boe increased from per barrel sold in to in on a per unit basis  production expenses per boe increased from per barrel sold in to in these increases are related to higher operating costs primarily in our williston basin activities 
the largest cost driver in our williston basin operations is the disposal of water 
on an absolute dollar basis  our spending for production expenses for was higher when compared to due to production levels increasing  higher water hauling and disposal costs and workover expenses 
on an absolute dollar basis  our spending for production expenses for was higher when compared to due to production levels increasing and higher water hauling and disposal expenses 
production taxes we pay production taxes based on realized crude oil and natural gas sales 
these costs were  in compared to  in and  in our production taxes were  and in  and  respectively 
the average production tax rate was lower than the average due to well additions that qualified for reduced rates or tax exemptions during certain portions of our production occurs in montana and north dakota jurisdictions that have lower initial tax rates for an established period of time or until an established threshold of production is exceeded  after which the tax rates are increased to the standard tax rate 
the average production tax rate was higher than the average due to the increased weighting of north dakota oil revenues in the majority of our production is located in north dakota which imposes a standard tax on our production revenues except for where properties qualify for reduced rates 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense was  for compared to  for and  in the increase of million when compared to is due to higher base salaries and benefits million  increased share based compensation expense million  higher legal and professional expenses million  increased travel expenses million and higher office and other administrative expenses due to the addition of adding more employees million 
as a result of our growth  the number of employees increased by in as compared to to provide additional staffing in the legal  finance and land departments 
the increase of million when compared to is due to higher base salaries and benefits million  increased share based compensation expense million  increased travel expenses million and higher office and other administrative expenses million 
our personnel costs continue to increase as we invest in our technical teams and other staffing to support our growth 
share based compensation expense represents the amortization of restricted stock grants granted to our employees and directors as part of compensation as well as fully vested share grants to employees and directors throughout the year 
depletion  depreciation and amortization depletion  depreciation and amortization dd a was  in compared to  in and  in depletion expense  the largest component of dd a  was per boe in compared to per boe in and per boe in our depletion expense is based on the capitalized costs related to properties having proved reserves  plus the estimated future development costs and asset retirement costs which are depleted and amortized on the unit of production method based on the estimated gross proved reserves determined by independent petroleum engineers 
we have historically adjusted our depletion rates in the fourth quarter of each year based on the year end reserve report and other times during the year when circumstances indicate there has been a significant change in reserves or costs 
the increase in depletion expense for compared to was driven by a increase in production 
additionally  depletion rates rose in due to an increase in our future development cost estimates to reflect the changes in well completion methodologies eg more stimulation costs per well due to longer lateral extensions 
depletion rates in new plays tend to be higher in the beginning as increased initial outlays are amortized over proved reserves based on early stages of evaluations 
as these plays mature  new technologies  well completion methodologies and additional historical operating information impact the reserve evaluations

non gaap financial measures pre tax pv value may be considered a non gaap financial measure as defined by the sec and is derived from the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows  which is the most directly comparable standardized financial measure 
pre tax pv value is computed on the same basis as the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows but without deducting future income taxes 
as of december   our discounted future income taxes were million and our standardized measure of after tax discounted future net cash flows was million 
we believe pre tax pv value is a useful measure for investors for evaluating the relative monetary significance of our crude oil and natural gas properties 
we further believe investors may utilize pre tax pv value as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our reserves to other companies because many factors that are unique to each individual company impact the amount of future income taxes to be paid 
our management uses this measure when assessing the potential return on investment related to our crude oil and natural gas properties and acquisitions 
however  pre tax pv value is not a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows 
our pre tax pv value and the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows do not purport to present the fair value of our crude oil and natural gas reserves 
our non gaap net income  which excludes unrealized mark to market derivative gains and losses net of tax  for the year ended december   was  representing approximately per diluted share as compared to our non gaap net income  which excludes unrealized mark to market hedging gains and losses net of tax of  representing approximately per diluted share for the year ended december  the increase in non gaap net income is primarily due to our continued addition of crude oil and natural gas production from new wells and higher realized commodity prices in compared to we define adjusted ebitda as net income before i interest expense  ii income taxes  iii depreciation  depletion and amortization  iv accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations  v gain loss on mark to market of derivative instruments and vii non cash expenses relating to share based payments recognized under asc topic adjusted ebitda for the year ended december  was  compared to adjusted ebitda of  for the year ended december  the increase in adjusted ebitda is primarily due to our continued addition of crude oil and natural gas production from new wells and higher realized commodity prices in compared to we believe the use of these non gaap financial measures provides useful information to investors to gain an overall understanding of our current financial performance 
specifically  we believe the non gaap financial measures included herein provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses and unrealized commodity gains and losses that our management believes are not indicative of our core operating results 
in addition  these non gaap financial measures are used by management for budgeting and forecasting as well as subsequently measuring our performance  and we believe that we are providing investors with financial measures that most closely align to our internal measurement processes 
we consider these non gaap measures to be useful in evaluating our core operating results as they more closely reflect our essential revenue generating activities and direct operating expenses resulting in cash expenditures needed to perform these revenue generating activities 
our management also believes  based on feedback provided by the investment community  that the non gaap financial measures are necessary to allow the investment community to construct its valuation models to better compare our results with our competitors and market sector 
the non gaap financial information is presented using consistent methodology from year to year 
these measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap 
in addition  these non gaap financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles 
we believe that non gaap financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with gaap and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding gaap financial measures 
net income excluding unrealized mark to market derivative gains and losses and adjusted ebitda are non gaap measures 
a reconciliation of these measures to gaap is included below northern oil and gas  inc reconciliation of gaap net income to non gaap net income excluding unrealized mark to market derivative gains and losses year ended december  net income gain loss on mark to market of derivative instruments tax impact net income without the effect of certain items net income per common share basic net income per common share diluted weighted average shares outstanding basic weighted average shares outstanding diluted net income per common share basic change due to mark to market of derivative instruments change due to tax impact net income without effect of certain items per common share basic net income per common share diluted change due to mark to market of derivative instruments change due to tax impact net income without effect of certain items per common share diluted northern oil and gas  inc reconciliation of adjusted ebitda year ended december  net income add back income tax provision depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion share based compensation gain loss on mark to market derivative instruments interest expense adjusted ebitda operation plan we expect to spend million in with associated drilling capital expenditures 
the wells are expected to target both the bakken and three forks formations 
drilling capital expenditures are expected to increase in due to the continued success of longer laterals and additional fracture stimulation stages 
we currently expect to drill wells during at an average completed cost of million to million per well  which represents a to increase in drilling costs for compared to based on evolving conditions in the field  we expect to continue to evaluate further strategic acreage acquisitions during additionally  we expect to spend approximately million to million on acreage capital expenditures during northern has the ability to adjust capital expenditures by reducing the number of projects we elect to participate in 
we currently expect to fund all commitments using a combination of cash on hand  cash flow generated by operations  bank borrowings and potential debt financings 
our future financial results will depend primarily on i the ability to continue to source and screen potential projects  ii the ability to discover commercial quantities of crude oil and natural gas  iii the market price for crude oil and natural gas  and iv the ability to fully implement our exploration and development program  which is dependent on the availability of capital resources 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in any of these respects  that the prices of crude oil and natural gas prevailing at the time of production will be at a level allowing for profitable production  or that we will be able to obtain additional funding if necessary 
as of february   we controlled the rights to mineral leases covering approximately  net acres prospective for the bakken and three forks 
in the first quarter of through february   we acquired approximately  net acres at an average price of  per acre 
our goal is to continue to explore for and develop hydrocarbons within the mineral leases we control as well as continue to expand our acreage position should opportunities present themselves 
to accomplish our objectives we must achieve the following continue to develop our substantial inventory of high quality core bakken acreage with results consistent with those to date  retain and attract talented personnel  continue to be a low cost producer of hydrocarbons  actively manage our cost structure and focus on accretive acquisitions  and continue to manage our financial obligations to access the appropriate capital needed to develop our position of primarily undrilled acreage 
liquidity and capital resources our main sources of liquidity and capital resources are internally generated cash flow from operations  a credit facility and access to the debt and equity capital markets 
we continue to take steps to ensure adequate capital resources and liquidity to fund our capital expenditure program 
in the future  we anticipate we will be able to provide the necessary liquidity by the revenues generated from the sales of our crude oil and natural gas reserves in our existing properties  credit facility borrowings and potential equity or debt issuances 
however there is no guarantee the capital markets will be available to us on favorable terms or at all 
our opinions concerning liquidity and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward looking statements are based on currently available information 
if this information proves to be inaccurate  future availability of financing may be adversely affected 
factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance  crude oil and natural gas prices  the value of our reserves  the state of the worldwide debt and equity markets  investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance  the global financial climate and  in particular  with respect to borrowings  the level of our working capital or outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies 
overview at december   our debt to total capitalization ratio was  we had million of debt outstanding  million of stockholders equity  and million of cash on hand 
at december   we had no debt  million of stockholders equity  million of cash on hand and million in short term investments 
in  we generated million of cash provided by operating activities  an increase of million from cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to increased investment in oil and gas properties net wells added in  higher crude oil production volumes and higher average sales prices for both crude oil and natural gas in these positive factors were partially offset by increased production expenses  production taxes and general and administrative expenses during as compared to cash flows from operating activities and advances under our revolving credit facility were used to partially fund approximately million of drilling and development expenditures and million of acreage acquisition expenditures in cash flow cash flows from operations are primarily affected by production volumes and commodity prices  net of the effects of settlements of our derivatives 
our cash flows from operations also are impacted by changes in working capital 
we generally maintain low cash and cash equivalent balances because we use available funds to fund our development activities or reduce our bank debt 
short term liquidity needs are satisfied by borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we generally use derivatives to economically hedge a significant  but varying portion of our anticipated future oil production for the next to months 
any payments due to counterparties under our derivative contracts are funded by proceeds received from the sale of our production 
production receipts  however  lag payments to the counterparties 
any interim cash needs are funded by cash from operations or borrowings under the credit facility 
as of december   we had entered into derivative agreements covering million barrels for and million barrels for for additional information on the impact of changing prices on our financial position  see item a

the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended december  as compared to was primarily the result of an increase in crude oil and natural gas production of 
in addition  at december   we had a working capital surplus of million which was primarily attributable to higher cash and short term investments balances as a result of the proceeds from the sale of common stock 
cash flows provided by operating activities during the year ended december  increased compared to primarily as a result of an increase in crude oil and natural gas production of 
cash flows used in investing activities we had cash flows used in investing activities of million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively  primarily as a result of our capital expenditures for drilling  development and acquisition costs 
the increase in cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  compared to of million was attributable to our acquisitions of properties in the williston basin  as well as increased levels of development of our properties 
during  we increased our net well count as compared to our net well count by 
in  we added net wells to reach net wells at year end 
as a result of the increased development activities  the company sold million of short term investments to fund the drilling  development and acquisition costs 
the million increase in cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  compared to december  was attributable to drilling  development and acquisition costs 
during  we increased our net well count as compared to our net well count by 
in  we added net wells to reach net wells at the end of also  in we increased our short term investments by million as we temporarily re invested proceeds from the sale of common stock 
cash flows provided by financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
for the year ended december   we received million in net advances under our revolving credit facility that were used to fund drilling  development and acquisition costs 
for the years ended december  and  cash increased through financing activities was primarily provided by net proceeds from the sale of common stock 
revolving credit facility as of december   we maintained a million revolving credit facility that is secured by substantially all of our assets with a maturity of may  we had million of borrowings under this credit facility at december  at december   we had a borrowing base of million  subject to a million aggregate maximum credit amount that provided million of additional borrowing capacity under this facility 
for additional information  see note in our notes to the financial statements 
on february   we entered into an amended and restated revolving credit facility  which replaced our previous revolving credit facility 
the new facility  secured by substantially all of our assets  provides for an initial commitment equal to the lesser of the facility amount or the borrowing base 
at closing  the facility amount was million and provided for a million borrowing base 
the new credit facility provides for a borrowing base subject to redetermination semi annually each april and october and for event driven unscheduled redeterminations 
the new bank group is comprised of a group of commercial banks  with no single bank holding more than of the total facility 
as of february   the outstanding balance under the credit facility was million leaving million of borrowing capacity available under the facility 
the loan matures on january  borrowings under the bank facility can either be at the alternate base rate as defined plus a spread ranging from to or libor borrowings at the adjusted libor rate as defined plus a spread ranging from to 
the applicable spread is dependent upon borrowings relative to the borrowing base 
we may elect  from time to time  to convert all or any part of our libor loans to base rate loans or to convert all or any of the base rate loans to libor loans 
a commitment fee is paid on the undrawn balance based on an annual rate of to 
at closing  the commitment fee was and the interest rate margin was on our libor loans and on our base rate loans 
the facility contains negative covenants that limit our ability  among other things  to pay cash dividends  incur additional indebtedness  sell assets  enter into certain hedging contracts  change the nature of our business or operations  merge  consolidate  or make certain types of investments 
in addition  we are required to maintain a ratio of debt to ebitdax as defined in the credit agreement of no greater than to  a current ratio as defined in the credit agreement of no less than to and a ratio of ebitdax to interest expense of no less than to we were in compliance with our covenants under the credit facility at december  capital requirements our primary needs for cash are for exploration  development and acquisition of crude oil and natural gas properties and payment of interest on outstanding indebtedness 
during  approximately million of capital was incurred on drilling projects 
also in  approximately million was expended on acreage acquisitions located in the williston basin 
our capital program was funded by cash on hand  net cash flow from operations and borrowings under our credit facility 
our capital expenditure budget for is currently set at million  excluding acquisitions 
development and acquisition activities are highly discretionary  and  for the near term  we expect such activities to be maintained at levels equal to internal cash flow and borrowing under our revolving credit facility 
to the extent capital requirements exceed internal cash flow and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility  debt or equity may be issued to fund these requirements 
we monitor our capital expenditures on a regular basis  adjusting the amount up or down and also between our projects  depending on commodity prices  cash flow and projected returns 
also  our obligations may change due to acquisitions  divestitures and continued growth 
we may issue additional shares of stock  subordinated notes or other debt securities to fund capital expenditures  acquisitions  extend maturities or to repay debt 
the forward looking statements about our capital budget are based on current expectations  estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance 
actual results may differ materially from these expectations  estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks  uncertainties and other factors  some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict 
some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include prices of and demand for crude oil and natural gas  actions of competitors  disruptions or interruptions of our production and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions  acts of war or terrorists acts and the government or military response  and other operating and economic considerations 
satisfaction of our cash obligations for the next months with the addition of our amended and restated credit facility in february and our cash flows from operations  we believe we have sufficient capital to meet our drilling commitments and expected general and administrative expenses for the next twelve months 
nonetheless  any strategic acquisition of assets or increase in drilling activity may require us to seek additional capital 
we may also choose to seek additional capital rather than utilize our credit facility or other debt instruments to fund accelerated or continued drilling at the discretion of management and depending on prevailing market conditions 
we will evaluate any potential opportunities for acquisitions as they arise 
however  there can be no assurance that any additional capital will be available to us on favorable terms or at all 
over the next months it is possible that our existing capital  our revolving credit facility and anticipated funds from operations may not be sufficient to sustain continued acreage acquisitions and drilling activities 
consequently  we may seek additional capital in the future to fund growth and expansion through additional equity or debt financing or credit facilities 
no assurance can be made that such financing would be available  and if available it may take either the form of debt or equity 
in either case  the financing could have a negative impact on our financial condition and our shareholders 
though we achieved profitability in and remained profitable throughout  and  our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stage of operations  particularly companies in the crude oil and natural gas exploration industry 
such risks include  but are not limited to  an evolving and unpredictable business model and the management of growth 
to address these risks we must  among other things  implement and successfully execute our business strategy  continue to develop and upgrade our technology  respond to competitive developments  and attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing such risks  and the failure to do so can have a material adverse effect on our business prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
effects of inflation and pricing the crude oil and natural gas industry is very cyclical and the demand for goods and services of crude oil field companies  suppliers and others associated with the industry put extreme pressure on the economic stability and pricing structure within the industry 
typically  as prices for crude oil and natural gas increase  so do all associated costs 
conversely  in a period of declining prices  associated cost declines are likely to lag and may not adjust downward in proportion 
material changes in prices also impact our current revenue stream  estimates of future reserves  borrowing base calculations of bank loans  impairment assessments of crude oil and natural gas properties  and values of properties in purchase and sale transactions 
material changes in prices can impact the value of crude oil and natural gas companies and their ability to raise capital  borrow money and retain personnel 
while we do not currently expect business costs to materially increase  higher prices for crude oil and natural gas could result in increases in the costs of materials  services and personnel 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our obligations and commitments at december  to make future payments under certain contracts  aggregated by category of contractual obligation  for specified time periods payment due by period contractual obligations less than year years years more than years total office lease automobile leases derivative liability long term debt cash interest expense on debt total office lease through automobile leases for certain executives through swap contracts and costless collars see note to financial statements revolving credit facility see note to financial statements cash interest on revolving credit facility is estimated assuming no principal repayment until the due date product research and development we do not anticipate performing any significant research and development given our current plan of operation 
expected purchase or sale of any significant equipment we do not anticipate the purchase or sale of any plant or significant equipment as such items are not required by us at this time or anticipated to be needed in the next twelve months 
critical accounting policies the establishment and consistent application of accounting policies is a vital component of accurately and fairly presenting our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap  as well as ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations governing financial reporting 
while there are rarely alternative methods or rules from which to select in establishing accounting and financial reporting policies  proper application often involves significant judgment regarding a given set of facts and circumstances and a complex series of decisions 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements under gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our estimates of our proved crude oil and natural gas reserves  future development costs  estimates relating to certain crude oil and natural gas revenues and expenses and fair value of derivative instruments are the most critical to our financial statements 
crude oil and natural gas reserves the determination of depreciation  depletion and amortization expense as well as impairments that are recognized on our crude oil and natural gas properties are highly dependent on the estimates of the proved crude oil and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties 
our estimate of proved reserves is based on the quantities of crude oil and natural gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable in the future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation  and judgment 
for example  we must estimate the amount and timing of future operating costs  production taxes and development costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
in addition  as the prices of crude oil and natural gas and cost levels change from year to year  the economics of producing our reserves may change and therefore the estimate of proved reserves may also change 
any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves 
the information regarding present value of the future net cash flows attributable to our proved crude oil and natural gas reserves are estimates only and should not be construed as the current market value of the estimated crude oil and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties 
thus  such information includes revisions of certain reserve estimates attributable to our properties included in the prior year s estimates 
these revisions reflect additional information from subsequent activities  production history of the properties involved and any adjustments in the projected economic life of such properties resulting from changes in crude oil and natural gas prices 
any future downward revisions could adversely affect our financial condition  our borrowing ability  our future prospects and the value of our common stock 
the estimates of our proved crude oil and natural gas reserves used in the preparation of our financial statements were prepared by ryder scott company  our registered independent petroleum consultants  and were prepared in accordance with the rules promulgated by the sec 
crude oil and natural gas properties the method of accounting we use to account for our crude oil and natural gas investments determines what costs are capitalized and how these costs are ultimately matched with revenues and expensed 
we utilize the full cost method of accounting to account for our crude oil and natural gas investments instead of the successful efforts method because we believe it more accurately reflects the underlying economics of our programs to explore and develop crude oil and natural gas reserves 
the full cost method embraces the concept that dry holes and other expenditures that fail to add reserves are intrinsic to the crude oil and natural gas exploration business 
thus  under the full cost method  all costs incurred in connection with the acquisition  development and exploration of crude oil and natural gas reserves are capitalized 
these capitalized amounts include the costs of unproved properties  internal costs directly related to acquisitions  development and exploration activities  asset retirement costs  geological and geophysical costs that are directly attributable to the properties and capitalized interest 
although some of these costs will ultimately result in no additional reserves  they are part of a program from which we expect the benefits of successful wells to more than offset the costs of any unsuccessful ones 
the full cost method differs from the successful efforts method of accounting for crude oil and natural gas investments 
the primary difference between these two methods is the treatment of exploratory dry hole costs 
these costs are generally expensed under the successful efforts method when it is determined that measurable reserves do not exist 
geological and geophysical costs are also expensed under the successful efforts method 
under the full cost method  both dry hole costs and geological and geophysical costs are initially capitalized and classified as unproved properties pending determination of proved reserves 
if no proved reserves are discovered  these costs are then amortized with all the costs in the full cost pool 
capitalized amounts except unproved costs are depleted using the units of production method 
the depletion expense per unit of production is the ratio of the sum of our unamortized historical costs and estimated future development costs to our proved reserve volumes 
estimation of hydrocarbon reserves relies on professional judgment and use of factors that cannot be precisely determined 
subsequent reserve estimates materially different from those reported would change the depletion expense recognized during the future reporting periods 
for the year ended december   our average depletion expense per unit of production was per boe 
a decrease in our estimated net proved reserves at december  would result in a per boe increase in our per unit depletion 
to the extent the capitalized costs in our full cost pool net of depreciation  depletion and amortization and related deferred taxes exceed the sum of the present value using a discount rate and based on period end crude oil and natural gas prices of the estimated future net cash flows from our proved crude oil and natural gas reserves and the capitalized cost associated with our unproved properties  we would have a capitalized ceiling impairment 
such costs would be charged to operations as a reduction of the carrying value of crude oil and natural gas properties 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our crude oil and natural gas properties increases when crude oil and natural gas prices are depressed  even if the low prices are temporary 
in addition  capitalized ceiling impairment charges may occur if we experience poor drilling results or estimations of our proved reserves are substantially reduced 
a capitalized ceiling impairment is a reduction in earnings that does not impact cash flows  but does impact operating income and shareholders equity 
once recognized  a capitalized ceiling impairment charge to crude oil and natural gas properties cannot be reversed at a later date 
the risk that we will experience a ceiling test writedown increases when crude oil and natural gas prices are depressed or if we have substantial downward revisions in our estimated proved reserves 
as of december  we have not incurred a capitalized ceiling impairment charge 
however  no assurance can be given that we will not experience a capitalized ceiling impairment charge in future periods 
in addition  capitalized ceiling impairment charges may occur if estimates of proved hydrocarbon reserves are substantially reduced or estimates of future development costs increase significantly 
revenue recognition we derive revenue primarily from the sale of the crude oil and natural gas from our interests in producing wells  hence our revenue recognition policy for these sales is significant 
we recognize revenue from the sale of crude oil and natural gas when production is delivered to  and title has transferred to  the purchaser and to the extent the selling price is reasonably determinable 
we use the sales method of accounting for natural gas balancing of natural gas production and would recognize a liability if the existing proved reserves were not adequate to cover the current imbalance situation 
as of december     and  our natural gas production was in balance  meaning its cumulative portion of natural gas production taken and sold from wells in which it has an interest equaled its entitled interest in natural gas production from those wells 
in general  settlements for hydrocarbon sales occur around two months after the end of the month in which the crude oil  natural gas or other hydrocarbon products were produced 
we estimate and accrue for the value of these sales using information available to us at the time our financial statements are generated 
differences are reflected in the accounting period that payments are received from the operator 
derivative instruments and hedging activities we use derivative instruments from time to time to manage market risks resulting from fluctuations in the prices of crude oil and natural gas 
we may periodically enter into derivative contracts  including price swaps  caps and floors  which require payments to or receipts from counterparties based on the differential between a fixed price and a variable price for a fixed quantity of crude oil or natural gas without the exchange of underlying volumes 
the notional amounts of these financial instruments are based on expected production from existing wells 
we have  and may continue to use exchange traded futures contracts and option contracts to hedge the delivery price of crude oil at a future date 
on november   due to the volatility of price differentials in the williston basin  we de designated all derivatives that were previously classified as cash flow hedges and in addition  we have elected not to designate any subsequent derivative contracts as accounting hedges 
as such  all derivative positions are carried at their fair value on the balance sheet and are marked to market at the end of each period 
any realized gains and losses are recorded to gain loss on settled derivatives and unrealized gains or losses are recorded to gain loss on mark to market of derivative instruments on the statement of income rather than as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss or other income expense 
see note for a description of the derivative contracts which the company executed during and prior to november   at the inception of a derivative contract  we designated the derivative as a cash flow hedge 
for all derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  we formally documented the relationship between the derivative contract and the hedged items  as well as the risk management objective for entering into the derivative contract 
to be designated as a cash flow hedge transaction  the relationship between the derivative and the hedged items must be highly effective in achieving the offset of changes in cash flows attributable to the risk both at the inception of the derivative and on an ongoing basis 
we historically measured hedge effectiveness on a quarterly basis and hedge accounting would be discontinued prospectively if it determined that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item 
gains and losses deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income related to cash flow hedge derivatives that become ineffective remain unchanged until the related production is delivered 
if we determine that it is probable that a hedged forecasted transaction will not occur  deferred gains or losses on the derivative are recognized in earnings immediately 
derivatives  historically  were recorded on the balance sheet at fair value and changes in the fair value of derivatives were recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative was designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if it was  depending on the type of hedge transaction 
our derivatives historically consisted primarily of cash flow hedge transactions in which we were hedging the variability of cash flows related to a forecasted transaction 
period to period changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges were reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and reclassified to earnings in the periods in which the hedged item impacts earnings 
the ineffective portion of the cash flow hedges were reflected in current period earnings as gain or loss from derivatives 
gains and losses on derivative instruments that did not qualify for hedge accounting were included in income or loss from derivatives in the period in which they occur 
the resulting cash flows from derivatives were reported as cash flows from operating activities 
new accounting pronouncements presentation of comprehensive income in june  the fasb issued comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income asu no 

the guidance eliminates the option of presenting components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of stockholders equity 
the standard will allow us the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in december  the fasb issued comprehensive income topic deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 
asu no 

the fasb indefinitely deferred the effective date for the guidance related to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented 
the standard  except for the portion that was indefinitely deferred  is effective for us on january   and must be applied retrospectively 
we are evaluating the effects of this standard on disclosure  but it will not impact our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss in may  the fasb issued fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs asu no 

the standard generally clarifies the application of existing requirements on topics including the concepts of highest and best use and valuation premise and disclosing quantitative information about the unobservable inputs used in the measurement of instruments categorized within level of the fair value hierarchy 
additionally  the standard includes changes on topics such as measuring fair value of financial instruments that are managed within a portfolio and additional disclosure for fair value measurements categorized within level of the fair value hierarchy 
this standard is effective for us on january  the standard will require additional disclosures  but it will not impact our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
balance sheet offsetting in december  the fasb issued balance sheet topic disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities asu no 
 which updates the codification to require disclosures regarding netting arrangements in agreements underlying derivatives  certain financial instruments and related collateral amounts  and the extent to which an entity s financial statement presentation policies related to netting arrangements impact amounts recorded to the financial statements 
these updates to the disclosure requirements of the codification do not affect the presentation of amounts in the balance sheet  and are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january   and interim periods within those periods 
the company does not expect the implementation of this disclosure guidance to have a material impact on its financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted for a description of the accounting standards that we adopted in  see notes to financial statements note significant accounting policies 
various accounting standards and interpretations were issued in with effective dates subsequent to december  we have evaluated the recently issued accounting pronouncements that are effective in and believe that none of them will have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows when adopted 
further  we are monitoring the joint standard setting efforts of the financial accounting standards board and the international accounting standards board 
there are a large number of pending accounting standards that are being targeted for completion in and beyond  including  but not limited to  standards relating to revenue recognition  accounting for leases  fair value measurements  accounting for financial instruments  disclosure of loss contingencies and financial statement presentation 
because these pending standards have not yet been finalized  at this time we are not able to determine the potential future impact that these standards will have  if any  on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
off balance sheet arrangements we currently do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk the price we receive for our crude oil and natural gas production heavily influences our revenue  profitability  access to capital and future rate of growth 
crude oil and natural gas are commodities and  therefore  their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand 
historically  the markets for crude oil and natural gas have been volatile  and our management believes these markets will likely continue to be volatile in the future 
the prices we receive for our production depend on numerous factors beyond our control 
our revenue during generally would have increased or decreased along with any increases or decreases in crude oil or natural gas prices  but the exact impact on our income is indeterminable given the variety of expenses associated with producing and selling crude oil that also increase and decrease along with crude oil prices 
we have previously entered into derivative contracts to achieve a more predictable cash flow by reducing our exposure to crude oil and natural gas price volatility 
on november   due to the volatility of price differentials in the williston basin  we de designated all derivatives that were previously classified as cash flow hedges and in addition  we have elected not to designate any subsequent derivative contracts as accounting hedges 
as such  all derivative positions are carried at their fair value on the balance sheet and are marked to market at the end of each period 
any realized gains and losses are recorded to gain loss on settled derivatives and unrealized gains or losses are recorded to gain loss on mark to market of derivative instruments on the statement of income rather than as a component of other comprehensive income loss or other income expense 
the following table reflects the weighted average price of open commodity swap contracts as of december   by year with associated volumes 
weighted average price of open commodity swap contracts year volumes bbl weighted average price subsequent to december   we had entered into an additional commodity swap contract 
the crude oil swap contract is for  barrels of crude oil with a settlement period in january the price on the contract is fixed at per barrel 
in addition to the open commodity swap contracts we have entered into costless collars 
the costless collars are used to establish floor and ceiling prices on anticipated crude oil and natural gas production 
there were no premiums paid or received by us related to the costless collar agreements 
the following table reflects the weighted average price of open costless collar contracts as of december   by year with associated volumes 
weighted average price of open costless collar contracts year volumes bbl weighted average price as of february   we had entered into three additional costless collar contracts 
the crude oil collars included  barrels of crude oil with an average floor of and an average ceiling of 
the settlement periods are between february and december interest rate risk we had million in outstanding borrowings at an average rate of under our revolving credit facility as of december  we have the option to designate the reference rate of interest for each specific borrowing under the credit facility as amounts are advanced 
borrowings based upon the london interbank offered rate libor will bear interest at a rate equal to libor plus a spread ranging from to depending on the percentage of borrowing base that is currently advanced 
any borrowings not designated as being based upon libor will bear interest at a rate equal to the current prime rate published by the wall street journal  plus a spread ranging from to  depending on the percentage of borrowing base that is currently advanced 
we have the option to designate either pricing mechanism 
interest payments are due under the credit facility in arrears  in the case of a loan based on libor on the last day of the specified interest period and in the case of all other loans on the last day of each march  june  september and december 
all outstanding principal is due and payable upon termination of the credit facility 
our credit facility allows us to fix the interest rate of borrowings under it for all or a portion of the principal balance for a period up to three months  however our borrowings are generally withdrawn with interest rates fixed for one month 
thereafter  to the extent we do not repay the principle  our borrowings are rolled over and the interest rate is reset based on the current libor or prime rate as applicable 
as a result  changes in interest rates can impact results of operations and cash flows 
a increase in short term interest rates on the floating rate debt outstanding at december  would cost us approximately million in additional annual interest expense
