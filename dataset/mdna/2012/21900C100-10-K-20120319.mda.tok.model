item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the following discussion and analysis together with our audited financial statements and the accompanying notes 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  within the meaning of section a of securities act  section e of the exchange act  and the private securities litigation reform act of  including statements regarding our expected financial position  business and financing plans 
these statements involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report  particularly under the headings forward looking statements and risk factors 
overview we are a development stage pharmaceutical and medical device company that seeks to in license  develop and commercialize therapeutic products for the treatment of cardiac and renal dysfunction  specifically in the dialysis and non dialysis areas 
we have the worldwide rights to develop and commercialize proprietary product candidates that address large market opportunities  which includes crmd neutrolin and crmd crmd is a liquid designed to prevent central venous catheter related bloodstream infections or crbi and maintenance of catheter patency in central venous catheters initially in hemodialysis catheters 
during the second quarter  we submitted our design dossier for a ce marking approval in europe 
we are a development stage company 
we were organized as a delaware corporation on july  under the name picton holding company  inc and we changed our corporate name to cormedix inc 
on january  since our inception  we have had no revenue from product sales 
our operations have been primarily limited to organizing and staffing  licensing product candidates  developing clinical trials for our product candidates  establishing manufacturing for our product candidates and maintaining and improving our patent portfolio 
we have generated significant losses since our inception and we expect to continue to generate losses as we progress towards the commercialization of our product candidates  including crmd and previously crmd as of december   we had a deficit accumulated during the development stage of  because we do not generate revenue from any of our product candidates  our losses will continue as we advance our product candidates towards regulatory approval and eventual commercialization 
as a result  our operating losses are likely to be substantial over the next several years 
we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when we will become profitable  if at all 
these matters raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
in march  we completed our ipo  whereby we sold  units  each unit consisting of two shares of our common stock and a warrant to purchase one share of common stock  at per unit resulting in gross proceeds of  and net proceeds to us of  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us 
all of our convertible notes and accrued interest thereon and all of our outstanding shares of non voting subordinated class a common stock automatically converted into units or common stock upon the completion of the ipo 
we believe that the net proceeds from the ipo and existing cash will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements into the fourth quarter of we also effected a for reverse stock split of our common stock on february  in connection with the ipo 
all shares and per share amounts  except as noted  have been retroactively adjusted to give effect to the reverse stock split 
financial operations overview revenue we have not generated any revenue since our inception 
as of december   we have funded our operations primarily through debt financings and the ipo  and our receipt of a total of approximately  from federal grants under the qualifying therapeutic discovery project program  a total of approximately  from the sale of our unused net operating losses through the state of new jersey s economic development authority technology business tax certificate transfer program and approximately  from the state of new york s research and development tax credit program 
if our product development efforts result in clinical success  regulatory approval and successful commercialization of any of our products  we could generate revenue from sales or licenses of any such products 
research and development expense research and development  or r d expense consists of i internal costs associated with our development activities  ii payments we make to third party contract research organizations  contract manufacturers  investigative sites  and consultants  iii technology and intellectual property license costs  iv manufacturing development costs  v personnel related expenses  including salaries  stock based compensation  benefits  travel and related costs for the personnel involved in drug development  vi activities relating to regulatory filings and the advancement of our product candidates through preclinical studies and clinical trials  and vii facilities and other allocated expenses  which include direct and allocated expenses for rent  facility maintenance  as well as laboratory and other supplies 
all r d is expensed as incurred 
conducting a significant amount of development is central to our business model 
through december   we incurred  in r d expenses since our inception in july product candidates in later stage clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of development  primarily due to the significantly increased size and duration of the clinical trials 
we plan to increase our r d expenses for the foreseeable future in order to complete development of crmd and our earlier stage r d projects 
the following table summarizes the percentages of our r d payments related to our two most advanced product candidates and other projects 
the percentages summarized in the following table reflect payments directly attributable to each development candidate  which are tracked on a project basis 
a portion of our internal costs  including indirect costs relating to our product candidates  are not tracked on a project basis and are allocated based on management s estimate 
year ended december  period from july  inception through december  crmd crmd crmd crmd the process of conducting pre clinical studies and clinical trials necessary to obtain fda approval is costly and time consuming 
the probability of success for each product candidate and clinical trial may be affected by a variety of factors  including  among others  the quality of the product candidate s early clinical data  investment in the program  competition  manufacturing capabilities and commercial viability 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  the uncertainty associated with clinical trial enrollments and the risks inherent in the development process  we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of current or future clinical stages of our product candidates or when  or to what extent  we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates 
development timelines  probability of success and development costs vary widely 
we have decided to focus the majority of our resources and research and development efforts on seeking ce marking approval and commercialization of neutrolin in europe through a ce mark application 
during the first half of we submitted our design dossier with t v s d the european notified body managing our ce mark application 
in the fourth quarter we successfully completed our stage audit with t v 
upon the successful completion of the stage audit and the implementation and approval of our quality management system and approval our design dossier  we would anticipate being in a position to obtain a ce mark approval in the first half of if we obtain ce mark approval in europe  we intend to be in a position to launch neutrolin for the prevention of catheter related bloodstream infections  or crbi and maintenance of catheter patency in hemodialysis patients in europe during we cannot be assured of ce mark approval of neutrolin on that timeline or at all 
we are currently exploring the various methods of launching neutrolin in europe  whether through a distributorship or partnership arrangement or otherwise 
general and administrative expense general and administrative  or g a expense consists primarily of salaries and other related costs  including stock based compensation expense  for persons serving in our executive  finance and accounting functions 
other g a expense includes facility related costs not otherwise included in r d expense  promotional expenses  costs associated with industry and trade shows  and professional fees for legal services and accounting services 
we expect that our g a expenses will increase if we add personnel and as a result of the reporting obligations applicable to public companies 
from our inception on july  through december   we incurred  of g a expense 
other income other income consists mainly of federal research grants awarded and research and development tax refunds  net of application fees 
from our inception on july  through december   we received  of other income  net of application fees and related filing costs 
interest income and interest expense interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents 
interest expense consists of interest incurred on our convertible notes up to their automatic conversion into units or common stock upon the completion of the ipo on march   as well as the amortization and write off of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and a charge for the beneficial conversion relating to certain of our convertible notes 
from our inception on july  through december   we received  of interest income through interest bearing savings accounts and incurred  of interest expense  which consists of interest incurred in debt issued to noteholders  amortization and write off of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and a beneficial conversion feature charge related to the conversion of certain of our convertible notes 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and december  r d expense 
r d expense was  for the year ended december   a decrease of  from  for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributed to the march  issuance of  shares of our common stock  of which  shares are held in escrow  to our licensors valued at per share  or  as a result of anti dilution adjustments in connection with the conversion of our outstanding convertible debt to common stock upon the closing of the ipo  which anti dilution provisions have expired 
the decrease in r d expense was partially offset by increased clinical development costs related to our phase ii clinical trial of crmd that began in june  higher manufacturing and regulatory costs related the development of crmd and costs related to the hiring of two employees in the areas of clinical operations and product development during the third quarter of g a expense 
g a expense was  for the year ended december   an increase of  from  for the year ended december  the increase in g a expense reflects increased officer and director compensation costs in addition to costs associated with operating as a publicly traded company following the ipo in march  which include filing fees related to the listing of our common stock 
other income 
other income was  for the year ended december   a decrease of  from  for the year ended december  other income during represented a research and development funding reimbursement from the state of new york research and development tax refund program and in represented federal grants  net of filing and application fees we received under the qualifying therapeutic discovery project program 
interest income and interest expense 
interest income was  for the year ended december   a decrease of  from  for the year ended december  the decrease was attributable to having lower interest bearing cash balances during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  interest expense was for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  interest expense charges related to the conversion of all our convertible notes  of which the aggregate amount of principal and accrued interest as of march  was  in connection with the ipo 
the interest expense charges consisted primarily of a beneficial conversion feature charge of  related to the discount at which the senior convertible notes we issued in october and november in the aggregate principal amount of  the third bridge notes  converted into common stock  a write off of debt discount of  in and a write off of the remaining amortization of deferred financing fees of  in liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity as a result of our significant research and development expenditures and the lack of any approved products to generate product sales revenue  we have not been profitable and have generated operating losses since we were incorporated in july prior to the ipo  we had funded our operations principally with  in convertible notes sold in private placements and  in related party notes  which were also convertible 
we received net proceeds of  from the ipo  after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and offering expenses payable by us upon the closing of the ipo on march  all of our convertible notes were automatically converted into  shares of common stock and  units comprised of  shares of common stock and  warrants at an exercise price of 
we also received a total of approximately  from federal grants under the qualifying therapeutic discovery project program  a total of approximately  from the sale of our unused net operating losses through the state of new jersey s economic development authority technology business tax certificate transfer program and approximately  from the state of new york s research and development tax credit program 
net cash used in operating activities net cash used in operating activities was  for the year ended december  the net loss of  for the year ended december  was higher than cash used in operating activities by  the primary reasons for the difference are non cash stock based compensation charges of  offset by decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of  and  respectively  relating primarily to clinical research organization costs  clinical site costs  manufacturing costs  patent fees and accrued legal fees 
net cash used in operating activities was  for the year ended december  the net loss of  for the year ended december  was higher than cash used in operating activities by  the primary reasons for the difference are the stock issued in connection with our license agreements anti dilution provisions of stock issuances of  which provisions expired upon the completion of our ipo in march  the charge for the beneficial conversion feature related to the third bridge notes of  non cash interest expense of  on our outstanding debt during the first quarter of  the write offs of debt discount and deferred financing costs of  and  respectively  as a result of the conversion of our notes  stock based compensation charges of  an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of  and  respectively  relating primarily to clinical research organization costs  manufacturing costs  patent fees  accrued legal fees  accounting fees  bonuses and filing fees 
net cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities consisted of a purchase of computer equipment during net cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities consisted of leasehold improvements made to our corporate headquarters located in bridgewater  new jersey  in addition to purchases of computer equipment and accounting software  which are being amortized over the term of the lease and depreciated over the expected life of the equipment and software 
net cash provided by financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  net cash provided by financing activities consisted of the sale of equity securities issued in our ipo  through which we received gross proceeds of  the gross proceeds of  were offset by underwriting discounts and commissions of  corporate finance fees of  and reimbursable legal fees for counsel to the underwriters of  in addition to other offering costs and expenses of  consisting primarily of legal  accounting  printing and filing fees 
funding requirements our total cash on hand as of december  was  compared to  at december  because our business does not generate positive operating cash flow  we will need to raise additional capital before we exhaust our current cash resources in order to continue to fund our research and development  including our long term plans for clinical trials and new product development  as well as to fund operations generally 
our continued operations will depend on whether we are able to raise additional funds through various potential sources  such as equity  debt financing  strategic relationships  out licensing or distribution arrangements of our products 
through december   all of our financing has been through our ipo  previous debt financings and our receipt of a total of approximately  from federal grants under the qualifying therapeutic discovery project program  a total of approximately  from the sale of our unused net operating losses through the state of new jersey s economic development authority technology business tax certificate transfer program and approximately  from the state of new york s research and development tax credit program  net of application fees 
we expect to continue to fund operations from cash on hand and through either capital raising sources as previously described  which may be dilutive to existing stockholders  or through generating revenues from the licensing of our products or strategic alliances 
we plan to seek additional debt and or equity financing  but can provide no assurances that such financing will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
moreover  the incurrence of indebtedness in connection with a debt financing would result in increased fixed obligations and could also result in covenants that would restrict our operations 
our actual cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned  however  because of a number of factors including the changes in the focus and direction of our research and development programs  the acquisition and pursuit of development of new product candidates  competitive and technical advances  costs of commercializing any of our product candidates  and costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and any other intellectual property rights 
we do not anticipate that we will generate significant product sales revenue for in the absence of additional funding  we expect our continuing operating losses to result in increases in our cash used in operations over the next several quarters 
based on our cash resources at december   and our current plan of expenditure on continuing development of our current products  we believe that we have sufficient capital to fund our operations into the fourth quarter of  and will need additional financing until we can achieve profitability  if ever 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when needed  we may not be able to market our products as planned or continue development and regulatory approval of our products  or we could be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs 
each of these alternatives would likely have a material adverse effect on the prospects of our business 
these matters raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
critical accounting policies our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates and judgments  including those described below 
we base our estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results and experiences may differ materially from these estimates 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements included with this report  we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and affect the more significant judgments and estimates that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 
stock based compensation we account for stock options according to the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc no 
 compensation stock compensation asc 
under asc  share based compensation cost is measured at grant date  based on the estimated fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the employee s requisite service period on a straight line basis 
we account for stock options granted to non employees on a fair value basis using the black scholes option pricing method in accordance with asc the non cash charge to operations for non employee options with vesting are revalued at the end of each reporting period based upon the change in the fair value of the options and amortized to consulting expense over the related vesting period 
we granted options to purchase  shares of common stock to our employees  non employees and directors and officers during the year ended december  for the purpose of valuing options and warrants granted to the company s employees  directors and officers during the year ended december   the company used the black scholes option pricing model 
for the purpose of valuing performance based options granted to a non employee during the year ended december   the company used the standard monte carlo stock price simulation method 
as of december   there were no non employee stock options that have vested  as the vesting of such stock options was contingent upon various performance metrics that were not achieved as of december  to estimate the number of stock options expected to vest  the company used the monte carlo stock price simulation method 
the monte carlo analysis uses several random simulations along with performance vesting metrics  an initial stock price of  expected volatility of for the one year period of the vesting contingency and a one year risk free rate of 
the company then used the results of the monte carlo analysis together with the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the options issued 
to determine the risk free interest rate  the company utilized the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant with a term consistent with the expected term of our awards 
the company estimated the expected term of the options granted based on anticipated exercises in future periods assuming the success of the company s business model as currently forecasted 
the expected dividend yield reflects the company s current and expected future policy for dividends on the company s common stock 
the expected stock price volatility for the stock options was calculated by examining historical volatilities for publicly traded industry peers  since the company does not have a significant trading history for our common stock 
the company will continue to analyze the expected stock price volatility and expected term assumptions as more historical data for its common stock becomes available 
the company has experienced forfeitures of stock options issued to its former president and chief executive officer  chief medical officer  chairman and board member 
since the stock options currently outstanding are primarily held by the company s senior management and directors  the company will continue to evaluate the effects of such future potential forfeitures  as they may arise  to ascertain an estimated forfeiture rate 
accounting standards updates in december  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities  which requires entities to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements of financial instruments and derivative instruments 
the update requires new disclosures about balance sheet offsetting and related arrangements 
for derivatives and financial assets and liabilities  the amendments require disclosure of gross asset and liability amounts  amounts offset on the balance sheet  and amounts subject to the offsetting requirements but not offset on the balance sheet 
the guidance is effective beginning on or after january   and interim periods within those annual periods and is to be applied retrospectively 
this guidance does not amend the existing guidance on when it is appropriate to offset  as a result  we do not expect this guidance to affect our financial condition  results of operation or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued asu to address questions concerning how pharmaceutical manufacturers should recognize and classify in their income statements fees mandated by the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act 
the legislation imposes an annual fee on the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry for each calendar year beginning on or after january  an entity s portion of the annual fee is payable no later than september of the applicable calendar year and is not tax deductible 
pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers with less than million in annual sales are exempt from the annual fee 
the adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
other asus not effective until after december  are not expected to have a significant effect on our financial position or results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements
