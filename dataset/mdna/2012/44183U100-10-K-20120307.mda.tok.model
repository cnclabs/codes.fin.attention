item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are an independent energy company focused on the development  exploration  exploitation  acquisition  and production of natural gas and crude oil properties in the us gulf coast region and in south america 
our oil and gas reserves and operations are concentrated primarily in the south american country of colombia and in the onshore gulf coast region  particularly texas and louisiana 
our mission is to deliver outstanding net asset value per share growth to our investors via attractive oil and gas investments 
our strategy is to focus on early identification of  and entrance into  existing and emerging resource plays  particularly in south america and the us gulf coast 
we typically seek to partner with larger operators in development of resources or retain interests  with or without contribution on our part  in prospects identified  packaged and promoted to larger operators 
by entering these plays earlier and partnering with  or promoting to  larger operators  we believe we can capture larger resource potential at lower cost and minimize our exposure to drilling risks and costs and ongoing operating costs 
we  along with our partners  actively manage our resources through opportunistic acquisitions and divestitures where reserves can be identified  developed  monetized and financial resources redeployed with the objective of growing reserves  production and shareholder value 
generally  we generate nearly all our revenues and cash flows from the sale of produced natural gas and crude oil  whether through royalty interests  working interests or other arrangements 
we may also realize gains and additional cash flows from the periodic divestiture of assets 
recent developments production levels  revenues and profitability sale of hdc  llc and hl  llc our production levels  revenues and profitability during  as compared to  were adversely affected by the sale  in late  of our interest in certain prospects and producing properties located in colombia 
in december  hupecol dorotea cabiona holdings  llc hupecol d c holdings and hupecol llanos holdings  llc hupecol llanos holdings sold all of their interests in hupecol dorotea and cabiona  llc hdc  llc and hupecol llanos  llc hl  llc 
we own interests in each of hupecol d c holdings and hupecol llanos holdings and  in turn  held indirect equivalent interests in each of hdc  llc and hl  llc  which companies hold interests in the dorotea  cabiona  leona and las garzas blocks and related assets in colombia 
hdc  llc sold for million and hl  llc sold for million  each subject to certain closing adjustments based on operations between the june  effective date and the closing date 
fifteen percent of the sales price of each of hdc  llc and hl  llc was held in escrow to fund potential claims arising from the sale  with escrowed amounts to be released over a three year period based on amounts remaining in escrow after any claims 
in addition to the fifteen percent escrowed  hupecol llc hupecol withheld of the proceeds in escrow for any contingencies that may arise from the transactions 
during  we received a partial payment of  from hupecol for the contingency withheld related to hl  llc 
pursuant to our ownership interest in each of hupecol d c holdings and hupecol llanos holdings  we received in the net sale proceeds after deduction of commissions and transaction expenses from each sale and subject to the escrow hold back 
following completion of the sale of hdc  llc and hl  llc  we had no continuing interest in the dorotea  cabiona  leona and las garzas blocks 
during  respectively  the dorotea  cabiona  leona and las garzas blocks accounted for approximately  barrels of oil net to our interest produced  or of our total production  and  of revenues 
during  proceeds from the sale were redeployed principally to exploration costs associated with our cpo prospect in colombia and  to a lesser extent  other hupecol operated prospects 
we are substantially dependent upon the results of our ongoing drilling program in colombia  particularly our cpo prospect  to replace  and grow  the reserves  production and revenues attributable to the prospects sold in 
table of contents the following table presents pro forma data that reflects revenue and income from continuing operations for as if the hdc  llc and hl  llc sale had occurred at january  pro forma information oil and gas revenue income loss from operations drilling activity during  we drilled international wells in colombia  as follows wells were drilled on concessions in which we hold a working interest  of which were completed and in production at december  and were dry holes 
at december   drilling operations were ongoing on our cpo prospect in colombia 
see cpo development below 
during  no domestic wells were drilled and  at december   no domestic drilling operations were ongoing 
cpo development during  our capital expenditures relating to development of our cpo prospect totaled  and related principally to drilling preparation and seismic processing and commencement of our first test well 
drilling operations on the company s first well on the cpo block in colombia  the tamandua  with a projected target depth of  feet  commenced in july and was subsequently sidetracked to address drilling issues associated with high pressure and inflows of hydrocarbons and fluids into the well bore 
as of december   the sidetrack well had been drilled to  feet and efforts were ongoing to control the well bore while continuing drilling to the target depth 
subsequently  and as of march   the tamandua sidetrack well had a inch liner run to  feet and was drilled to total depth td at  feet 
upon drilling the well to td  the well encountered paleozoics which was a clear indication that the td had been reached 
while the well exhibited oil shows while drilling  and other indications of hydrocarbons such as log analysis that indicate possible productive sands  hole conditions have prohibited sufficient testing on the bottom hole sections 
there have been many attempts to evaluate the well resulting in tool failures and stuck pipe  and current conditions are such that the operator has made the decision not to try to reenter the bottom hole sections 
as a result of these developments  the decision has been made that without the ability to effectively test the lower zones  the most prudent course of action is to plug back the well and to further evaluate the c and c formations 
as indicated by the logging while drilling data  the well encountered approximately feet of net resistive sands in the c formation and approximately feet of net resistive sands in the c formation resistive sands do not necessarily mean pay 
after attempting to complete the well  the rig is expected to be moved to one of two locations that are currently permitted and ready to receive the rig 
in addition  the operator has five additional locations that are in various stages of permitting  location and construction 
we anticipate completion of the tamandua well during the first quarter of with well testing and  as appropriate  completion of the well to follow 
drilling of a second test well on the cpo prospect is expected to commence shortly after completion of the tamandua well 
serrania development during  our capital expenditures relating to development of our serrania prospect totaled  and related principally to drilling preparation and seismic processing 
for  hupecol has advised us that they plan to drill one well on the serrania concession 
drilling on the serrania concession will be subject to conditions in the field and may be extended into the first quarter of houston american energy s estimated net cost associated with drilling the initial well on the serrania concession is approximately thousand 

table of contents leasehold activity during  our macaya and los picachos technical evaluation agreements were converted to exploration and production contracts 
subject to final anh approval of our interest in each contract  we hold a interest in each of the macaya prospect and the los picachos prospect 
asset sales in addition to the above described sale of our indirect interests in the dorotea  cabiona  leona and las garzas blocks in colombia  during  we divested our direct interest in acreage in karnes county  texas 
as a result of the sales  we realized a gain on the sale of oil and gas properties of  during as a result of post closing adjustments relating to our sale of colombian assets  we realized a loss on sale of assets of  during hupecol  the operator of our colombian assets  other than cpo  continues to periodically undertake efforts to divest prospects in an opportunistic manner where it believes that proceeds from such divestitures can be redeployed on a more favorable basis 
during  hupecol engaged an advisor to market the la cuerva and lla prospects in colombia 
hupecol is currently in negotiations with a prospective buyer of those properties  and it is anticipated that a sale will take place during compensation expense in june  our board of directors approved  and we paid  cash bonuses totaling  and granted an aggregate of  shares of restricted stock with a fair value of  to our senior management team to vest over three years and  effective july   we increased the base salary of members of our senior management team by 
in june  our board of directors approved  and we paid  cash bonuses to our senior management team totaling  and  effective june   we increased the base salary of members of our senior management team by 
in august  we expanded our management team with the appointment of a then consultant to serve as senior vice president of exploration 
in june  we modified the non cash compensation arrangements for our non employee directors to provide for annual grants of stock options to purchase  shares of common stock 
pursuant to such revised compensation arrangements  we granted  stock options to non employee directors on june  and granted  stock options to a newly appointed non employee director in july in august  we granted  stock options to the newly appointed member of our management team 
as a result of these option grants and the amortization of the cost associated with options granted in prior years that remain subject to vesting  we recognized non cash compensation expense for totaling  during  we granted stock options to our non employee directors to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock with  options vesting immediately and  options vesting on date of grant and on march  during  we recognized non cash compensation expense associated with grants of restricted stock and stock options totaling  as of december   there was  of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock and  of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options 
the cost of the unvested restricted stock is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years and the cost of the unvested stock options is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 

table of contents critical accounting policies the following describes the critical accounting policies used in reporting our financial condition and results of operations 
in some cases  accounting standards allow more than one alternative accounting method for reporting 
such is the case with accounting for oil and gas activities described below 
in those cases  our reported results of operations would be different should we employ an alternative accounting method 
full cost method of accounting for oil and gas activities 
we follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas property acquisition  exploration and development activities 
under this method  all productive and nonproductive costs incurred in connection with the exploration for and development of oil and gas reserves are capitalized 
capitalized costs include lease acquisition  geological and geophysical work  delay rentals  costs of drilling  completing and equipping successful and unsuccessful oil and gas wells and related internal costs that can be directly identified with acquisition  exploration and development activities  but does not include any cost related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties is not recognized unless significant amounts of oil and gas reserves are involved 
no corporate overhead has been capitalized as of december  the capitalized costs of oil and gas properties  plus estimated future development costs relating to proved reserves  are amortized on a units of production method over the estimated productive life of the reserves 
unevaluated oil and gas properties are excluded from this calculation 
the capitalized oil and gas property costs  less accumulated amortization  are limited to an amount the ceiling limitation equal to the sum of a the present value of estimated future net revenues from the projected production of proved oil and gas reserves  calculated using the average oil and natural gas sales price received by the company as of the first trading day of each month over the preceding twelve months such prices are held constant throughout the life of the properties and a discount factor of  b the cost of unproved and unevaluated properties excluded from the costs being amortized  c the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized  and d related income tax effects 
costs in excess of this ceiling are charged to proved properties impairment expense 
unevaluated oil and gas properties 
unevaluated oil and gas properties consist principally of our cost of acquiring and evaluating undeveloped leases  net of an allowance for impairment and transfers to depletable oil and gas properties 
when leases are developed  expire or are abandoned  the related costs are transferred from unevaluated oil and gas properties to oil and gas properties subject to amortization 
additionally  we review the carrying costs of unevaluated oil and gas properties for the purpose of determining probable future lease expirations and abandonments  and prospective discounted future economic benefit attributable to the leases 
unevaluated oil and gas properties not subject to amortization include the following at december  and at december  at december  acquisition costs evaluation costs total the carrying value of unevaluated oil and gas prospects includes  and  expended for properties in south america at december  and december   respectively 
we are maintaining our interest in these properties and development has or is anticipated to commence within the next twelve months 
stock based compensation 
we use the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the volatility of our common stock price over the expected life of the options  dividend yield  an appropriate risk free interest rate and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amount recognized on the statements of operations 

table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  oil and gas revenues 
total oil and gas revenues decreased  to  in from  in the decrease in revenue was due to the sale of our indirect interests in the dorotea  cabiona  leona and las garzas blocks  partially offset by higher average sales prices for oil during and oil production from new wells brought onto production during the following table sets forth the gross and net producing wells  net oil and gas production volumes and average hydrocarbon sales prices for and gross producing wells net producing wells net oil production bbls net gas production mcf oil average sales price per barrel gas average sales price per mcf as noted elsewhere  we sold our indirect interest in four colombian concessions in december of the wells and production shown in  the concessions sold in december  account for gross wells  net wells and  bbls of net oil production

capital and exploration expenditures and commitments 
our principal capital and exploration expenditures relate to our ongoing efforts to acquire  drill and complete prospects 
during  we invested  for the acquisition and development of oil and gas properties  which included expenses related to drilling of wells in colombia  including  million of drilling costs on the tamandua test well on our cpo prospect  seismic and geological costs in colombia  leasehold costs on us properties  and acquisition and evaluation costs in colombia 
at december   our only material contractual obligation requiring determinable future payments on our part was our lease relating to our executive offices 

table of contents the following table details our contractual obligations as of december payments due by period total year years years years operating leases total in addition to the contractual obligations requiring that we make fixed payments  in conjunction with our efforts to secure oil and gas prospects  financing and services  we have  from time to time  granted overriding royalty interests orri in various properties  and may grant orris in the future  pursuant to which we will be obligated to pay a portion of our interest in revenues from various prospects to third parties 
planned drilling  leasehold and other activities 
as of december   our acquisition and drilling budget for totaled approximately million and related principally to drilling wells in colombia on existing hupecol prospects  drilling well on the serrania block  completion of the first test well on the cpo block and drilling additional wells on the cpo block  and shooting approximately km of d seismic on cpo additional wells may be drilled at locations to be determined based on the results of the planned drilling projects 
our acquisition and drilling budget has historically been subject to substantial fluctuation over the course of a year based upon successes and failures in drilling and completion of prospects and the identification of additional prospects during the course of a year 
due to delays in drilling the tamandua well and the subsequent delays in putting the well online  we anticipate that we will require additional financing to fully fund our drilling budget and our ongoing efforts to acquire additional prospects 
the amount of additional financing we may require  and the timing on which we may require such financing  is dependent upon the ultimate results of the tamandua well and the timing of planned operations which  in each instance  are controlled by the operators of our various properties 
if we are unable to fully fund our drilling budget and fail to satisfy commitments reflected therein  we may be subject to penalties or to the possible loss of some of our rights and interests in prospects with respect to which we fail to satisfy funding commitments 
we have no commitments to provide any additional financing should we require and seek such financing and there is no guarantee that we will be able to secure additional financing on acceptable terms  or at all  to fully fund our drilling budget and to support future acquisitions and development activities 
off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet arrangements or guarantees of third party obligations at december  inflation we believe that inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations since inception 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk the price we receive for our oil and gas production heavily influences our revenue  profitability  access to capital and future rate of growth 
crude oil and natural gas are commodities and  therefore  their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand 
historically  the markets for oil and gas have been volatile  and these markets will likely continue to be volatile in the future 
the prices we receive for production depends on numerous factors beyond our control 
we have not historically entered into any hedges or other derivative commodity instruments or transactions designed to manage  or limit exposure to oil and gas price volatility
