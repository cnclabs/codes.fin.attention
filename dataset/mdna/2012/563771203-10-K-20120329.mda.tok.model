item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
if we incur substantial liability from litigation  complaints  or enforcement actions or incur liabilities or penalties resulting from misconduct by our independent associates  our financial condition could suffer 
routine enforcement actions and complaints are common in our industry 
although we believe we fully cooperate with regulatory agencies and use various means to address misconduct by our independent associates  including maintaining policies and procedures to govern the conduct of our independent associates and conducting training seminars  it is still difficult to detect and correct all instances of misconduct 
violations of our policies and procedures by our independent associates could lead to litigation  formal or informal complaints  enforcement actions  and inquiries by various federal  state  or foreign regulatory authorities against us and or our independent associates in each country 
because we have expanded into foreign countries  our policies and procedures for our independent associates differ depending on the different legal requirements of each country in which an independent associate does business 
any future litigation  complaints  and enforcement actions involving us and or our independent associates could consume considerable amounts of financial and other corporate resources  which could have a negative impact on our business  profitability  and growth prospects 
challenges by private parties to the form of our network marketing system could harm our business 
we may be subject to challenges by private parties  including our independent associates and members  to the form of our network marketing system or elements of our business 
in the united states  the network marketing industry and regulatory authorities have relied on the implementation of distributor rules and policies designed to promote retail sales to protect consumers  prevent inappropriate activities  and distinguish between legitimate network marketing distribution plans and unlawful pyramid schemes 
we have adopted rules and policies based on case law  rulings of the ftc  discussions with regulatory authorities in several states  and domestic and global industry standards 
legal and regulatory requirements concerning network marketing systems  however  involve a high level of subjectivity  are inherently fact based  and are subject to judicial interpretation 
because of this  we can provide no assurance that we would not be harmed by the application or interpretation of statutes or regulations governing network marketing  particularly in any civil challenge by a current or former independent associate or member 
if our network marketing activities do not comply with government regulations  our business could suffer 
many governmental agencies regulate our network marketing activities 
a government agency s determination that our business or our independent associates have significantly violated a law or regulation could adversely affect our business 
the laws and regulations for network marketing intend to prevent fraudulent or deceptive schemes 
our business faces constant regulatory scrutiny due to the interpretive and enforcement discretion given to regulators  periodic misconduct by our independent associates  adoption of new laws or regulations  and changes in the interpretation of new or existing laws or regulations 
for example  in july  the texas attorney general filed suit against us  mannarelief ministries  samuel l 
caster  the fisher institute  and h 
reginald mcdaniel alleging violations of the texas deceptive trade practices act and the texas food  drug and cosmetic act 
we subsequently reached an agreement with the texas attorney general s office settling the enforcement action 
without admitting any wrongdoing  we agreed to refund up to million to certain members and paid million to cover fees and expenses of texas regulators 
we also made certain corporate governance changes required by the texas attorney general s office and have taken a number of actions to address concerns raised by the texas attorney general 
if we are unable to comply fully with the provisions of the settlement  texas regulators could pursue further remedies that may impact our business 
in addition  in the past and because of the industry in which we operate  we have experienced inquiries regarding specific independent associates 
if government regulations regarding network marketing change or are interpreted or enforced in a manner adverse to our business  we may be subject to new enforcement actions and material limitations regarding our overall business model 
network marketing is always subject to extensive governmental regulations  including foreign  federal  and state regulations 
any change in legislation and regulations could affect our business 
furthermore  significant penalties could be imposed on us for failure to comply with various statutes or regulations 
violations may result from misconduct by us or our independent associates  ambiguity in statutes  regulations and related court decisions  the discretion afforded to regulatory authorities and courts interpreting and enforcing laws  and new regulations or interpretations of regulations affecting our business 
if we violate governmental regulations or fail to obtain necessary regulatory approvals  our operations could be adversely affected 
our operation is subject to extensive laws  governmental regulations  administrative determinations  court decisions  and similar constraints at the federal  state  and local levels in our domestic and foreign markets 
these regulations primarily involve the following the formulation  manufacturing  packaging  labeling  distribution  importation  sale  and storage of our products  the health and safety of dietary supplements  cosmetics and foods  trade practice laws and network marketing laws  our product claims and advertising by our independent associates  our network marketing system  pricing restrictions regarding transactions with our foreign subsidiaries or other related parties and similar regulations that affect our level of foreign taxable income  the assessment of customs duties  further taxation of our independent associates  which may obligate us to collect additional taxes and maintain additional records  and export and import restrictions 
any unexpected new regulations or changes in existing regulations could significantly restrict our ability to continue operations  which could adversely affect our business 
for example  changes regarding health and safety and food and drug regulations for our nutritional products could require us to reformulate our products to comply with such regulations 
in some foreign countries  nutritional products are considered foods  while other countries consider them drugs 
future health and safety or food and drug regulations could delay or prevent our introduction of new products or suspend or prohibit the sale of existing products in a given country or marketplace 
in addition  if we expand into other foreign markets  our operations or products could also be affected by the general stability of such foreign governments and the regulatory environment relating to network marketing and our products 
if our products are subject to high customs duties  our sales and competitive position could suffer as compared to locally produced goods 
furthermore  import restrictions in certain countries and jurisdictions could limit our ability to import products from the united states 
increased regulatory scrutiny of nutritional supplements as well as new regulations that are being adopted in some of our markets with respect to nutritional supplements could result in more restrictive regulations and harm our results if our supplements or advertising activities are found to violate existing or new regulations or if we are not able to effect necessary changes to our products in a timely and efficient manner to respond to new regulations 
there has been an increasing movement in the united states and other markets to increase the regulation of dietary supplements  which could impose additional restrictions or requirements on us and increase the cost of doing business 
in several of our markets  new regulations have been adopted  or are likely to be adopted  in the near term that will impose new requirements  make changes in some classifications of supplements under the regulations  or limit the claims we can make 
in addition  there has been increased regulatory scrutiny of nutritional supplements and marketing claims under existing and new regulations 
in europe  for example  we are unable to market supplements that contain ingredients that have not been previously marketed in europe without going through an extensive registration and approval process 
europe is also expected to adopt additional regulations in the near future to set new limits on acceptable levels of nutrients 
the fda has implemented good manufacturing practices for the us nutritional supplement industry 
our operations could be harmed if new regulations require us to reformulate products or effect new registrations  if regulatory authorities make determinations that any of our products do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements  if the cost of complying with regulatory requirements increases materially  or if we are not able to effect necessary changes to our products in a timely and efficient manner to respond to new regulations 
in addition  our operations could be harmed if governmental laws or regulations are enacted that restrict the ability of companies to market or distribute nutritional supplements or impose additional burdens or requirements on nutritional supplement companies 
if our information technology system fails  our operations could suffer 
like many companies  our business is heavily dependent upon our information technology infrastructure to effectively manage and operate many of our key business functions  including order processing  supply chain management  customer service  product distribution  commission processing  cash receipts and payments  and financial reporting 
these systems and operations are vulnerable to damage and interruption from fires  earthquakes  telecommunications failures  and other events 
they are also subject to break ins  sabotage  intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct 
although we maintain an extensive security system and disaster recovery program that was developed under the guidelines published by the national institute of standards of technology  a long term failure or impairment of any of our information technology systems could adversely affect our ability to conduct day to day business 
currency exchange rate fluctuations could reduce our overall profits 
in and  we recognized and  respectively  of net sales in markets outside of the united states 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  certain financial information is required to be translated from foreign currencies to the united states dollar using either the spot rate or the weighted average exchange rate 
if the united states dollar changes relative to applicable local currencies  there is a risk our reported sales  operating expenses  and net income could significantly fluctuate 
we are not able to predict the degree of exchange rate fluctuations  nor can we estimate the effect any future fluctuations may have upon our future operations 
to date  we have not entered into any hedging contracts or participated in any hedging or derivative activities 
we may be held responsible for certain taxes or assessments relating to the activities of our independent associates  which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
our independent associates are subject to taxation and  in some instances  legislation or governmental agencies impose an obligation on us to collect taxes  such as value added taxes  and to maintain appropriate tax records 
in addition  we are subject to the risk in some jurisdictions of being responsible for social security and similar taxes with respect to our distributors 
in the event that local laws and regulations require us to treat our independent distributors as employees  or if our distributors are deemed by local regulatory authorities to be our employees  rather than independent contractors  we may be held responsible for social security and related taxes in those jurisdictions  plus any related assessments and penalties  which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
our equity line with dutchess may not be available to us if we elect to make a draw down 
on september   we entered into an investment agreement the investment agreement with dutchess opportunity fund ii  lp  a delaware limited partnership the investor 
pursuant to the investment agreement  the investor committed to purchase  subject to certain restrictions and conditions  up to  of our common stock  over a period of months from the first trading day following the effectiveness of the registration statement registering the resale of shares purchased by the investor pursuant to the investment agreement the equity line 
dutchess will not be obligated to purchase shares under the equity line unless certain conditions are met  which include effectiveness of the registration statement  the continued listing of our stock on the nasdaq global select market  our compliance with our obligations under the investment agreement and registration rights agreement entered into with dutchess  the absence of injunctions or other governmental actions prohibiting the issuance of common stock to dutchess  the absence of violations of shareholder approval requirements with respect to such issuance of our common stock to dutchess  the accuracy of representations and warranties made to dutchess  and approval of the equity line transaction by our board of directors 
if we are unable to access funds through the equity line  we may be unable to access capital on favorable terms or at all 
any draw downs under our equity line with dutchess may result in dilution to our shareholders 
if we sell shares to dutchess under the equity line  it will have a dilutive effect on the holdings of our current shareholders  and may result in downward pressure on the price of our common stock 
if we draw down amounts under the equity line  we will issue shares to dutchess at a discount of up to from the average price of our common stock 
if we draw down amounts under the equity line when our share price is decreasing  we will need to issue more shares to raise the same amount than if our stock price was higher 
issuances in the face of a declining share price will have an even greater dilutive effect than if our share price were stable or increasing and may further decrease our share price 
our stock price is volatile and may fluctuate significantly 
the price of our common stock is subject to sudden and material increases and decreases 
decreases could adversely affect investments in our common stock 
the price of our common stock and the price at which we could sell securities in the future could significantly fluctuate in response to broad market fluctuations and general economic conditions  fluctuations in our financial results  future securities offerings  changes in the market s perception of our products or our business  including false or negative publicity  governmental regulatory actions  the outcome of any lawsuits  financial and business announcements made by us or our competitors  the general condition of the industry  and the sale of large amounts of stock by insiders 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have significantly affected the quoted prices of the securities of many companies 
the changes sometimes appear to occur without regard to specific operating performance 
the price of our common stock in the open market could fluctuate based on factors that have little or nothing to do with us or that are outside of our control 
our failure to comply with the nasdaq global select market continued listing standards may adversely affect the price and liquidity of our shares of common stock as well as our ability to raise capital in the future 
our common stock is currently listed on the nasdaq global select market 
continued listing of a security on nasdaq is conditioned upon compliance with various continued listing standards 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to satisfy the requirements for maintaining listing on nasdaq 
if we are unsuccessful in maintaining compliance with the continued listing requirements of nasdaq  then our common stock could be delisted 
if our common stock is delisted and we cannot obtain listing on another major market or exchange  our common stock s liquidity would suffer  and we would likely experience reduced investor interest 
such factors may result in a decrease in our common stock s trading price 
delisting may also restrict us from issuing additional securities or securing financing 
on august   we received a letter from nasdaq the notice notifying us that the closing bid price of our common stock was below the minimum bid price requirement for consecutive business days and  as a result  we no longer complied with the minimum bid price requirement under listing rule a for continued listing on nasdaq 
the notice also stated that we had been provided an initial compliance period of calendar days  or until february   to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement 
effective january   we amended our amended and restated articles of incorporation to effect a reverse stock split of our common stock at a ratio of for the primary purposes of the reverse stock split was to increase the per share market price of our common stock in order to maintain its listing on nasdaq  encourage investor interest in mannatech  and promote greater liquidity for our existing shareholders 
on january   we received a letter from the nasdaq stock market confirming that we had regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on nasdaq 
while the reverse stock split allowed us to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement and prevent nasdaq from delisting our common stock  it is possible that  even if an increased per share price can be maintained  we may not be able to continue to satisfy the additional criteria for continued listing of our common stock on nasdaq 
to continue to have our common stock eligible for continued listing on nasdaq  we would also need to satisfy additional criteria under at least one of the three standards set forth by the nasdaq stock market 
under equity standard listing rules a and b  these criteria require  in addition to the minimum bid price  that we have shareholders equity of at least million  our public float must consist of at least  shares with a market value of at least million public float is defined under nasdaq s rules as the shares held by persons other than officers  directors and beneficial owners of greater than of our total outstanding shares  there be at least shareholders  there be at least two market makers for our common stock  and we comply with certain corporate governance requirements 
as of the date of issuance of this report  we were in compliance with these continued listing requirements 
however  we cannot assure you that we will be successful in continuing to meet all requisite continued listing criteria 
certain shareholders  directors  and officers own a significant amount of our stock  which could allow them to influence corporate transactions and other matters 
as of december   our directors  executive officers  and a major shareholder  collectively with their families and affiliates  beneficially owned approximately of our total outstanding common stock 
as a result  if two or more of these shareholders choose to act together based on their current share ownership  they may be able to control a significant percentage of the total outstanding shares of our common stock  which could affect the outcome of a shareholder vote on the election of directors  the adoption of stock option plans  the adoption or amendment of provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws  or the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions 
we have implemented anti takeover provisions that may help discourage a change of control 
certain provisions in our articles of incorporation  bylaws  and the texas business organizations code help discourage unsolicited proposals to acquire our company  even if the proposal may benefit our shareholders 
our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of preferred stock without shareholder approval 
our board of directors has the power to determine the price and terms of any preferred stock 
the ability of our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock without shareholders approval could deter or delay unsolicited changes of control by discouraging open market purchases of our common stock or a non negotiated tender or exchange offer for our common stock 
discouraging open market purchases may be disadvantageous to our shareholders who may otherwise desire to participate in a transaction in which they would receive a premium for their shares 
in addition  other provisions may also discourage a change of control by means of a tender offer  open market purchase  proxy contest or otherwise 
our charter documents provide for three classes of directors on our board of directors with members of each class serving staggered three year terms 
in addition  the texas business organization code restricts  subject to exceptions  business combinations with any affiliated shareholder 
any or all of these provisions could delay  deter or help prevent a takeover of our company and could limit the price investors are willing to pay for our common stock 
we are not required to pay dividends  and our board of directors may decide not to declare dividends in the future 
the declaration of dividends on our common stock is solely within the discretion of our board of directors  subject to limitations under texas law stipulating that dividends may not be paid if payment therefore would cause the corporation to be insolvent or if the amount of the dividend would exceed the surplus of the corporation 
our board of directors may decide not to declare dividends or we could be prevented from declaring a dividend because of legal or contractual restrictions 
the failure to pay dividends could reduce our stock price 
our board of directors suspended dividends in august we may not resume payment of dividends in the future 
concentration risk a significant portion of our revenue is derived from our core ambrotose complex products which include the ambrotose products and advanced ambrotose products 
a decline in sales value of such legacy products could have a material adverse effect on our earnings  cash flows  and financial position 
revenue from the core ambrotose products were as follows for the years ended december   and in thousands  except percentages sales by product of total net sales sales by product of total net sales sales by product of total net sales advanced ambrotose ambrotose total our business is not currently exposed to customer concentration risk given that no independent associate has ever accounted for more than of our consolidated net sales 
circumstances and conditions may change 
accordingly  additional risks and uncertainties not currently known  or that we currently deem not material  may also adversely affect our business operations

unless stated otherwise  all financial information presented below  throughout this report  and in the consolidated financial statements and related notes includes mannatech and all of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis 
company overview since november  we have continued to develop innovative  high quality  proprietary nutritional supplements  topical and skin care products  and weight management products that are sold through a global network marketing system 
we operate in the united states  canada  australia  the united kingdom  japan  new zealand  the republic of korea  taiwan  denmark  germany  south africa  singapore  austria  the netherlands  norway  sweden  mexico  the czech republic  estonia  finland  and the republic of ireland 
our switzerland office was created to manage certain day to day business needs of non north american markets 
we conduct our business as a single operating segment and primarily sell our products through a network of approximately  independent associates and members who had purchased our products and or packs during the last months  who we refer to as current independent associates and members 
new recruits and pack sales are leading indicators for the long term success of our business 
new recruits include new independent associates and members purchasing our packs and products for the first time 
we operate as a seller of nutritional supplements  topical and skin care products  and weight management products through our network marketing distribution channels operating in twenty one countries 
we review and analyze net sales by geographical location and by packs and products on a consolidated basis 
each of our subsidiaries sells similar products and exhibits similar economic characteristics  such as selling prices and gross margins 
because we sell our products through network marketing distribution channels  the opportunities and challenges that affect us most are recruitment of new and retention of independent associates and members  entry into new markets and growth of existing markets  niche market development  new product introduction  and investment in our infrastructure 
current economic conditions and recent developments we introduced several concepts at the end of that we believed would be instrumental in effectively navigating through the challenging economic times 
these concepts included i achieving desired levels of revenue largely through attracting and retaining associates  ii international expansion  iii new product introductions  and iv financial discipline 
the primary challenge of was the overall reduction in recruiting  which continued during and resulted in revenue declines 
in january  we began selling products in mexico 
we opened customer service centers in guadalajara and mexico city 
in late  we opened a training center in monterrey 
in addition to the mexico launch  we began operations in the european countries of czech republic  estonia  finland  and the republic of ireland in june these markets constituted of the consolidated revenue during we continue to believe the international markets will constitute the majority of revenue growth in the future 
as a company devoted to nutritional innovation  we consider our intellectual property to be one of our most valuable corporate assets 
in  we received six patents for technologies related to our ambrotose and ambrotose ao products  five of which were issued by international patent offices 
our ambrotose and ambrotose ao technologies have been granted patents from governing bodies around the world 
we believe these patents further establish our company as an industry leader in nutrition and wellness technologies 
in  we continued to focus on product development in an effort to continually improve and reformulate our existing products 
an example of this was the introduction of our omega supplement that now contains vitamin d the decision to add vitamin d was prompted by the rapidly expanding scientific research documenting the extensive health benefits of vitamin d during  we continued to focus on restoring profitability and generating positive cash flow 
in june  we announced a restructuring of our us operations and elimination of work force positions 
the restructuring reduced the costs of operations by million for the second half of additionally  as opportunities were identified  other operating costs were reduced internationally 
our consolidated balance sheet at the end of the year remained stable in comparison to we continued to operate virtually debt free during although we generated a consolidated net loss  our cash and cash equivalents as well as our liabilities remained essentially unchanged 
a large portion of the consolidated net loss was generated by depreciation expense amounting to million from our enterprise resource planning erp system  which went into operation in and is recorded as computer software costs within property and equipment on our balance sheet 
in  the remaining net book value of the erp system will be fully recognized by the second quarter reducing depreciation expense as compared to the reduction in depreciation expense along with continued financial discipline should improve operating income 
we continue to increase operational efficiency 
we have made certain changes to our management structure to provide stronger foundation for growth and better align our organization with our long term goals 
we believe that efficiencies gained from the organization realignment will help us to improve cost controls and distinguish us in the marketplace by adding emphasis to brand management  associate recruitment  new product development  and international expansion 
even during difficult times  we have maintained our focus to be a generous and socially responsible company 
we continue our charitable donations to mannarelief  a non profit organization that provides charitable services for children in need 
in  mannarelief and mannatech partnered together to launch the give for realsm program 
this donation through consumption initiative was designed to allow consumers and associates to help undernourished children around the world 
for every purchase on an automatic order containing certain products  mannatech provides nutritional supplements through donations to mannarelief for children in need worldwide 
in  our primary goal is to restore sales volume  profitability  and generate positive cash flow 
in order to achieve these financial goals the company plans to i launch a new product during the second quarter which will combine the best technologies from our vast patent portfolio of over patents into a single compelling and affordable product  ii introduce a sales system to our associates that will allow world wide recruitment of both consumers and business builders  and iii continue to build the markets launched in finally  we will continue to aggressively identify and reduce operational expenses and ensure any incremental revenue growth results in additional profitability and cash flow

our sales mix for the years ended december  was as follows in millions  except percentages change dollar percentage consolidated product sales consolidated pack sales consolidated other  including freight total consolidated net sales pack sales correlate to new independent associates who purchase starter packs and to continuing independent associates who purchase upgrade or renewal packs 
however  there is no direct correlation between product sales and the number of new and continuing independent associates and members because independent associates and members utilize products at different volumes 
product sales substantially all of our product sales are made to independent associates at published wholesale prices 
we also sell our products to independent members at discounted published retail prices 
product sales for the year ended december  decreased by million  or  as compared to the same period in the decrease in product sales was primarily due to the reduction in the number of new associates and the loss of existing associates  which resulted in a decline in the number of orders processed during the average order value for the year ended december  was  as compared to for the same period in the increase in average order value resulted in approximately million in additional revenue  which partially offset the overall decline in product sales 
the number of orders placed during the year ended december   decreased by as compared to the same period in pack sales packs may be purchased by our independent associates who wish to build a mannatech business 
these packs are offered to our independent associates at a discount from published retail prices 
there are several pack options available to our independent associates 
in certain markets  pack sales are completed during the final stages of the registration process and can provide new independent associates with valuable training and promotional materials  as well as products for resale to retail customers  demonstration purposes  and personal consumption

a company is to use judgment in reviewing both positive and negative evidence of realizing a deferred tax asset 
furthermore  the weight given to the potential effect of such evidence is commensurate with the extent the evidence can be objectively verified 
as a result  we reviewed the operating results  as well as all of the positive and negative evidence related to realization of such deferred tax assets to evaluate the need for a valuation allowance in each tax jurisdiction

seasonality we believe the impact of seasonality on our consolidated results of operations is minimal 
we have experienced and believe we will continue to experience variations on our quarterly results of operations in response to  among other things the timing of the introduction of new products and incentives  our ability to attract and retain associates and members  the timing of our incentives and contests  the general overall economic outlook  government regulations  the outcome of certain lawsuits  the perception and acceptance of network marketing  and the consumer perception of our products and overall operations 
as a result of these and other factors  our quarterly results may vary significantly in the future 
period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance since we can give no assurances that revenue trends in new markets  as well as in existing markets  will follow our historical patterns 
the market price of our common stock may also be adversely affected by the above factors 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents as of december   our cash and cash equivalents decreased by  or million  to million from million as of december  our principal use of cash is to pay for operating expenses  including commissions and incentives  capital assets  inventory purchases  and international expansion  and to pay quarterly cash dividends 
in august  the quarterly cash dividend was suspended and remained suspended as of december  we fund our business objectives  operations  and expansion of our operations through net cash flows from operations rather than incurring long term debt 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents that can be used  along with normal cash flows from operations  to fund any unanticipated shortfalls in future cash flows 
we remain focused on restoring profitability and generating positive cash flow 
the restructuring and cost reduction initiatives implemented during the second quarter of helped to reduce the costs of operations by million for the second half of as compared to the same period in we believe such results indicate that we are on track to generate positive cash flow in subsequent periods 
we believe operating at lower costs will be a key factor in our ability to generate a positive operating cash flow in and beyond 
working capital working capital represents total current assets less total current liabilities 
at december   our working capital decreased by million  or  to million from million at december  the decrease in working capital primarily related to a decrease in inventories  prepaid expenses  and deferred tax assets 
net cash flows our net consolidated cash flows consisted of the following  for the years ended december in millions provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities our operating  investing  and financing activities are described in more detail below 
operating activities for the years ended december    and  our net operating activities used cash of million  provided cash of million  and used cash of million  respectively

we will continue to aggressively identify opportunities and reduce operational expenses 
we expect that our net operating cash flows in will be sufficient to fund our current operations 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels 
certain events  such as the uncertainty of the worldwide economic environment  could impact our available cash or our ability to generate cash flows from operations 
investing activities for the years ended december    and  our net investing activities used cash of million  provided cash of million  and used cash of million  respectively 
we used cash of million  million  and million in   and  respectively  to purchase capital assets

no dividends were declared to shareholders for and in  we used cash of million to fund payment of cash dividends to our shareholders and million for repayment of capital lease obligations 
the amount of cash used was partially offset by the receipt of million in stock option exercise transactions 
general liquidity and cash flows we believe our existing liquidity and anticipated return to positive cash flows from operations are adequate to fund our normal expected future business operations and possible international expansion costs for the next to months 
however  if our existing capital resources or cash flows become insufficient to meet current business plans  projections  and existing capital requirements  we may be required to raise additional funds  which may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
we entered into an investment agreement with dutchess opportunity fund  ii  lp  a delaware limited partnership on september  the investor committed to purchase  subject to certain restrictions and conditions  up to million of our common stock  over a period of months from the first trading following the effectiveness of the registration statement  which was october  we may draw funds from the equity line by selling shares of common stock to the investor from time to time 
we will not receive any proceeds from the resale of these shares of common stock offered by the investor

our future access to the capital markets may be adversely impacted if we fail to maintain compliance with the nasdaq marketplace rules for the continued listing of our stock 
one such requirement is to maintain a minimum bid price for our stock of per share 
on august   we received a letter from nasdaq notifying us that the closing bid price of our common stock was below the minimum bid price requirement for consecutive business days and  as a result  we no longer complied with the minimum bid price requirement 
effective january   we amended our amended and restated articles of incorporation to effect a reverse stock split of our common stock at a ratio of for the primary purposes of the reverse stock split were to increase the per share market price of our common stock in order to maintain our listing on nasdaq  encourage investor interest in mannatech  and promote greater liquidity for our existing shareholders 
on january   we received a letter from the nasdaq stock market confirming that we had regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on nasdaq 
while the reverse stock split allowed us to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement and prevent nasdaq from delisting our common stock  it is possible that  even if an increased per share price can be maintained  we may not be able to continue to satisfy the additional criteria for continued listing of our common stock on nasdaq 
to continue to have our common stock eligible for continued listing on nasdaq  we would also need to satisfy additional criteria under at least one of three standards 
under equity standard listing rules a and b  these criteria require  in addition to the minimum bid price  that we have shareholders equity of at least million  our public float must consist of at least  shares with a market value of at least million public float is defined under nasdaq s rules as the shares held by persons other than officers  directors and beneficial owners of greater than of our total outstanding shares  there be at least shareholders  there be at least two market makers for our common stock  and we comply with certain corporate governance requirements 
as of the date of issuance of this report  we were in compliance with these continued listing requirements 
however  we cannot assure you that we will be successful in continuing to meet all requisite continued listing criteria 
contractual obligations the following summarizes our future commitments and obligations associated with various agreements and contracts as of december   for the years ending december in thousands thereafter total capital lease obligations purchase obligations operating leases post employment royalty employment agreements total commitments and obligations excludes estimated lease restoration costs in the amount of million  as of december  we have maintained purchase commitments with certain raw material suppliers to purchase minimum quantities and to ensure exclusivity of our raw materials and the proprietary nature of our products 
currently  we have two supply agreements that require minimum purchase commitments 
we also maintain other supply agreements and manufacturing agreements to protect our products  regulate product costs  and help ensure quality control standards 
these agreements do not require us to purchase any set minimums 
we have no present commitments or agreements with respect to acquisitions or purchases of any manufacturing facilities  however  management from time to time explores the possibility of the benefits of purchasing a raw material manufacturing facility to help control costs of our raw materials and help ensure quality control standards 
on may   we entered into a two year agreement with a raw materials supplier 
pursuant to this agreement  we agreed to purchase an aloe vera powder blend  one of our major product components  at specific prices 
the agreement does not contain minimum purchase requirements 
on august   we executed an amendment to a supply agreement with another supplier of raw materials  originally entered into on may  the amendment extends the term of the original supply agreement for a period of three years commencing on june  and expiring on may  pursuant to this amendment  we agreed to pay a total of approximately million to purchase a minimum quantity of an aloe vera powder blend during the term of the agreement as extended by the amendment 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any special purpose entity arrangements  nor do we have any off balance sheet arrangements 
market risks please see quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk under item a of this form k for additional information about our market risks 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the application of gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported values of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period  and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we use estimates throughout our financial statements  which are influenced by management s judgment and uncertainties 
our estimates are based on historical trends  industry standards  and various other assumptions that we believe are applicable and reasonable under the circumstances at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
our audit committee reviews our critical accounting policies and estimates 
we continually evaluate and review our policies related to the portrayal of our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations that require the application of significant judgment by our management 
we also analyze the need for certain estimates  including the need for such items as allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves  long lived fixed assets and capitalization of internal use software development costs  reserve for uncertain income tax positions and tax valuation allowances  revenue recognition  sales returns  and deferred revenues  accounting for stock based compensation  and contingencies and litigation 
historically  actual results have not materially deviated from our estimates 
however  we caution readers that actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions applied in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
if circumstances change relating to the various assumptions or conditions used in our estimates  we could experience an adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
we have identified the following applicable critical accounting policies and estimates as of december  inventory reserves inventory consists of raw materials  finished goods  and promotional materials that are stated at the lower of cost using standard costs that approximate average costs or market 
we record the amounts charged by the vendors as the costs of inventory 
typically  the net realizable value of our inventory is higher than the aggregate cost 
determination of net realizable value can be complex and  therefore  requires a high degree of judgment 
in order for management to make the appropriate determination of net realizable value  the following items are considered inventory turnover statistics  current selling prices  seasonality factors  consumer demand  regulatory changes  competitive pricing  and performance of similar products 
if we determine the carrying value of inventory is in excess of estimated net realizable value  we write down the value of inventory to the estimated net realizable value 
we also review inventory for obsolescence in a similar manner and any inventory identified as obsolete is reserved or written off 
our determination of obsolescence is based on assumptions about the demand for our products  product expiration dates  estimated future sales  and general future plans 
we monitor actual sales compared to original projections  and if actual sales are less favorable than those originally projected by us  we record an additional inventory reserve or write down 
historically  our estimates have been close to our actual reported amounts 
however  if our estimates regarding inventory obsolescence are inaccurate or consumer demand for our products changes in an unforeseen manner  we may be exposed to additional material losses or gains in excess of our established estimated inventory reserves 
at december  and  our inventory reserves were million and million  respectively 
long lived fixed assets and capitalization of software development costs in addition to capitalizing long lived fixed asset costs  we also capitalize costs associated with internally developed software projects collectively fixed assets and amortize such costs over the estimated useful lives of such fixed assets 
fixed assets are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation computed using the straight line method over the assets estimated useful lives 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the remaining lease terms or the estimated useful lives of the improvements 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
if a fixed asset is sold or otherwise retired or disposed of  the cost of the fixed asset and the related accumulated depreciation or amortization is written off and any resulting gain or loss is recorded in other operating costs in our consolidated statement of operations 
we review our fixed assets for impairment whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable  such as plans to dispose of an asset before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
our impairment review includes a comparison of future projected cash flows generated by the asset  or group of assets  with its associated net carrying value 
if the net carrying value of the asset or group of assets exceeds expected cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges  an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value 
the fair value is determined by calculating the discounted expected future cash flows using an estimated risk free rate of interest 
any identified impairment losses are recorded in the period in which the impairment occurs 
the carrying value of the fixed asset is adjusted to the new carrying value and any subsequent increases in fair value of the fixed asset are not recorded 
in addition  if we determine the estimated remaining useful life of the asset should be reduced from our original estimate  the periodic depreciation expense is adjusted prospectively  based on the new remaining useful life of the fixed asset 
the impairment calculation requires us to apply judgment and estimates concerning future cash flows  strategic plans  useful lives  and discount rates 
if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions  we may be exposed to an additional impairment charge  which could be material to our results of operations 
in addition  if accounting standards change  or if fixed assets become obsolete  we may be required to write off any unamortized costs of fixed assets  or if estimated useful lives change  we would be required to accelerate depreciation or amortization periods and recognize additional depreciation expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
historically  our estimates and assumptions related to the carrying value and the estimated useful lives of our fixed assets have not materially deviated from actual results 
as of december   the estimated useful lives and net carrying values of fixed assets are as follows estimated useful life net carrying value at december  office furniture and equipment to years million computer hardware and software to years million automobiles to years million leasehold improvements to years million total net carrying value at december  million we amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the useful estimated life of the leased asset or the lease term 
the net carrying costs of fixed assets and construction in progress are exposed to impairment losses if our assumptions and estimates of their carrying values change  there is a change in estimated future cash flow  or there is a change in the estimated useful life of the fixed asset 
based on management s analysis  no impairment existed during the years ended december    and uncertain income tax positions and tax valuation allowances as of december   we recorded million in current liabilities and million in other long term liabilities related to uncertain income tax positions 
as required by topic  we use judgments and make estimates and assumptions related to evaluating the probability of uncertain income tax positions 
we base our estimates and assumptions on the potential liability related to an assessment of whether the income tax position will more likely than not be sustained in an income tax audit 
we are also subject to periodic audits from multiple domestic and foreign tax authorities related to income tax  sales and use tax  personal property tax  and other forms of taxation 
these audits examine our tax positions  timing of income and deductions  and allocation procedures across multiple jurisdictions 
as part of our evaluation of these tax issues  we establish reserves in our consolidated financial statements based on our estimate of current probable tax exposures 
depending on the nature of the tax issue  we could be subject to audit over several years 
therefore  our estimated reserve balances and liability related to uncertain income tax positions may exist for multiple years before the applicable statute of limitations expires or before the taxing authority resolves an issue 
additionally  we may be requested to extend the statute of limitations for tax years under audit 
the majority of current liability related to uncertain income tax positions is associated with an ongoing internal revenue service irs audit 
it is reasonably possible the tax jurisdiction may request that the statute of limitations be extended  which may cause the classification between current and long term to change 
we believe that our tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions are based upon reasonable judgment and estimates  however  if actual results materially differ  our effective income tax rate and cash flows could be affected in the period of discovery or resolution 
we also review the estimates and assumptions used in evaluating the probability of realizing the future benefits of our deferred tax assets and record a valuation allowance when we believe that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets may not be realized 
if we are unable to realize the expected future benefits of our deferred tax assets  we are required to provide a valuation allowance 
we use our history and experience  overall profitability  future management plans  and current economic information to evaluate the amount of valuation allowance to record 
as of december   we maintained a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets arising from our operations of million because they did not meet the more likely than not criteria as defined by the recognition and measurement provisions of topic in addition  as of december   we had deferred tax assets  after valuation allowance  totaling million  which may not be realized if our assumptions and estimates change  which would affect our effective income tax rate and cash flows in the period of discovery or resolution 
revenue recognition and deferred revenue we derive revenue from sales of individual products  sales of starter and renewal packs  and shipping fees 
substantially all product and pack sales are made to independent associates at published wholesale prices and to members at discounted published retail prices 
we record revenue net of any sales taxes and records a reserve for expected sales returns based on its historical experience 
we recognize revenue from shipped packs and products upon receipt by the customer 
we recognize corporate sponsored event revenue when the event is held 
we defer certain components of our revenue 
at december  and december   deferred revenue was million and million  respectively  and consisted primarily of revenue received from i sales of packs and products shipped but not received by the customers by period end  and ii prepaid registration fees from customers planning to attend a future corporate sponsored event 
we estimate a sales return reserve for expected sales refunds based on historical experience over a rolling six month period 
if actual results differ from our estimated sales return reserve due to various factors  the amount of revenue recorded each period could be materially affected 
historically  sales returns have not materially changed through the years  as the majority of our customers who return their merchandise do so within the first days after the original sale 
sales returns have averaged or less of our gross sales 
for the year ended december  our sales return reserve was composed of the following in thousands sales reserve as of january  provision related to sales made in provision related to sales made prior to actual returns or credits in related to actual returns or credits in related to prior periods sales reserve as of december  accounting for stock based compensation we grant stock options to our employees  board members  and consultants 
at the date of grant  we determine the fair value of a stock option award and recognize compensation expense over the requisite service period  or the vesting period of such stock option award  which is two to four years 
the fair value of the stock option award is calculated using the black scholes option pricing model the calculated fair value 
the black scholes option pricing model requires us to apply judgment and use highly subjective assumptions  including expected stock option life  expected volatility  expected average risk free interest rates  and expected forfeiture rates 
for the year ended december   our assumptions and estimates used for the calculated fair value of stock options granted in  as adjusted for the for reverse stock split that was effective january   were as follows april grant june grant august grant estimated fair value per share of options granted assumptions annualized dividend yield risk free rate of return common stock price volatility expected average life of stock options in years historically  our estimates and underlying assumptions have not materially deviated from our actual reported results and rates 
however  we base assumptions we use on our best estimates  which involves inherent uncertainties based on market conditions that are outside of our control 
if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions we use  the stock based compensation expense reported in our consolidated financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of stock based compensation 
for example  if actual employee forfeitures significantly differ from our estimated forfeitures  we may be required to adjust our consolidated financial statements in future periods 
as of december   using our current assumptions and estimates  we anticipate recognizing million in gross compensation expense through related to unvested stock options outstanding 
if we grant additional stock options in the future  we would be required to recognize additional compensation expense over the vesting period of such stock options in our consolidated statement of operations 
gross compensation expense would equal the calculated fair value of such stock options  which is dependent on the assumptions used to calculate such fair value  but ranges from to of the exercise price multiplied by the number of stock options awarded 
as of december   we had  shares available for grant in the future  as adjusted for the for reverse stock split that was effective january  contingencies and litigation each quarter  we evaluate the need to establish a reserve for any legal claims or assessments 
we base our evaluation on our best estimates of the potential liability in such matters 
the legal reserve includes an estimated amount for any damages and the probability of losing any threatened legal claims or assessments 
the legal reserve is developed in consultation with our general and outside counsel and is based upon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
although we believe that our legal reserves and accruals are based on reasonable judgments and estimates  actual results could differ  which may expose us to material gains or losses in future periods 
if actual results differ  if circumstances change  or if we experience an unanticipated adverse outcome of any legal action  including any claim or assessment  we would be required to recognize the estimated amount that could reduce net income  earnings per share  and cash flows

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not engage in trading market risk sensitive instruments and do not purchase investments as hedges or for purposes other than trading that are likely to expose us to certain types of market risk  including interest rate  commodity price  or equity price risk 
although we have investments  we believe there has been no material change in our exposure to interest rate risk 
we have not issued any debt instruments  entered into any forward or futures contracts  purchased any options  or entered into any swap agreements 
we are exposed  however  to other market risks  including changes in currency exchange rates as measured against the united states dollar 
because the change in value of the united states dollar measured against foreign currency may affect our consolidated financial results  changes in foreign currency exchange rates could positively or negatively affect our results as expressed in united states dollars 
for example  when the united states dollar strengthens against foreign currencies in which our products are sold or weakens against foreign currencies in which we may incur costs  our consolidated net sales or related costs and expenses could be adversely affected 
we believe inflation has not had a material impact on our consolidated operations or profitability 
we expanded into canada in  into australia in  into the united kingdom in  into japan in  into new zealand in  into the republic of korea in  into taiwan and denmark in  into germany in  into south africa and singapore in  into austria  the netherlands  norway  and sweden in september  into mexico in january  and into the czech republic  estonia  finland  and the republic of ireland in june we translate our revenues and expenses in foreign markets using an average rate 
we maintain policies  procedures  and internal processes in an effort to help monitor any significant market risks and we do not use any financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks 
we assess the anticipated foreign currency working capital requirements of our foreign operations and maintain a portion of our cash and cash equivalents denominated in foreign currencies sufficient to satisfy most of these anticipated requirements 
we caution that we cannot predict with any certainty our future exposure to such currency exchange rate fluctuations or the impact  if any  such fluctuations may have on our future business  product pricing  operating expenses  and on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
however  to combat such market risk  we closely monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations 
the foreign currencies in which we currently have exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk include the currencies of canada  australia  the united kingdom  japan  new zealand  the republic of korea  taiwan  denmark  germany  south africa  singapore  austria  the netherlands  norway  sweden  mexico  the czech republic  estonia  finland  and the republic of ireland 
the current spot rate  average currency exchange rates  and the low and high of such currency exchange rates as compared to the united states dollar  for each of these countries as of and for the year ended december  were as follows country foreign currency name low high average spot australia dollar austria  germany  the netherlands  estonia  finland  and the republic of ireland euro canada dollar czech republic koruna denmark krone japan yen mexico peso new zealand dollar norway krone republic of korea won singapore dollar south africa rand sweden krona switzerland franc taiwan dollar united kingdom british pound
