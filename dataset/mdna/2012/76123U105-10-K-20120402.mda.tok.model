item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
special note regarding forward looking statements the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operation should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  this discussion contains forward looking statements that relate to future events or our future financial performance 
these statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results  levels of activity  performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward looking statements 
overview response genetics  inc the company was incorporated in the state of delaware on september  as bio type  inc for the purpose of providing unique molecular profiling services of tumor tissue that has been formalin fixed and embedded in paraffin 
in august  we changed our name to response genetics  inc clinical studies have shown that not all cancer chemotherapy works effectively in every patient  and that a number of patients receive therapy that has no benefit to them and may potentially even be harmful 
our goal is to provide cancer patients and their physicians with a means to make informed  individualized treatment decisions based on genetic analysis of tumor tissues 
we are focusing our efforts in the following areas continued commercialization of our responsedx tests  developing additional diagnostic tests for assessing the risk of cancer recurrence  prediction of chemotherapy response and tumor classification in cancer patients  and expanding our testing services business by pursuing new technologies through collaborations and in licensing to expand our business 
our technologies enable us to reliably and consistently extract the nucleic acids rna and dna from tumor specimens that are stored as formalin fixed and paraffin embedded  specimens and thereby to analyze genetic information contained in these tissues 
this is significant because the majority of patients diagnosed with cancer have a tumor biopsy sample stored in paraffin  while only a small percentage of patients tumor specimens are frozen 
our technologies also enable us to use the ffpe patient biopsies for the development of diagnostic tests 
responsedx the outcome of cancer chemotherapy is highly variable due to genetic differences among patients 
some patients respond well with tumor shrinkage and increase in life span 
other patients do not obtain benefit from the same therapy but may still experience toxic side effects as well as delay in effective treatment and psychological trauma 
at present most chemotherapy regimens are administered without any pre selection of patients on the basis of their particular genetics 
however recent development of very sensitive molecular technologies has enabled researchers to identify and measure genetic and biochemical factors in patients tissues that may predict the probability of success or failure of many currently used anti cancer agents 
in order to increase the chances of a better chemotherapy outcome for cancer patients  we have and continue to expand our development of genetic tests for measuring predictive factors for tumor response in tumor tissue samples 
we have begun offering tests for non small cell lung cancer nsclc responsedx lung  colorectal cancer crc responsedx colon  gastric and gastroesophageal ge cancer responsedx gastric and melanoma cancer responsedx melanoma patients tumor tissue through our laboratory located in los angeles  california  which is certified under the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of clia  and we anticipate offering additional tests for bladder and pancreatic cancer in the future 
these tests are proprietary based tests which serve to help oncologists make optional therapeutic decisions for cancer patients 
the results from our tests may help oncologists choose among chemotherapy regimens to treat their cancer patients 
as of december   our sales team had been expanded to sales people located in the west coast  midwest  and east coast areas of the united states 
diagnostic tests for other cancers in addition to responsedx lung  responsedx colon  responsedx gastric and responsedx melanoma we intend to develop and commercialize tests for other types of cancer that identify genetic profiles of tumors that are more aggressive and recur rapidly after surgery 
we also are identifying genetic profiles of tumors that are more or less responsive to a particular chemotherapy 
following the development of tests to predict the risk of recurrence after surgery  we intend to develop tests to determine the most active chemotherapy regimen for the individual patient at risk 
once developed and after obtaining any necessary regulatory approvals  we intend to leverage our relationships in the healthcare industry to market  sell or license these tests as a means for physicians to determine the courses of cancer treatment 
pursue additional collaborations and in licensing to expand our business we intend to pursue additional collaborations with pharmaceutical companies or in licensing of products or technologies that will enable us to accelerate the implementation of our plans to expand the services we provide to oncologists and pathologists 
we expect to implement this plan on by way of licensing of technology and know how  investments in other companies  strategic collaborations  and other similar transactions 
we expect these collaborations to provide us with early access to new technologies available for commercialization 
there are no assurances that we will be able to continue making our current responsedx tests available  or make additional responsedx tests available  or that will be able to develop and commercialize tests of other types of cancer  or that will be able to expand our testing service business through collaborations 
we anticipate that  over the next months  a substantial portion of our capital resources and efforts will be focused on research and development to expand our series of diagnostic tests for cancer patients  sales and marketing activities related to our responsedx diagnostic tests  and for other general corporate purposes 
research and development expenses represented and of our total operating expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively 
major components of the  and  in research and development expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively  included supplies and reagents for our research activities  personnel costs  occupancy costs  equipment warranties and service  patent fees  insurance  business consulting and sample procurement costs 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could therefore differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition pharmaceutical revenue revenues that are derived from pharmacogenomic testing services provided to pharmaceutical companies are recognized on a contract specific basis pursuant to the terms of the related agreements 
revenue is recognized in accordance with asc  revenue recognition  which requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and title and the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the client or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenues are recorded on an accrual basis as the contractual obligations are completed and as a set of assays is processed through the company s laboratory under a specified contractual protocol and are recorded on the date the tests are resulted 
certain contracts have minimum assay requirements that  if not met  result in payments that are due upon the completion of the designated period 
in these cases  revenues are recognized when the end of the specified contract period is reached  if the minimum assay requirements are not met 
responsedx revenue net revenue for the company s diagnostic services is recognized on an accrual basis at the time discreet diagnostic tests are completed 
each test performed relates to a specimen encounter derived from a patient  and received by the company on a specific date such encounter is commonly referred to as an accession 
the company s services are billed to various payors  including medicare  private health insurance companies  healthcare institutions  and patients 
the company reports net revenue from contracted payors  including certain private health insurance companies  and healthcare institutions based on the contracted rate  or in certain instances  the company s estimate of the amount expected to be collected for the services provided 
for billing to medicare  the company uses the published fee schedules  net of standard discounts commonly referred to as contractual allowances 
the company reports net revenue from non contracted payors  including certain private health insurance companies  based on the amount expected to be collected for the services provided 
the company has its medicare provider number which allows it to invoice and collect from medicare 
invoicing to medicare is primarily based on amounts allowed by medicare for the service provided as defined by common procedural terminology cpt codes 
license fees we have licensed technology for the extraction of rna and dna from ffpe tumor specimens from usc in exchange for royalty fees on revenue generated by use of this technology 
these royalties are calculated as a fixed percentage of revenue that we generate from use of the technology licensed from usc 
total license fees expensed in cost of revenue under the royalty agreement to usc were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we also maintain a non exclusive license to use roche s polymerase chain reaction pcr  homogenous pcr  and reverse transcription pcr processes 
we pay roche a fixed percentage royalty fee for revenue that we generate through use of this technology 
royalties expensed in cost of revenue under this agreement totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we are subject to potentially significant variations in royalties recorded in any period 
while the amount paid is based on a fixed percentage from revenues of specific tests pursuant to terms set forth in the agreements with usc and roche  the amount due is calculated based on the revenue we recognize using the respective licensed technology 
as discussed above  this revenue can vary from period to period as it is dependent on the timing of the specimens submitted by our clients for testing 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we invoice our pharmaceutical clients as specimens are processed and any other contractual obligations are met 
our contracts with pharmaceutical clients typically require payment within days of the date of invoice 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to make required payments 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts  client credit  current economic trends and changes in client payment trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
account balances are charged off against the allowance when it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
to date  our clients have primarily been large pharmaceutical companies 
as a result  bad debts to date have been minimal and there is no allowance for doubtful accounts for our pharmaceutical revenue at december  and we bill medicare and private payors for responsedx upon completion of the required testing services 
as such  we take assignment of benefits and the risk of collection with medicare and private payors 
we continue to monitor the collection history for medicare and private payors 
based on the historical experience for our medicare and private payor accounts  we have determined that related accounts receivable associated with billings over one year old are unlikely to be collected 
therefore  we have recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of  and  as of december  and an allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded for estimated uncollectible amounts due from the company s various payor groups 
the process for estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts involves significant assumptions and judgments 
specifically  the allowance for doubtful accounts is adjusted periodically  and is principally based upon an evaluation of historical collection experience of accounts receivable for the company s various payor classes 
after appropriate collection efforts  accounts receivable are written off and deducted from the allowance for doubtful accounts 
additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts are charged to bad debt expense 
the payment realization cycle for certain governmental and managed care payors can be lengthy  involving denial  appeal  and adjudication processes  and is subject to periodic adjustments that may be significant 
we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
measurement of such losses requires consideration of historical loss experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data  including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates and financial health of specific customers 
we consider all available information in our assessments of the adequacy of the reserves for uncollectible accounts 
income taxes we estimate our tax liability through calculations we perform for the determination of our current tax liability  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded in our balance sheets 
our management then assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered in future periods through future operating results 
to the extent that we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit of such assets will be realized  we establish a valuation allowance to adjust the net carrying value of such assets 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income  based on management s estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions take into consideration future taxable income and ongoing feasible tax strategies in determining recoverability of such assets 
our valuation allowance is subject to significant change based on management s estimates of future profitability and the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets 
the company has established a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of such assets 
results of operations years ended december  and december  revenue 
revenues were  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
the increase was due to increases in responsedx revenue of  and pharmaceutical revenues of  responsedx revenue accounted for of total revenue in the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  responsedx revenues for the year ended december   increased as compared to the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to increased revenues following increased investments in our sales force and adding additional genes to our tests 
we expect that our overall revenues will continue to increase  primarily due to expected increases in responsedx revenues as we add additional sales managers in for the year ended december   our two most significant pharmaceutical customers accounted for approximately of our revenue  as compared to approximately of our revenue for the year ended december  cost of revenue 
cost of revenues for the year ended december  was  as compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
to support the increase in revenue and the anticipated growth the company hopes to achieve  the company hired additional lab personnel and temporary help  incurred additional costs for lab supplies  reagents and shipping costs 
specifically  the increase in cost of revenue resulted primarily from increases in personnel and temporary help costs of  lab supplies and reagent costs of  consulting costs of  and royalties of  offset by a decrease in costs from third party hitachi chemical and shanghai bio processing costs of  and legal expenses of  cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december   an increase of 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the same period in  a decrease of  or 
this decrease resulted primarily from decreases in laboratory supplies  reagents and microarray costs of  personnel related costs of  postage and shipping costs of  and legal services of  we expect research and development expenses to increase as we work to develop additional aspects of our technology and to study diagnostic indicators for various forms of cancer 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses totaled  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
this increase resulted primarily from increases in personnel costs of  business tax of  business consulting costs of  billing service costs of  equipment maintenance of  and bad debt expense of  see responsedx revenue accounts receivable for an explanation of bad debt expense  offset by a decrease in asset impairments of  insurance expense of  and legal services of  sales and marketing expenses 
for the year ended december   our sales and marketing expenses totaled  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
the decrease primarily resulted from decreased sales and marketing activities for responsedx  which included decreases in advertising of  speaker fees of  and travel and meeting costs of  offset by increases in personnel costs of  we expect that sales and marketing costs will increase as we expand our sales and marketing activities in order to gain clinical acceptance of our responsedx assays 
other income 
in  we applied for and received a one time federal grant relating to qualified research and development activities 
the gross amount of the proceeds received was  this amount  net of  of related direct costs  is shown as other income on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
there was no comparable other income for the year ended december  interest income and expense 
interest income was for the year ended december   compared with for the same period in interest expense was  for the year ended december   compare with  for the same period in income taxes 
as of december  and  since we have incurred substantial losses and have generated no taxable income a full valuation allowance has been recorded for the net deferred tax assets since we do not believe the recoverability of the net deferred income tax assets in the near future is more likely than not 
liquidity and capital resources we incurred net losses of  and  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
since our inception in september  we have incurred cumulative losses and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of  we have not yet achieved profitability and anticipate that we will likely incur additional losses for the next year 
we cannot provide assurance as to when we will achieve profitability 
we expect that our cash and cash equivalents will be used to fund our selling and marketing activities primarily related to our responsedx tests  research and development  and general corporate purposes 
as a result  we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability 
management plans to effectively manage cash flows in and expects that cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet the company s working capital requirements through the next months 
nevertheless  until we can generate and maintain sufficient revenues to finance our cash requirements  which we may never do  we expect to finance additional cash needs primarily through public or private equity offerings  strategic collaborations  and other financing opportunities as they may arise 
please see note  subsequent events  regarding the company has raised  on february  we do not know whether additional funding will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are not able to secure additional funding when needed  we may have to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate selling and marketing activities or research and development programs 
in addition  we expect to use our capital to fund research and development and to make capital expenditures to keep pace with the expansion of our research and development programs and to scale up our commercial operations 
the amount and timing of actual expenditures may vary significantly depending upon a number of factors  such as the progress of our product development  regulatory requirements  commercialization efforts  and the amount of cash used by operations 
we expect that we will continue to generate revenue through our pharmacogenomic testing services and through responsedx testing services business provided to pharmaceutical clients and to the users of our responsedx testing services which partially include oncologists  hospitals  and cancer care centers 
these revenues are not guaranteed and are not expected to substantially offset the costs associated with our expansion efforts 
following is a summary of recent events and the expected impact these events have had or may have on our liquidity and future realization of revenues 
sales of common stock under the company s articles of incorporation  the company has one class of common stock and its holders have no preemptive  subscription  redemption or conversion rights 
as described below and in notes and in the notes to consolidated financial statement  the company sold shares of its common stock during and during the first quarter of in connection with certain of these offerings  the company entered into registration rights agreements with the purchasers of the common shares 
may registered offering of common stock on may   the company issued  shares of its common stock at a price of per share in a registered direct public offering to certain institutional investors and received net proceeds of approximately million from the sales  after deducting its estimated offering expenses 
the securities issued with this financing were registered under the securities and exchange act of  as amended 
the shares were issued pursuant to a prospectus supplement dated may  and an accompanying prospectus dated january   pursuant to the company s existing effective shelf registration statement on form s file no 
 which was filed with the securities and exchange commission on december  and declared effective by the sec on january  february private placement on february   we entered into purchase agreements with various investors collectively  the investors for the private placement of an aggregate of  newly issued shares of our common stock the shares at a purchase price of per share the private placement 
the company raised  net of fees  in the private placement 
the investors participating in the private placement were various institutions and all officers and directors of the company 
the final closing of the private placement the closing occurred on february  in connection with the private placement  we also entered into registration rights agreements  each dated february   with the investors pursuant to which we have agreed to file  within days of the closing  a registration statement with the sec to register the shares for resale  which registration statement is required to become effective within days following the closing 
we also granted the investors certain piggyback registration rights  which are triggered if we propose to file a registration statement for our own account or the account of one or more shareholders until the earlier of the sale of all of the shares or the shares becoming eligible for sale under rule b without restriction 
common stock classified outside of stockholders equity deficit on july   we entered into a purchase agreement with certain funds of lansdowne partners limited for the private placement of  newly issued shares of the company s common stock at a per share price of 
the closing of the sale of the shares occurred on july  the aggregate offering price of the shares was approximately million 
in connection with the acquisition of the shares  the purchasers were granted certain preemptive rights permitting them to maintain their percentage ownership interests in connection with future issuances of the company s capital stock  subject to various exceptions and limitations 
we received the funds on july  pursuant to the lansdowne registration rights agreement which is dated july   the company filed a registration statement with the sec to register the  shares sold to lansdowne for resale  which became effective on november  and which registration statement is currently effective 
under the lansdowne registration rights agreement  the company was required to have the registration statement declared effective within days after the private placement closed 
in addition  the company is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts i to cause the registration statement described above to remain continuously effective and ii to maintain the listing of the company s common stock on nasdaq or other exchanges  as defined  for a period that that will terminate on the earlier of july  or the date on which lansdowne has sold all of its shares of common stock 
the company is also required to file with the sec in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of the company under the act 
in the event the company fails to satisfy its obligations under the lansdowne registration rights agreement  the company would be in breach of said agreement  in which event lansdowne would be entitled to pursue all rights and remedies at law or equity including an injunction or other equitable relief 
the lansdowne registration rights agreement does not provide an explicitly stated or defined penalty due upon a breach 
because i the potential penalty for any breach of the lansdowne registration rights agreement is not explicitly stated or defined  which prohibits the company from applying the guidance of asc  registration payment arrangements and ii complying will all filing requirements under the act as described above is not solely within the company s control  the company is required to present lansdowne s investment of  in the company s common stock as common stock outside of stockholders equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet under asc s  classification and measurement of redeemable securities 
on march   we entered into a purchase agreement with certain affiliates of and funds managed by lansdowne partners limited partnership  greenway capital partners and paragon associates for the private placement of  newly issued shares of our common stock at a per share price of 
the closing of the sale of the shares occurred on friday  march  in connection with the acquisition of the shares  the purchasers were granted certain preemptive rights permitting them to maintain their percentage ownership interests in connection with future issuances of our capital stock  subject to various exceptions and limitations 
lansdowne participated in the private placement by electing to exercise the preemptive rights granted to it pursuant to the purchase agreement by and between the company and lansdowne  dated july  net proceeds received from this financing were approximately  in connection with the private placement  we also entered into a registration rights agreement  dated march   with the purchasers the registration rights agreement pursuant to which it has agreed to file  within days of the closing of the private placement  a registration statement with the sec to register the shares for resale  which registration statement is required to become effective within days following the closing 
we also granted certain piggyback registration rights to the purchasers which are triggered if we propose to file a registration statement for its own account or the account of one or more shareholders until the earlier of the sale of all of the shares or the shares become eligible for sale under rule b without restriction 
under the registration rights agreements with the purchasers  the company is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to i cause the registration statements described above to remain continuously effective and ii to maintain the listing of company s common stock on nasdaq or other exchanges  as defined  for a period that will terminate on the earlier of march  or the date on which the purchases have sold all shares of common stock 
the company is also required to file with the sec in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of the company required of the company under the act 
in the event the company fails to satisfy its obligations under the registration rights agreements  the company would be in breach of said agreements  in which event  the purchases would be entitled to pursue all rights and remedies at law or equity including an injunction or other equitable relief 
these registration rights agreements do not provide an explicitly stated or defined penalty due upon a breach 
because i the potential penalty for any breach of these registration rights agreement is not explicitly stated or defined  which prohibits the company from applying the guidance of asc  registration payment arrangements and ii complying with all filing requirements under the act as described above is not solely within the company s control  the company is required to present the investment of  in the company s common stock as common stock outside of stockholders equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet under asc s  classification and measurement of redeemable securities 
comparison of years ended december  and as of december   we had  in cash and cash equivalents  working capital of  and an accumulated deficit of cash flows provided by operating activities during the year ended december   the company used cash flows in operating activities of  compared to  used in the year ended december  the reasons for the decrease in cash used in operating activities of  was due mainly to the increases in accounts payable  and accrued payroll and related liabilities  offset by the decreases in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other current assets  and the decrease in deferred revenue 
the decrease in accounts receivable related mainly to the increased efforts of collections and an increase in allowance for doubtful accounts 
the increase in accounts payable relates to the increase in recruiting costs associated with trying to increase critical headcount 
the decrease in deferred revenue related to the revenue recognition of deferred revenue totaling  cash flows used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this was attributable to the need for property and equipment for our laboratory and new personnel 
cash flows used in financing activities cash flows from financing activities for the years ended december  and provided net cash of  and  respectively  primarily relating to the sale of common stock and a draw on our business line of credit of  off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force 
asu establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of each element within a multiple deliverable arrangement 
specifically  the selling price assigned to each deliverable is to be based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available  third party evidence  if vsoe is unavailable  and estimated selling prices if neither vsoe or third party evidence is available 
in addition  asu eliminates the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration and instead requires allocation using the relative selling price method 
asu will be effective prospectively for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements entered into  or materially modified  in fiscal years beginning on or after june  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on our results of operation or financial position 
in january  the fasb issued asu  improving disclosures about fair value measurements  which amends fasb asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  and requires new disclosures about transfers into and out of level and of the fair value hierarchy and separate disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements relating to level measurements 
asu is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the level measurement disclosures  which are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
early adoption is permitted 
the partial adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position with the adoption of the remaining portion of asu is not expected to have a material effect 
in april  the fasb issued asu no 
 revenue recognition milestone method topic milestone method of revenue recognition 
asu provides guidance on defining a milestone and determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition 
consideration that is contingent on achievement of a milestone in its entirety may be recognized as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if the milestone is judged to meet certain criteria to be considered substantive 
the updated guidance is effective on a prospective basis for milestones achieved in fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning on or after june  entities may elect to adopt the amendments in asu retrospectively for all prior periods 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the company s results of operation or financial position 
in july  the fasb issued asu  health care entities topic presentation and disclosure of patient service revenue  provision for bad debts  and the allowance for doubtful accounts for certain health care entities asu 
in accordance with asu  the company will be required to present its provision for doubtful accounts related to patient service revenue as a deduction from revenue  similar to contractual discounts 
accordingly  the company s revenues will be required to be reported net of both contractual discounts as well as its provision for doubtful accounts related to patient service revenues 
additionally  asu will require the company to make certain additional disclosures designed to help users understand how contractual discounts and bad debts affect recorded revenue in both interim and annual financial statements 
asu is required to be applied retrospectively and is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
early adoption is permitted 
the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operation or financial position
