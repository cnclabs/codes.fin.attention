item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis md a should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in item herein 
management is of the opinion that inflation and changing prices  including foreign exchange fluctuations  will have little  if any  effect on our consolidated financial position or results of our operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our critical accounting policies and estimates involve the use of complicated processes  assumptions  estimates and or judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
an accounting estimate is an approximation made by management of a financial statement element  item or account in the consolidated financial statements 
accounting estimates in our historical consolidated financial statements measure the effects of past business transactions or events  or the present status of an asset or liability 
the accounting estimates described below require us to make assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made 
additionally  different estimates that we could have used or changes in an accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could have a material impact on the presentation of our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
we have discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of the board of directors and have identified the following critical accounting policies for the current fiscal year 
principles of consolidation we consolidate entities when we have the ability to control the operating and financial decisions and policies of that entity and record the portion we do not own as noncontrolling interest 
the determination of our ability to control or exert significant influence over an entity involves the use of judgment 
we apply the equity method of accounting where we can exert significant influence over  but do not control the policies and decisions of an entity 
we use the cost method of accounting where we are unable to exert significant influence over the entity 
capitalized development costs we capitalize certain third party  professional  licensing  and other miscellaneous fees directly related to the procurement  evaluation and establishment of contracts for development projects 
development costs are recorded on the cost basis and are amortized over the estimated economic term of the contract 
we review each project on a quarterly basis to assess whether any changes to our estimates are appropriate 
if accumulated costs of a specific project exceed the net realizable value of such project or the project is abandoned  the costs are charged to earnings 
goodwill  other intangible  and other long lived assets in connection with our acquisitions of the ten washington mini casinos from may  to july   and the acquisition of the south dakota gold slot route operation in south dakota on january   we have goodwill and identifiable intangible assets of million  net of amortization 
goodwill represents a significant portion of our total assets 
we review goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if certain impairment indicators arise under the provisions of authoritative guidance 
we review goodwill at the reporting level unit  which is one level below an operating segment 
we compare the carrying value of the net assets of each reporting unit to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit  based upon a multiple of estimated earnings 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit  an impairment indicator exists and an estimate of the impairment loss is calculated 
the fair value calculation includes multiple assumptions and estimates  including the projected cash flows and discount rates applied 
changes in these assumptions and estimates could result in goodwill impairment that could materially adversely impact our financial position or results of operations 
all of our goodwill is attributable to reporting units within our gaming segment 
we use earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  non cash goodwill and other long lived asset impairment charges  litigation charges  non cash foreign currency transaction gains and losses  and net losses gains from asset dispositions as the measure for future earnings in our impairment test 
management estimates future adjusted ebitda based primarily on its projections of future revenues 
we utilized comparable industry average multiples of adjusted ebitda rates based on industry standards ranging from to times adjusted ebitda when we estimated fair values of our operating facilities as of april  long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets  also comprise a significant portion of our total assets 
we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets when impairment indicators are present or when circumstances indicate that impairment may exist under authoritative guidance 
when management believes impairment indicators may exist  projections of the undiscounted future cash flows associated with the use of and eventual disposition of long lived assets held for use are prepared 
if the projections indicate that the carrying values of the long lived assets are not recoverable  we reduce the carrying values to fair value 
for property held for sale  we compare the carrying values to an estimate of fair value less selling costs to determine potential impairment 
we test for impairment of long lived assets at the lowest level for which cash flows are measurable 
these impairment tests are heavily influenced by assumptions and estimates that are subject to change as additional information becomes available 
allowance for doubtful accounts we establish provisions for losses on accounts and notes receivable if we determine that we will not collect all or part of the outstanding balance 
we regularly review acollectability and establish or adjust our allowance as necessary using the specific identification method 
we make advances to third parties under executed promissory notes for project costs related to the development of gaming and entertainment properties 
due diligence is conducted by our management with the assistance of legal counsel prior to entering into arrangements with third parties to provide financing in connection with their efforts to secure and develop the properties 
repayment terms are largely dependent upon the operating performance of each opportunity for which the funds have been loaned 
interest income is not accrued until it is reasonably assured that the project will be completed and that there will be sufficient profits from the facility to cover the interest to be earned under the respective note 
if projected cash flows are not sufficient to recover amounts due  the note is evaluated to determine the appropriate discount to be recorded on the note for it to be considered a performing note 
if the note is performing  interest is recorded using the effective interest method based on the value of the discounted note balance 
see note of our consolidated financial statements 
we review on a quarterly basis each of our notes receivable to evaluate whether the collection of such note receivable is still probable 
in our analysis  we review the economic feasibility and the current financial  legislative and development status of the project 
if our analysis indicates that the project is no longer economically feasible  the note receivable would be written down to its estimated fair value 
revenue recognition we record revenues from casino operations  management fees  and interest on notes receivable on the accrual basis as earned 
the dates on which payments are collected may vary depending upon the term of the contracts or note receivable agreements 
interest income related to notes receivable is recorded when earned and its collectability is reasonably certain 
the retail value of food and beverage and other services furnished to guests without charge is included in gross revenue and deducted as promotional allowances 
net revenues do not include the retail amount of food  beverage and other items provided gratuitously to customers 
we record the redemption of coupons and points for cash as a reduction of revenue 
these amounts are included in promotional allowances in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the estimated cost of providing such complimentary services that is included in casino expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations was as follows fiscal year ended april  april  food and beverage   other   total cost of complimentary services   accrued jackpot liability we accrue slot jackpot liability as games are played under a matching concept of coin in 
in addition  as of april  and april   we also maintained approximately  and  respectively  in player supported jackpot accrued liability 
player supported jackpot is a progressive game of chance directly related to the play or outcome of an authorized non house banked card game separately funded by our patrons 
any jackpots hit in these card games are paid from such reserved funds 
income taxes income taxes are accounted using an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes 
under this approach  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on anticipated future tax consequences  using currently enacted tax laws  attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
we record current income taxes based on our current taxable income  and we provide for deferred income taxes to reflect estimated future tax payments and receipts 
we account for tax credits under the flow through method  which reduces the provision for income taxes in the year the tax credits first become available 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  based on our estimates  it is more likely than not that a portion of those assets will not be realized in a future period 
the estimates utilized in recognition of deferred tax assets are subject to revision  either up or down  in future periods based on new facts or circumstances 
to fully recognize our net deferred tax assets  we must achieve future taxable income of approximately million 
these earnings will be achieved through our operating properties and increased revenues from future acquisitions 
we believe that such earnings will be sufficient to fully utilize current nols 
we have federal net operating losses of approximately million which expire from to a summary of our deferred tax assets and liabilities is presented in the table below april  april  deferred tax assets net operating loss carryforwards   fixed assets   stock options   impairment of notes receivable and goodwill  other   total deferred tax assets   deferred tax liabilities amortization of intangibles   revenue not recognized for tax reporting and other  total deferred tax liabilities   net deferred tax assets before valuation allowance  valuation allowance   net deferred tax assets   reconciliations between the statutory federal income tax expense rate of in the fiscal years ended april  and april  and our effective income tax rate as a percentage of income before income tax benefit is as follows years ended april  april  percent dollars percent dollars income tax benefit at statutory federal rate  state taxes  permanent differences filed return to financial statement provision permanent true up of book balance to return  federal refund in excess of amount recorded state tax refund resulting from amendments to federal return change in valuation allowance and other  effective income tax rate  accrued litigation liability we assess our exposure to loss contingencies including legal matters 
if the potential loss is justified to be probable and estimative  we will provide for the exposure 
if the actual loss from a contingency differs from management s estimate  operating results could be impacted 
as of april  and april   we did not record any accrued litigation liability 
fair value u 
s 
generally accepted accounting principles defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and establishes a three level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements 
the valuation hierarchy categorizes assets and liabilities measured at fair value into one of three different levels depending on the observability of the inputs employed in the measurement 
the three levels are as follows level observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets at the measurement date for identical  unrestricted assets or liabilities 
level other inputs that are observable directly or indirectly such as quoted prices in markets that are not active  or inputs which are observable  either directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term of the asset or liability 
level unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data and which we make our own assumptions about how market participants would price the assets and liabilities 
the following describes the valuation methodologies used by us to measure fair value real estate held for sale is recorded at carrying value and tested for impairment annually or more frequently  if impairment indicators arise  using projections of undiscounted future cash flows as well as third party valuations see note of our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill  other intangible assets and other long lived assets are recorded at carrying value and tested for impairment annually  or more frequently  using projections of undiscounted future cash flows 
the recorded value of cash  accounts receivable and payable approximate fair value based on their short term nature  the recorded value of long term debt approximates fair value as interest rates approximate market rates 
stock based compensation under accounting standards codification asc topic  compensation stock compensation  the fair value and compensation expense of each option award is estimated as of the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing formula 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our stock over a preceding period commensurate with the expected term of the option 
the expected term of the option is an estimate of the period of time that the option is expected to be outstanding and is based on our historical experience 
the risk free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
expected dividend yield was not considered in the option pricing formula since we historically have not paid dividends and have no current plans to do so in the future 
the compensation cost related to these share based awards is recognized over the requisite service period 
the requisite service period is generally the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
executive overview we were formed in and  since  have primarily been a gaming company involved in financing  developing  owning and operating gaming facilities

non gaap financial measures the term adjusted ebitda is used by us in presentations  quarterly earnings calls  and other instances as appropriate 
adjusted ebitda is defined as net income before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  non cash goodwill and other long lived asset impairment charges  litigation charges  non cash foreign currency transaction gains and losses and net losses gains from asset dispositions 
adjusted ebitda also excludes write offs of project development costs  non cash stock option expenses  and deferred rent escalation 
adjusted ebitda is presented because it is a required component of financial ratios reported by us to our lenders and it is also frequently used by securities analysts  investors  and other interested parties in addition to  and not in lieu of  the us generally accepted accounting procedures gaap results to compare to the performance of other companies who also publicize this information 
adjusted ebitda is not a measurement of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating performance or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with gaap

net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended april  decreased million compared to the same period in the fiscal year ended april  this decrease resulted mainly from the million investment in the nevada gaming license and its related costs 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended april  increased to million cash used compared to million used during the fiscal year ended april  the increase of funds used is primarily due to a net million increase in player supported jackpots in the fiscal year ended april  compared to the release of million in the fiscal year ended april  used for purchase of the washington ii mini casinos 
financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the fiscal year ended april  compared to  net cash provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended april  during fiscal the year ended april   we issued common stock for which we received a net million 
during fiscal year ended april  we repaid a net million of debt and used million for loan issuance costs related to refinancing of our long term debt 
future sources and uses of cash we expect that our future liquidity and capital requirements will be affected by capital requirements related to future acquisitions  cash flow from recent and future acquisitions  new management contracts  working capital requirements  obtaining funds via long term debt instruments  debt service requirements  and disposition of non gaming related assets 
the acres in black hawk  co is currently for sale 
if the acreage is sold we will use the proceeds to reduce debt 
as of april   excluding restricted cash of million  we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
the restricted cash consists of approximately million of player supported jackpots 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will have adequate availability of cash resources to satisfy our liabilities in the normal course of business 
we have made  and are in the process of making  arrangements to ensure that we have sufficient working capital to fund our obligations as they come due 
these potential funding transactions include divesting of non core assets and obtaining long term financing 
we believe that some or all of these sources of funds will be funded in a timely manner and will provide sufficient working capital for us to meet our obligations as they come due  however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in divesting of the non core assets or achieving the desired level of working capital at terms that are favorable to us 
should cash resources not be sufficient to meet our current obligations as they come due  repay or refinance our long term debt and  acquire operations that generate positive cash flow  we would be required to curtail our activities and grow at a pace that cash resources could support which may require a restructuring of our debt or selling core assets 
liquidity the current ratio is an indication of a company s market liquidity and ability to meet creditor s demands 
acceptable current ratios vary from industry to industry and are generally between and for healthy businesses 
if a company s current ratio is in this range  then it generally indicates good short term financial strength 
if current liabilities exceed current assets the current ratio is below  then the company may have problems meeting its short term obligations 
if the current ratio is too high  then the company may not be efficiently using its current assets or its short term financing facilities 
this may also indicate problems in working capital management 
the table below shows as of april   we have a ratio  sufficient to service debt and maintain operations 
current ratio as of april  current ratio current assets  current liabilities  indebtedness as of april   outstanding indebtedness was million  of which million is due by april  on october   we closed on the wells fargo loan  the proceeds of which were used to refinance debt and pay fees associated with the loan 
proceeds from the loan were used to repay debt of million due may   million due july   and million due june  as part of the transaction  we extended million of debt due june  to june  the wells fargo loan matures on october  and bears annual interest of libor  with a floor  plus 
the accrued interest is due monthly along with  principal payments that are due quarterly 
we also have million of debt that is due june  with an annual interest rate 
the accrued interest is due monthly 
the wells fargo loan has a limited number of financial covenants of which we are in compliance with as of april  and the filing date of this document 
we are also not permitted to incur additional indebtedness without this lender s prior approval 
following the sale of the colorado grande casino on may  see note of our consolidated financial statements  we repaid million of the million debt from the cash proceeds we received from this sale 
in addition  we are required to use all payments we receive pursuant to the gi note to further pay down the million debt 
as a result of the south dakota gold acquisition  we issued three promissory notes 
the first promissory note  in the principal amount of  is due on january  and bears an interest rate of per annum 
it is to be repaid in fifty nine monthly principal installments of  plus all accrued and unpaid interest  starting on february  the second promissory note  in the principal amount of  with a stated interest rate and an imputed interest rate of  matures on january   and is payable in sixty equal monthly installments of  on the twenty seventh day of each month  the first installment being payable on february  the third promissory note  in the principal amount of  with a stated interest rate and an imputed interest rate of  matures on january  as of april   our total indebtedness is million

new accounting pronouncements pending intangibles goodwill and other in september of  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment 
under the amendments in this guidance  an entity may consider qualitative factors before applying step of the goodwill impairment assessment  but may no longer be permitted to carry forward estimates of a reporting unit s fair value from a prior year when specific criteria are met 
these amendments are effective for goodwill impairment tests performed in fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted 
we do not believe the new guidance will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements
