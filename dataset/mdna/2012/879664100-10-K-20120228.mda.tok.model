item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition introduction and overview of business tellabs designs  develops and supports telecommunications networking products 
we generate revenue principally through the sale of these products to communications service providers worldwide as both stand alone network elements and as elements of solutions integrated under a common network management system 
we also generate revenue by providing services to our customers 
we operate in three business segments broadband  transport and services 
the broadband segment includes data  access and managed access product portfolios that facilitate mobile communications  wireline business services and bundled consumer services 
revenue from data products is driven by the need for wireless and wireline carriers to deliver next generation voice  video and internet services 
revenue from access products is primarily driven by the need for wireline carriers to deliver bundled voice  video and internet services to residential customers 

table of contents revenue from managed access products is driven by the need for wireless and wireline carriers to deliver mobile voice and internet services and business oriented voice  video and internet services 
the transport segment primarily includes optical transport systems and digital cross connect systems 
revenue for these products is driven by the needs of wireline and wireless carriers to deliver mobile services  business oriented services and residential services 
the services segment includes deployment  support  training and professional services 
revenue from deployment  support and training services arises primarily from the sales of products and continues to represent the majority of services revenue  while the balance comes from professional services offerings 
tellabs operates in a dynamic industry 
customer consolidation has resulted in increased pricing pressure 
in addition  customer spending is pressured and competition is heightened on a global basis 
some equipment suppliers have also consolidated 
heightened competition by these suppliers has resulted in increased pricing pressure for tellabs and some of its direct competitors 
within this backdrop  we continue to transform the company with new products and services 
the company s strategy is to focus on a product portfolio that addresses the global markets for mobile backhaul and packet optical solutions 
we expect that executing this strategy of directing resources to create innovative products and services will help customers succeed 
management continues to define and implement initiatives to improve overall performance 
on july   management initiated a restructuring plan that will enable us to align our cost structure to current business conditions 
this restructuring plan primarily implements workforce reductions of about employees 
on january   management initiated a restructuring plan that aligns expenses with revenue 
tellabs is stopping new development on the tellabs smartcore product and consolidating research and development into fewer locations 
this restructuring plan will reduce our workforce by approximately employees 
for a further discussion related to this restructuring plan  see note  subsequent events  to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
results of operations net loss for the year was million  compared with net earnings of million in and million in in  revenue was  million  compared with  million in and  million in revenue decreased across all three segments in in  revenue increased in all three segments 
in  gross margin was  compared with in and in the decrease in gross margin in from was primarily as a result of lower revenue from digital cross connect systems and data products in north america 
the increase in gross margin in from was driven primarily by the higher level of revenue from digital cross connect systems and data products in north america 
gross margin in also included a million charge for excess purchase commitments 
the million pretax charge related to excess purchase commitments for a large tender in india that was subsequently cancelled by the customer 
operating expenses in were million  compared with million in and million in for the full year  lower sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses and intangible asset amortization  were more than offset by increased research and development expenses  restructuring and other charges  and the million goodwill and ipr d impairments incurred in the third quarter of operating expenses increased during the year  compared with  due primarily to higher research and development expenses for data products and optical transport systems as well as higher sales and marketing costs associated with expansion into markets outside north america

comparing with  revenue from data products increased and revenue from access and managed access products decreased in from data product revenue was million in  compared with million in and million in in  increased revenue from managed edge systems was offset by lower revenue from our multi service router series 
in  increased revenue from both our multi service router series and our managed edge systems was driven primarily by a major north american customer 
access revenue was million in  compared with million in and million in in  access revenue declined primarily due to lower revenue from single family onts 
in  access revenue declined as several key customers continued to transition to alternate network architectures 
managed access revenue was million in  compared with million in and million in in  increased revenue from managed access systems  driven primarily by one customer outside north america  was offset by lower revenue from sdh transport systems 
in  revenue from both managed access systems and sdh transport systems declined as customers around the world continued to migrate to ip and ethernet data products 
the primary products in the transport segment are optical transport systems and digital cross connect systems 
revenue from the transport segment was million in  compared with million in and million in in  increased revenue from optical transport systems was offset by lower revenue from digital cross connect systems 
in  revenue from both digital cross connect systems  driven primarily by a major north american carrier  and optical transport systems grew 
revenue from the services segment was million in  compared with million in and million in in  the decline in services segment revenue was driven primarily by lower deployment revenue  which was partially offset by higher professional and support services revenue

the improvement in product gross margin in from is the result of increased revenue from digital cross connect systems and data products 
product gross margin in also included the million charge for excess purchase commitments 
services gross margin the increase in services gross margin in from was driven primarily by a mix shift from lower margin deployment services to higher margin professional services and improved profitability for professional services 
the decline in services gross margin in from was driven by a higher level of lower margin deployment services revenue 
gross margin trend gross margin is different for each product and services category and for each product within a category because the actual margin depends on the specific system configuration sold as well as customer and geographic pricing differences 
this variability  which tends to affect gross margin on a quarterly basis  is likely to continue

the increase in operating expenses in from was driven by increased research and development spending and increased sales and marketing expenses outside north america 

table of contents intangible asset amortization the decline in intangible asset amortization in from was due to certain intangibles reaching full amortization 
the increase in intangible asset amortization in from was due to the amortization of developed technology acquired in our acquisition of wichorus 
restructuring and other charges in the three year period  restructuring and other charges consisted primarily of severance and facility and asset related charges 
goodwill impairment in the third quarter of  we performed an interim goodwill impairment review on our broadband segment because we continued to experience a significant decline in business volumes from a major customer that had an adverse impact on the results of the broadband segment  and our overall market capitalization continued to fall below book value 
we determined that the fair value of the identifiable net assets  excluding goodwill  was greater than the fair value of the segment  resulting in no value attributable to goodwill 
consequently  the financial results for the third quarter of included an impairment charge for the full amount of broadband segment goodwill  amounting to million 
the services segment did not incur an impairment of its goodwill since its fair value was determined to be greater than its carrying value 
ipr d impairment in conjunction with the interim goodwill impairment review  we assessed the valuation of our indefinite lived intangible assets  which consisted of ipr d in the third quarter of updated management projections related to the ipr d from the wichorus acquisition in resulted in an impairment charge in the third quarter of of million 
segment profit in millions broadband transport services total segment profit we define segment profit as gross profit less research and development expenses 
segment profit excludes sales and marketing expenses  general and administrative expenses  the amortization of intangibles  restructuring and other charges  the impact of equity based compensation and the goodwill and ipr d impairment charges 
segment profit the decline in broadband segment profit in from was driven primarily by lower revenue from our multiservice router series and higher research and development expenses 
the increase in broadband segment profit in from was driven primarily by the higher level of revenue from data products 
broadband segment profit in also included the million charge for excess purchase commitments 
the decline in transport segment profit in from was driven primarily by lower revenue from digital cross connect systems  which carry gross margins higher than the corporate average 
the increase in transport segment profit in from was driven primarily by the higher level of revenue from digital cross connect systems  partially offset by higher revenue from optical transport systems  which carry gross margins below corporate average 
the decline in services segment profit in from was driven primarily by lower revenue from deployment services  partially offset by improved profitability from professional services 
the slight decline in services segment profit in from was driven primarily by higher costs

income tax expense increased in due to higher earnings  partially offset by tax benefits of million from the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and million from the reversal of accrued taxes due to the expiration of a statute of limitations 
as a result of higher domestic losses in and the net cumulative loss generated in the current and prior two years  sufficient negative evidence exists for us to determine that a full valuation allowance be established against our domestic deferred tax assets

financial condition  liquidity capital resources our principal source of liquidity remained cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million as of december   which decreased by million since year end of the total cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  as of december   million was held in subsidiaries outside the united states 
the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities for is the result of cash used for operating activities  cash used to repurchase common stock  distributions of cash dividends and capital expenditures 
in  we used million of cash for operating activities  compared with cash generated from operating activities of million in and million in during  we distributed million to our stockholders through our quarterly cash dividends and repurchased million shares of common stock at a cost of million under the b plan 
we provide no assurances as to future repurchases of common stock or declarations or payments of cash dividends 
our investments are highly liquid instruments 
we may rebalance the portfolio from time to time  which may affect its duration  credit structure and future income 

table of contents based on historical performance and current forecasts  we believe the company s cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will satisfy working capital needs  capital expenditures and other liquidity requirements related to existing operations for the next months 
future available sources of working capital  including cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities  cash generated from future operations  short term or long term financing  equity offerings or any combination of these sources  should allow us to meet our long term liquidity needs 
current policy is to use cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities to fund business operations  to expand business  potentially through acquisitions  to repurchase common stock and to pay a cash dividend 
non gaap financial measures and comparisons in addition to reporting financial results in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  tellabs  inc has provided non gaap financial measures as additional information for its operating results 
we believe that comparing some non gaap financial measures provides important supplemental information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial results 
commonly compared non gaap financial data includes gross profit as a percentage of revenue  operating expenses  operating earnings  net earnings and net earnings per share 
a complete reconciliation between non gaap financial measures and the gaap financial measures  along with an explanation of why we believe non gaap measures to be of value to management and investors  is contained in the reconciliation of non gaap adjustments provided following this discussion 
non gaap gross profit margin in was  compared with in the decrease in gross profit margin was driven primarily by the lower level of data and transport product revenue  partially offset by higher services margins

these measures have not been prepared in accordance with gaap and may be different from measures used by other companies 
whenever we use non gaap financial measures  we designate these measures  which exclude the effect of certain charges  as adjusted and provide a reconciliation of non gaap financial measures to the most closely applicable gaap financial measure 
the non gaap financial measures eliminate certain items of expenses and losses from cost of revenue  operating expenses  other income and expenses  and income taxes 
management believes that this presentation allows investors to better evaluate the current operational and financial performance of our business and facilitate comparisons to historical results of operations 
management uses these measures for reviewing our financial results and for business planning and performance management 
management discloses this information publicly along with a reconciliation of the comparable gaap amounts  to provide access to the detail and general nature of adjustments made to gaap financial results 
while some of these excluded items have been periodically reported in our statements of operations  including significant restructuring and other charges  their occurrence in future periods depends on future business and economic factors  among other evaluation criteria  and the occurrence of such events and factors may frequently be beyond the control of management 

table of contents footnotes to reconciliation of non gaap adjustments a the adjustments to cost of revenue  research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses reflect equity based compensation expense 
we exclude these measures when reviewing financial results and for business planning and performance management 
we believe that the exclusion of equity based compensation expense allows for more accurate comparisons of operating results to our peer companies 
in addition  we believe this non cash gaap measure is not indicative of our fundamental operating performance 
b we exclude amortization of intangible assets resulting from acquisitions to evaluate our continuing operational performance 
the amortization of purchased intangible assets associated with acquisitions results in recording expense in our gaap financial statements that were already expensed by the acquired company before the acquisition and for which we have not expended cash 
we believe this non cash gaap measure is not indicative of our fundamental operating performance 
accordingly  we analyze the performance of operations without regard to such expenses 
c we exclude restructuring and other charges because we believe that they occur outside of the ordinary course of and are not related directly to the underlying performance of our fundamental business operations 
we exclude these measures when reviewing financial results and for business planning and performance management 
although these events are reflected in our gaap financials  these transactions may limit the comparability of our fundamental operations with prior and future periods 
d we recorded a million goodwill impairment charge in  which related to the broadband segment 
in addition  we recorded a million other than temporary impairment for in process research and development intangible assets in we believe these non cash gaap measures are not indicative of our core operating performance 
e other expense income  net includes charges to write down long term investments of million in and million in we exclude write downs and gains on sales of long term investments because we believe that they are not related directly to the underlying performance of our working capital assets 
f we calculate a separate tax expense and effective tax rate for gaap and for non gaap purposes 
for non gaap purposes  we use a effective tax rate which represents the projected  long term effective tax rate on non gaap pretax income 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth an overview of contractual obligations  as of december   that will affect our liquidity and cash flows in future periods payments due by period in millions total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations operating lease obligations related to restructuring activities  net purchase commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers loan related to other marketable securities borrowing fees on loan related to other marketable securities total contractual obligations our agreement with the lender of the stock has no defined date when we must repay the loan  however  the loan is callable at the discretion of the lender 
our investment in cisco stock is maintained at a value equal to the market value of the loaned securities 
see note  investments  to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for a more complete description of this obligation 
for purposes of contractual obligations disclosure  we used cisco s average share price of for the quarter ended december   to determine the hypothetical value of the borrowing fees assuming the loans are settled in we use several contract manufacturers and suppliers who provide manufacturing services for our products 
during the normal course of business  we enter into agreements with certain contract manufacturers and 
table of contents suppliers that enable them to procure inventory based on criteria defined by us to reduce manufacturing lead times and ensure adequate component supply 
under these agreements  the maximum liability for purchase commitments as of december   was million  of which million for excess purchase commitments was recorded in other accrued liabilities on the balance sheet 
the borrowing fees on the loan related to other marketable securities that are recorded in the financial statements each period are affected by cisco s average share price at the end of each quarter 
as of december   we had unrecognized tax positions of million in long term income tax liabilities 
at this time  we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes 
off balance sheet arrangements none 
critical accounting estimates the methods  estimates and judgments that we use in applying accounting policies can have a significant impact on the results we report in the consolidated financial statements 
some of these estimates require difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to estimate matters that are inherently uncertain 
for the reasons discussed below  we consider critical accounting estimates to be revenue recognition  the allowance for excess and obsolete inventory and excess purchase commitments collectively e o  goodwill  the valuation of amortizable intangible assets  the estimate of the warranty liability  reserve requirements for lease obligations on vacated facilities  income taxes  valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and equity based compensation 
we have discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit and ethics committee of tellabs board of directors 
revenue recognition determining the proper revenue recognition in our financial statements requires us to make judgments about the application of the accounting rules based on the facts and circumstances of each customer arrangement 
when a customer arrangement involves multiple deliverables  we evaluate all deliverables to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting 
this approach involves a determination about whether the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone basis  and whether delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and is substantially in our control where an arrangement contains a general right of return relative to the delivered item 
we account for the delivered item as a separate unit of accounting if we satisfy both points identified above 
arrangement consideration is allocated to all deliverables based on the relative selling price 
we determine selling price using one of three methods vendor specific objective evidence  third party evidence or estimated selling price 
we use vendor specific objective evidence if available  third party evidence if vendor specific objective evidence is not available or estimated selling price if neither vendor specific objective evidence nor third party evidence is available 
the factors mentioned above involve estimates and judgments that can impact the pattern and timing of revenue recognition 
the determination of whether software products bundled with tangible products where the software components and non software components function together to deliver the product s essential functionality can impact whether revenue is recognized under software revenue recognition guidance or under general revenue recognition guidance 
this assessment could impact the amount and timing of revenue recognition 

table of contents many of our contracts contain customer acceptance provisions 
in cases involving sales of new products  for example  we defer revenue until we receive formal customer acceptance 
in cases where we can demonstrate that the product or service has met all acceptance criteria prior to formal customer acceptance  or where we have sufficient historical evidence of customer acceptance  we consider acceptance to be perfunctory  and therefore formal customer acceptance is not required 
judgment about whether acceptance is perfunctory can impact the timing of revenue for contracts containing acceptance provisions 
excess obsolete inventory and excess purchase commitments we determine inventory cost using the first in  first out method  and we value inventory at the lower of cost or market  with market determined by reference to current replacement cost or net realizable selling price 
we determine the amount of inventory that is excess and obsolete e o and purchase commitments in excess of requirements using estimates of future demand for individual components of raw materials and finished goods 
to determine e o  we compare listings of existing piece parts and finished goods to future product demand and usage requirements 
we record a full valuation allowance for inventory quantities on hand in excess of two years expected usage 
for inventory quantities that fall between one and two years demand  we use management s judgment to determine the appropriate e o amount 
we do not record an allowance if the quantity is less than one year s forecasted demand 
we believe the accounting estimate related to e o is a critical accounting estimate because it requires us to make assumptions about future sales volumes and product mix  both of which can be highly uncertain 
changes in these estimates can have a material effect on our financial statements 
goodwill goodwill impairment is reviewed annually and when impairment indicators exist by comparing the segment s net book value to its fair value 
if the segment s fair value is greater than its net book value  then further impairment tests are not deemed necessary 
if the segment s fair value is less than its net book value  then further tests are performed to determine the segment s implied fair value of goodwill 
the implied fair value is then compared against the book value of goodwill to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective because it requires the use of estimates and assumptions in determining a segment s fair value 
we calculate the fair value of each segment by using a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and the market approach of valuation 
the discounted cash flow method requires us to use estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of the operating segments 
although we base cash flow forecasts on assumptions that are consistent with plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying operating segments  there is significant judgment in determining the cash flows attributable to these operating segments  including markets and market share  sales volumes and mix  research and development expenses  tax rates  capital spending  discount rate and working capital changes 
cash flow forecasts are based on segment operating plans for the early years and business projections in later years 
the market approach is based on a comparison of the company to comparable publicly traded firms in similar lines of business 
this method requires us to use estimates and judgments when determining comparable companies 
we assess such factors as size  growth  profitability  risk and return on investment 
we believe the accounting estimate related to the valuation of goodwill is a critical accounting estimate because it requires us to make assumptions that are highly uncertain about the future cash flows of our segments 
changes in these estimates can have a material impact on our financial statements 
intangible assets intangible assets consist primarily of purchased technology  which arose primarily from acquisitions of businesses in and we evaluate the carrying value of intangible assets and other long lived assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist 
we test finite lived intangible assets for recoverability using pretax undiscounted 
table of contents cash flows 
although we base cash flow forecasts on assumptions that are consistent with plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying operating segments  there is significant judgment in determining the cash flows attributable to these operating segments  including markets and market share  sales volumes and mix  research and development expenses  capital spending and working capital changes 
cash flow forecasts are based on segment operating plans for the early years and business projections in later years 
we compare the pretax undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the asset group 
if the carrying value exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows of the asset group  an impairment charge must be recognized in the financial statements 
we believe the accounting estimate related to the valuation of intangible assets is a critical accounting estimate because it requires us to make assumptions about future sales prices and volumes for products that involve new technologies and applications where customer acceptance of new products or timely introduction of new technologies into their networks are uncertain 
the recognition of an impairment could be material to our financial statements 
warranty costs we provide warranties for all of our products  with terms and conditions that vary depending on the product sold 
we provide a basic limited warranty for periods that range from days to six years 
we record warranty expense in cost of revenue on the consolidated statement of operations 
we estimate warranty liability by applying historical warranty return rates and costs per claim to the number of units shipped that are still within their warranty period 
in addition  when we judge that a particular warranty claim will involve costs that are out of the ordinary  we separately estimate the costs for that claim and record the amount as an additional warranty expense for the period in which we determine we have a liability 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to warranty costs is a critical accounting estimate because it requires us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain  including future rates of product failure  repair costs  including availability of materials  shipping and handling  and de installation and re installation costs at customers sites  among others 
consequently  the changes in warranty reserves could be material to our financial statements 
restructuring reserves leases restructuring reserves consist of amounts we owe on leases for facilities we vacated  reduced by an estimate of sublease rental income 
we determined the amount of the reserve for each facility by estimating the amount of time it will be vacant before it is sublet and the terms of the sublease agreement compared with our obligation  then reducing the reserve by an estimate of potential sublease income 
we examine real estate market conditions in each location where we have a vacated facility 
we believe the accounting estimate of restructuring lease obligations is a critical accounting estimate because it requires us to make assumptions about real estate rental markets and conditions that are highly uncertain  and changes in our estimates could have a material impact on our financial statements 
income taxes we conduct business and file income tax returns in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world 
this requires us to interpret tax laws that are often vague and uncertain  and to make judgments about the application of those laws when we prepare tax returns 
when we calculate income tax expense and the related tax liabilities and assets for the consolidated financial statements  we use estimates of the amount of income  deductions and credits that we believe are allowable under local tax laws and that should be allowed by tax authorities if the tax returns are audited 
however  tax authorities may disagree on the amounts of income  deductions and credits that are allowed to be included in those tax returns 
this could result in paying additional taxes or receiving a refund of previously paid taxes 
because we are a large multi national corporation  the united states internal revenue service irs generally audits each of our federal income tax returns 
currently the irs is auditing the pre acquisition tax period of wichorus 
we are not under audit in any of our other major jurisdictions for tax periods through although 
table of contents we have recorded tax reserves for potential adjustments to tax liabilities for prior years  we cannot provide assurance that a material adjustment to our financial statements  either positive or negative  will not result when the audits are concluded 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets deferred tax assets arise when we recognize charges or expenses in our financial statements that will not be allowed as income tax deductions until future periods 
the term deferred tax asset also includes unused tax net operating losses and tax credits that we are allowed to carry forward to future years 
accounting rules permit us to carry deferred tax assets on the balance sheet at full value as long as it is more likely than not the deductions  losses  or credits will be used in the future 
a valuation allowance must be recorded against a deferred tax asset if this test cannot be met 
the accounting rules state that a company with a recent history of losses would have a difficult  perhaps impossible  time supporting a position that utilization of its deferred tax assets was more likely than not to occur 
we believe that the cumulative loss incurred by the company in the through period represents sufficient negative evidence to determine that the establishment of a valuation allowance against domestic deferred tax assets is appropriate 
until an appropriate level of profitability is attained  we expect to maintain a valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets related to future us and certain non us tax benefits 
equity based compensation we account for equity based compensation in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb authoritative guidance related to accounting for share based payments 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this guidance  we measure equity based compensation cost  at the grant date  based on the value of the award  which is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of equity based awards at the grant date requires several assumptions  and a change in these assumptions could materially impact equity based compensation expense and results of operations 
these assumptions include our stock s expected volatility  the risk free interest rate  expected option term and expected dividend yield 
in addition  we estimate the amount of equity based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
strategy and outlook tellabs operates in a challenging  exciting industry 
over the past few years  wireless carriers  under competitive pressure  have aggressively invested in network infrastructure to deliver third generation g data oriented services 
as consumers embrace smartphones  tablets and new bandwidth hungry mobile internet applications such as video  wireless carriers need to expand the capacity of these networks to keep up with increasing mobile internet traffic 
today  carriers have begun to deploy fourth generation g network equipment 
in the wireline sector  telecom service providers face significant competitive threats to their most profitable residential services from cable tv providers and the substitution of mobile services 
in an effort to counter line loss and declining voice revenues in recent years  carriers have undertaken ambitious and expensive programs to transform their wireline access networks with fiber optic technology to deliver a bundle of voice  data and video services that is competitive with or superior to that offered by competitors 
after several years of aggressive spending  carriers have moderated investment in their wireline access networks 
on the business side  wireline carriers and cable tv service providers have also introduced next generation data technology to deliver new business oriented voice  video and data internet services to their corporate customers 
many carriers have consolidated to achieve the advantages of scale needed to sustain such major network build outs 
as a result  these large carriers have gained increased pricing power over equipment suppliers such as tellabs 
this consolidation has had an adverse effect on overall capital spending by carriers 
some equipment suppliers have also consolidated to achieve the scale advantages needed to better address their consolidated customer base 
heightened competition by these suppliers has resulted in increased pricing pressure for tellabs and some of its direct competitors on a global basis 

table of contents expectations for capital spending levels by our customers in vary 
we expect overall global capital spending to decline slightly this year as carriers continue to shift investment from delivering residential wireline services to expanding mobile network capacity 
we cannot predict how macroeconomic issues will continue to affect capital spending by our customers in while the economic environment may be challenging  we believe we are invested in the right solutions for growing markets 
the company s strategy is to focus on a product portfolio that addresses the global markets for packet optical and mobile backhaul solutions 
we expect that executing this strategy of directing resources to create innovative products and services will help customers succeed 
since  we have actively returned capital to stockholders through stock buybacks 
in  we began paying quarterly cash dividends to stockholders 
we have resources in place to fund both organic and inorganic growth and return capital to stockholders 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk during the normal course of business  we invest a portion of our cash and cash equivalents in marketable securities 
these investments are sensitive to interest rate movements and their fair value will decline as interest rates rise and increase as interest rates decline 
for a discussion of our investments in marketable securities for the fiscal years ended december   and december   see note  investments  to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k and is incorporated herein by reference 
foreign currency exchange risk we conduct business on a global basis in us and foreign currencies subjecting us to risks associated with fluctuating foreign exchange rates 
to mitigate these risks  we use derivative foreign exchange contracts to address nonfunctional exposures that are expected to be settled in one year or less 
the derivative foreign exchange contracts consist of foreign currency forward and option contracts 
derivative financial contracts involve elements of market and credit risk 
the market risk that results from these contracts relates to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which generally are offset by changes in the value of the underlying assets or liabilities being held 
credit risk relates to the risk of nonperformance by a counterparty to one of our derivative contracts 
we do not believe there is a significant credit risk associated with our hedging activities 
we monitor the counterparties credit ratings and other market data to minimize credit risk 
in addition  we also limit the aggregate contract amount entered into with any one financial institution to mitigate credit risk 
cash flow hedges we use foreign currency forward and option contracts  designated as cash flow hedges  to mitigate currency risk related to an imbalance of nonfunctional currency denominated costs and related revenue 
we conduct monthly effectiveness tests of these hedging relationships on a spot to spot basis  excluding forward points 
effective gains and losses from derivative contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying transactions occur  at which time they are reclassified to total cost of revenue 
ineffectiveness is recorded to other expense income  net 
if it becomes probable that an anticipated transaction that is hedged will not occur  we immediately reclassify the gains or losses related to that hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income to other expense income  net
