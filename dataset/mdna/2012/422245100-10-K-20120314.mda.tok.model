in north america  our customers include health plans  employers  integrated healthcare systems  hospitals  physicians  and government entities in all states  the district of columbia and puerto rico 
we also provide health improvement programs and services in brazil  australia and france 
we operate domestic and international care enhancement and coaching centers staffed with licensed health professionals 
our fitness center network encompasses approximately  us locations 
we also maintain an extensive network of over  complementary  alternative and physical medicine practitioners  which offers convenient access to the significant number of individuals who seek health services outside of the traditional healthcare system 
our guiding philosophy and approach to market is predicated on the fundamental belief that healthier people cost less and are more productive 
as described more fully below  our programs are designed to improve well being by helping people to adopt or maintain healthy behaviors  reduce health related risk factors  and optimize care for identified health conditions 
first  our programs are designed to help people adopt or maintain healthy behaviors by fostering wellness and disease prevention through total population screening  well being assessments and supportive interventions  and providing access to health improvement programs  such as fitness solutions  weight management  chiropractic  and complementary and alternative medicine 
our prevention programs focus on education  physical fitness  health coaching  and behavior change techniques and support 
we believe this approach improves the well being status of member populations and reduces the short and long term direct healthcare costs for participants  including associated costs from the loss of employee productivity 
second  our programs are designed to help people reduce health related risk factors by promoting the change and improvement of the lifestyle behaviors that lead to poor health or chronic conditions  and providing educational materials and personal interactions with highly trained nurses and other healthcare professionals to create and sustain healthier behaviors for those individuals at risk or in the early stages of chronic conditions 
we enable our customers to engage everyone in their covered populations through specific interventions that are sensitive to each individual s health risks and needs 
our programs are designed to motivate people to make positive lifestyle changes and accomplish individual goals  such as increasing physical activity for seniors through the healthways silversneakers fitness solution or overcoming nicotine addiction through the quitnet on line smoking cessation community 
finally  our programs are designed to help people optimize care for identified health conditions by incorporating the latest  evidence based clinical guidelines into interventions to optimize patient health outcomes  developing care support plans and motivating members to set attainable goals for themselves  providing local market resources to address acute episodic interventions  coordinating members care with their healthcare providers  providing software licensing and management consulting in support of well being improvement services  and providing high risk care management for members at risk for hospitalization due to complex conditions 
our approach is to use proprietary  analytic models to identify individuals who are likely to incur future high costs  including those who have specific gaps in care  and through evidence based interventions drive adherence to proven standards of care  medication regimens and physicians plans of care to reduce disease progression and related medical spending 
we recognize that each individual plays a variety of roles in his or her pursuit of health  often simultaneously 
by providing the full spectrum of services to meet each individual s needs  we believe our interventions can be delivered at scale and in a manner that reflects those unique needs over time 
we believe creating real and sustainable behavior change generates measurable  long term cost savings and improved individual and business performance

we undertake no obligation to update or revise any such forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies we describe our accounting policies in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we prepare the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us gaap  which requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical in understanding the estimates and judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
revenue recognition we generally determine our contract fees by multiplying a contractually negotiated pmpm rate by the number of members covered by our services during the month 
we typically set the pmpm rates during contract negotiations with customers based on the value we expect our programs to create and a sharing of that value between the customer and the company 
in addition  some of our services  such as the healthways silversneakers fitness solution  include fees that are based upon member participation 
our contracts with health plans generally range from three to five years with provisions for subsequent renewal  contracts with self insured employers  either directly or through their health plans or pharmacy benefit manager  typically have one to three year terms 
some of our contracts allow the customer to terminate early 
some of our contracts place a portion of our fees at risk based on achieving certain performance metrics  cost savings  and or clinical outcomes improvements performance based 
approximately of revenues recorded during were performance based and were subject to final reconciliation as of december  we anticipate that this percentage will fluctuate due to the level of performance based fees in new contracts and the timing and amount of revenue recognition associated with performance based fees 
we recognize revenue as follows we recognize the fixed portion of pmpm fees and fees for service as revenue during the period we perform our services  and we recognize performance based revenue based on the most recent assessment of our performance  which represents the amount that the customer would legally be obligated to pay if the contract were terminated as of the latest balance sheet date 
we generally bill our customers each month for the entire amount of the fees contractually due for the prior month s enrollment  which typically includes the amount  if any  that is performance based and may be subject to refund should we not meet performance targets 
deferred revenues arise from contracts which permit upfront billing and collection of fees covering the entire contractual service period  generally months 
a limited number of our contracts provide for certain performance based fees that cannot be billed until after they are reconciled with the customer 
fees for service are typically billed in the month after the services are provided 
we assess our level of performance for our contracts based on medical claims and other data that the customer is contractually required to supply 
a minimum of four to nine months data is typically required for us to measure performance 
in assessing our performance  we may include estimates such as medical claims incurred but not reported and a medical cost trend compared to a baseline year 
in addition  we may also provide contractual allowances for billing adjustments such as data reconciliation differences as appropriate 
if data is insufficient or incomplete to measure performance  or interim performance measures indicate that we are not meeting performance targets  we do not recognize performance based fees subject to refund as revenues but instead record them in a current liability account entitled contract billings in excess of earned revenue 
only in the event we do not meet performance levels by the end of the measurement period  typically one year  are we contractually obligated to refund some or all of the performance based fees 
we would only reverse revenues that we had already recognized if performance to date in the measurement period  previously above targeted levels  subsequently dropped below targeted levels 
historically  any such adjustments have been immaterial to our financial condition and results of operations 
during the settlement process under a contract  which generally occurs six to eight months after the end of a contract year  we settle any performance based fees and reconcile healthcare claims and clinical data 
as of december   cumulative performance based revenues that have not yet been settled with our customers but that have been recognized in the current and prior years totaled approximately million  all of which were based on actual data received from our customers 
data reconciliation differences  for which we provide contractual allowances until we reach agreement with respect to identified issues  can arise between the customer and us due to customer data deficiencies  omissions  and or data discrepancies 
performance related adjustments including any amounts recorded as revenue that were ultimately refunded  changes in estimates  or data reconciliation differences may cause us to recognize or reverse revenue in a current fiscal year that pertains to services provided during a prior fiscal year 
during  we recognized a net increase in revenue of million that related to services provided prior to impairment of intangible assets and goodwill we review goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of a discounted cash flow model and a market based approach  and we reconcile the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our consolidated market capitalization 
estimating fair value requires significant judgments  including management s estimate of future cash flows  which is dependent on internal forecasts  estimation of the long term growth rate for our business  the useful life over which cash flows will occur  determination of our weighted average cost of capital  as well as relevant comparable company earnings multiples for the market based approach 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the estimate of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 
if we determine that the carrying value of goodwill is impaired based upon an impairment review  we calculate any impairment using a fair value based goodwill impairment test as required by us gaap 
the fair value of a reporting unit is the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
as a result of changes in our long term projections related to the wind down of our contract with cigna  we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment review during the fourth quarter of and recorded a million goodwill impairment loss 
except for a certain trade name which has an indefinite life and is not subject to amortization  we amortize identifiable intangible assets  such as acquired technologies and customer contracts  using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
we assess the potential impairment of intangible assets subject to amortization whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable 
if we determine that the carrying value of other identifiable intangible assets may not be recoverable  we calculate any impairment using an estimate of the asset s fair value based on the estimated price that would be received to sell the asset in an orderly transaction between market participants 
we review intangible assets not subject to amortization  which consist of a trade name  on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
we estimate the fair value of the trade name using a present value technique  which requires management s estimate of future revenues attributable to this trade name  estimation of the long term growth rate for these revenues  and determination of our weighted average cost of capital 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the estimate of fair value for the trade name 
if we determine that the carrying value of other identifiable intangible assets may not be recoverable  we calculate any impairment using an estimate of the asset s fair value based on the estimated price that would be received to sell the asset in an orderly transaction between market participants 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill and or other intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
income taxes the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
accounting for income taxes requires significant judgment in determining income tax provisions  including determination of deferred tax assets  deferred tax liabilities  and any valuation allowances that might be required against deferred tax assets  and in evaluating tax positions 
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
us gaap also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities  classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions  and income tax disclosures 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
share based compensation we measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards based on estimated fair values at the date of grant 
determining the fair value of stock options at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions  which involve a number of variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and expected stock option exercise behavior 
in addition  we also use judgment in estimating the number of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
business strategy the world health organization defines health as not only the absence of infirmity and disease  but also a state of physical  mental  and social well being 
our business strategy reflects our passion to enhance health and well being  and as a result  reduce overall healthcare costs and improve workforce engagement  yielding better business performance for our customers 
our programs are designed to improve well being by helping people to adopt or maintain healthy behaviors  reduce health related risk factors  and optimize care for identified health conditions 
through our solutions  we work to optimize the health and well being of entire populations  one person at a time  domestically and internationally  thereby creating value by reducing overall healthcare costs and improving productivity and performance for individuals  families  health plans  governments  employers  integrated healthcare systems and communities 
we believe it is critical to impact an entire population s underlying health status and well being in a long term  cost effective way 
believing that what gets measured gets acted upon  in  we entered into an exclusive  year relationship with gallup to provide a national  daily pulse of individual and collective well being 
the gallup healthways well being indextm is the result of a unique partnership in well being measurement and research that is based upon surveys of  americans every day through  with more than million surveys completed to date 
under the agreement  gallup evaluates and reports on the well being of individuals of countries  states and communities  healthways provides similar services for companies  families and individuals 
this relationship was expanded in with the launch of the gallup healthways well being index in the united kingdom and germany  which we believe indicates the growing global interest in gaining clear insights for government and business leaders charged with shaping the policy responses necessary to improve health  increase individual and organizational performance  lower healthcare costs and achieve sustained economic growth 
to enhance health and well being within their respective populations  our current and prospective customers require solutions that focus on the underlying drivers of healthcare demand  address worsening health status  reverse or slow unsustainable cost trends  foster healthy behaviors  mitigate health risk factors  and manage chronic conditions 
our strategy is to deliver programs that engage individuals and help them enhance their health status and well being regardless of their starting point 
we believe we can achieve health and well being improvements in a population and generate significant cost savings and increases in productivity by providing effective programs that support the individual throughout his or her well being journey 
we are adding and enhancing solutions to extend our reach and effectiveness and to meet increasing demand for integrated solutions 
the flexibility of our programs allows customers to provide a range of services they deem appropriate for their organizations 
customers may select from certain single program options up to a total population approach  in which all members of a customer s population are eligible to receive our services 
recently signed contracts have expanded both the level of integration and breadth of services provided to major health plans as they develop and implement a number of patient centered medical home models 
our services extend beyond chronic care and wellness programs to include care management and pharmacy benefit management  as well as health promotion  prevention and quality improvement solutions 
our strategy includes  as a priority  the ongoing expansion of our value proposition through our total population management solution 
this solution  in addition to improving individuals health and reducing direct healthcare costs  targets a much larger improvement in employer profitability by reducing the impact of lost productivity for health related reasons 
with the success of our total population management solution  we expect to gain an even greater competitive advantage in responding to employers needs for a healthier  higher performing and less costly workforce 
our strategy also includes the further enhancement and deployment of our proprietary next generation technology platform known as embrace 
this platform  which is essential to our total population management solution  enables us to integrate data from the healthcare organizations and other entities interacting with an individual 
embrace provides for the delivery of our integrated solutions and ongoing communications between the individual and his or her medical and health experts  using a range of methods  including venue based face to face  print  phone  mobile and remote devices  on line  emerging modalities  and any combination thereof 
significant changes in government regulation of healthcare are affording us expanding opportunities to provide services to integrated healthcare systems  hospitals  and physicians in addition to health plans and employers 
we provide integrated healthcare systems both consultative strategic planning services and a broad range of capabilities that support the operation of healthcare delivery systems  including our total population health solutions 
we plan to increase our competitive advantage in delivering our services by leveraging our scalable  state of the art call centers  medical information content  behavior change processes and techniques  strategic relationships  healthcare provider networks  fitness center relationships  and proprietary technologies and techniques 
we may add new capabilities and technologies through internal development  strategic alliances with other entities  and or selective acquisitions or investments 
recent examples include our collaboration with blue zones in delivering a scaled well being improvement solution to support the healthiest state initiative in iowa  our investment in our wholly owned subsidiary meyou health in bringing to market well being improvement tools in the social media space through web and personal device delivery methods  and our expanded strategic relationship with johns hopkins medicine to commercialize the sustained weight loss program innergy resulting from a three year clinical trial conducted by the national heart  lung and blood institute 
we anticipate continuing to enhance  expand and integrate additional capabilities with health plans and to pursue opportunities with employers  domestic government entities  and communities as well as the public and private sectors of healthcare in international markets 
results of operations the following table shows the components of the statements of operations for the fiscal years ended december   and expressed as a percentage of revenues 
year ended december  revenues cost of services exclusive of depreciation and amortization included below selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization impairment loss restructuring and related charges operating income loss gain on sale of investment interest expense legal settlement income loss before income taxes income tax expense net income loss figures may not add due to rounding 
revenues revenues for fiscal decreased million  or  over fiscal  primarily due to the following the recognition of revenues in in connection with a final settlement with cms associated with our participation in two mhs programs  and contract and program terminations and restructurings with certain customers 
these decreases were somewhat offset by revenue from new and expanded contracts and an increase in participation in our fitness center programs as well as in the number of members eligible to participate in such programs 
revenues for fiscal increased million  or  over fiscal  primarily due to the following the commencement of contracts with new customers  the recognition of revenues in connection with a final settlement with cms associated with our participation in two mhs programs  and an increase in participation in our fitness center programs as well as in the number of members eligible to participate in such programs 
these increases were somewhat offset by decreases in revenues primarily due to the following contract restructurings and terminations with certain customers  and a decrease in performance based revenues due to our inability to measure and achieve performance targets on certain contracts during fiscal cost of services cost of services excluding depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenues for fiscal increased to compared to for fiscal  primarily due to the following costs associated with implementing certain significant new and innovative contracts  an increase in implementation expenses primarily related to our embrace platform  an increased portion of our revenue generated by fitness solutions  which typically have a higher cost of services as a percentage of revenue than our other programs  changes in the contract structure of certain incentive based wellness programs from a utilization model to a pmpm model  as well as an increase in the number of members eligible for these programs and their utilization of such programs  and costs associated with an initiative to promote member participation in our fitness solutions 
these increases were somewhat offset by the following decreases in cost of services excluding depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenues a decrease in the level of short and long term performance based incentive compensation based on the company s financial performance against established internal targets for these periods  a decrease in salaries and benefits expense  primarily due to a restructuring of the company  which was completed during the fourth quarter of  and cost savings related to certain operational efficiencies 
cost of services excluding depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenues for fiscal decreased to compared to for fiscal  primarily due to the following a decrease in the level of short term incentive compensation based on the company s year to date financial performance against established internal targets for these periods  a decrease in salaries and benefits expense  primarily due to a restructuring of the company  which was largely completed during the fourth quarter of calendar but for which some employee terminations continued into early  certain employee reductions in  and a net decrease in health insurance costs related to changes in employee medical plan design  which included a number of wellness initiatives aimed at improving employee health  in  and cost savings related to certain operational efficiencies 
these decreases were somewhat offset by the following increases in cost of services as a percentage of revenues an increase in consulting expenses primarily related to implementation of our embrace platform and the implementation of our first total population health contract  and a higher portion of our revenue being generated by fitness center and certain health improvement programs  which typically have a higher cost of services as a percentage of revenue than our other programs 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal  primarily due to the following a decrease in the level of long term performance based incentive compensation during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   based on the company s financial performance against established internal targets for these periods  and cost savings realized during from a restructuring of the company that was largely completed during the fourth quarter of these decreases were somewhat offset by increased costs involved in pursuing business in evolving markets 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues remained relatively consistent for fiscal compared to fiscal depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense decreased for fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily related to certain computer software that has become fully depreciated since december   slightly offset by increased depreciation expense resulting from the implementation of our embrace platform 
depreciation and amortization expense increased for fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to increased depreciation expense resulting from the implementation of our embrace platform and other capital expenditures related to computer software  somewhat offset by a decrease in amortization expense related to certain intangible assets that became fully amortized in november restructuring and related charges and impairment loss during fiscal  we incurred net charges of million related to a restructuring of the company in the fourth quarter of  which primarily consisted of one time termination benefits and costs associated with capacity reductions following cigna s decision to wind down its contract beginning in also during fiscal  we incurred charges of million primarily related to an impairment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of during fiscal  we incurred net charges of million related to a restructuring of the company in the fourth quarter of  which primarily consisted of one time termination benefits and costs associated with both domestic and international capacity consolidation 
gain on sale of investment in january  a private company in which we held preferred stock was acquired by a third party 
as part of this sale  we received two payments totaling million and recorded a gain of million during the first quarter of during the second quarter of  we recognized a gain of million related to the receipt of a final escrow payment 
interest expense interest expense for fiscal decreased million compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of a decrease in floating interest rates on outstanding borrowings during fiscal compared to fiscal interest expense for fiscal decreased million compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of a decrease in floating interest rates on outstanding borrowings as well as a lower average level of outstanding borrowings during fiscal compared to fiscal legal settlement and related costs in march  the company entered into a settlement of a qui tam lawsuit filed in on behalf of the united states government related to the company s former diabetes treatment center of america business 
as a result of the settlement  which was effective as of april   we incurred a charge of approximately million in  including a million payment to the united states government and a payment of approximately million for other costs and fees related to the settlement  including the estimated legal costs and expenses of the plaintiff s attorneys 
income tax expense in we had positive income tax expense of million despite a pre tax loss of million primarily due to the impairment loss of million  the majority of which was not deductible for tax purposes 
in our effective tax rate was 
our effective tax rate decreased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal  primarily due to the relatively small base of pretax income for fiscal in relation to certain unrecognized tax benefits and non deductible expenses  in addition to the favorable impact on the effective tax rate of two earn out adjustments recorded during fiscal these favorable impacts on the effective tax rate were partially offset by an increase during in the level of certain expenses related to international operations for which we do not receive a tax benefit 
outlook we anticipate that revenues for will remain relatively consistent with primarily due to increased revenues from new and expanded contracts and an increase in participation in our fitness center programs as well as in the number of members eligible to participate in such programs  offset by the wind down of our current contract with cigna beginning in in advance of the contract s expiration in february we expect cost of services as a percentage of revenues for to increase compared to primarily due to the wind down of our current contract with cigna and certain contract or program terminations with three smaller health plan customers  all of which carried a lower than average cost of services as a percentage of revenues 
in addition  we anticipate that the level of performance based fees will increase in compared to  and a portion of these fees may not be recognized until the following year  whereas the related costs will be incurred and recognized in the current year 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues for to decrease compared to primarily due to cost savings from a restructuring of the company that was largely completed during the fourth quarter of we anticipate depreciation and amortization expense for will increase compared to primarily due to continued investment in our embrace platform 
we anticipate that quarterly revenues and earnings will increase sequentially throughout primarily due to the timing of recognizing performance based fees 
as discussed in liquidity and capital resources below  a significant portion of our long term debt is subject to fixed interest rate swap agreements  however  we cannot predict the potential for changes in interest rates  which would impact our variable rate debt 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities for fiscal generated cash of million compared to million for fiscal the increase in operating cash flow resulted primarily from the following a payment made during fiscal to cms as part of a final settlement related to our participation in two mhs programs  and lower income tax payments during fiscal primarily due to overpayments made in these increases were somewhat offset by decreases in operating cash flow primarily related to decreased cash collections on accounts receivable for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  investing activities during fiscal used million in cash  which primarily consisted of capital expenditures associated with our embrace platform and the acquisition of navvis 
financing activities during fiscal provided million in cash primarily due to net borrowings under the fourth amended credit agreement and the exercise of stock options  somewhat offset by repurchases of our common stock 
on march   we entered into the fourth amended credit agreement 
the fourth amended credit agreement provides us with the revolving credit facility  which is a million revolving credit facility that expires december  and includes a swingline sub facility of million and a million sub facility for letters of credit 
the fourth amended credit agreement also provides a continuation of the term loan facility provided pursuant to the third amended and restated credit agreement  of which million remained outstanding on december   and an uncommitted incremental accordion facility of million 
as of december   availability under the revolving credit facility totaled million as calculated under the most restrictive covenant 
revolving advances under the revolving credit facility generally bear interest  at our option  at libor plus a spread of to or the greater of the federal funds rate plus  or the prime rate  plus a spread of to 
term loan borrowings bear interest  at our option  at libor plus or the greater of the federal funds rate plus  or the prime rate 
see below for a description of our interest rate swap agreements 
the fourth amended credit agreement also provides for a fee ranging between and of the unused commitments under the revolving credit facility 
the fourth amended credit agreement is secured by guarantees from most of the company s domestic subsidiaries and by security interests in substantially all of the company s and such subsidiaries assets 
we are required to repay outstanding revolving loans under the revolving credit facility on december  we are required to repay term loans in quarterly principal installments aggregating million each  which commenced on march  the entire unpaid principal balance of the term loans is due and payable at maturity on december  the fourth amended credit agreement contains various financial covenants  which require us to maintain  as defined  ratios or levels of total funded debt to ebitda  fixed charge coverage  and net worth 
the fourth amended credit agreement also restricts the payment of dividends and limits the amount of repurchases of the company s common stock 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of the covenant requirements of the fourth amended credit agreement 
in order to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations on our floating rate debt commitments  we maintain interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of million million of which became effective in january  million of which became effective in february  and million of which will become effective in january and termination dates ranging from december  to december  under these agreements  we receive a variable rate of interest based on libor  and we pay a fixed rate of interest 
these interest rate swap agreements effectively modify our exposure to interest rate risk by converting a portion of our floating rate debt to fixed obligations with interest rates ranging from to plus a spread  thus reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense 
we believe that cash flows from operating activities  our available cash  and our anticipated available credit under the fourth amended credit agreement will continue to enable us to meet our contractual obligations and to fund our current operations for the foreseeable future 
however  if our operations require significant additional financing resources  such as capital expenditures for technology improvements  additional call centers and or letters of credit or other forms of financial assurance to guarantee our performance under the terms of new contracts  or if we are required to refund performance based fees pursuant to contract terms  we may need to raise additional capital by expanding our existing credit facility and or issuing debt or equity 
if we face a limited ability to arrange such financing  it may restrict our ability to effectively operate our business 
we cannot assure you that we would always be able to secure additional financing if needed and  if such funds were available  whether the terms or conditions would be acceptable to us 
as noted above  we are required to repay outstanding revolving and term loans under the fourth amended credit agreement on or before december  total borrowings under this agreement were million as of december  we anticipate that we will amend the terms or refinance the borrowings under the fourth amended credit agreement prior to its expiration 
however  we cannot assure you that we will be able to amend the terms or refinance the borrowings under the fourth amended credit agreement in an amount sufficient  or on terms acceptable  to us 
if contract development accelerates or acquisition opportunities arise  we may need to issue additional debt or equity to provide the funding for these increased growth opportunities 
we may also issue equity in connection with future acquisitions or strategic alliances 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to issue additional debt or equity on terms that would be acceptable to us 
contractual obligations the following schedule summarizes our contractual cash obligations by the indicated period as of december  payments due by year ended december  in s and after total deferred compensation plan payments long term debt operating lease obligations capital lease obligations purchase obligations outsourcing obligations other contractual cash obligations total contractual cash obligations includes payments under a non qualified deferred compensation plan and long term performance cash awards
