table of contents executive overview marketing  promotional and advertising spending by consumer products companies and retailers drives a majority of the company s revenues 
the markets served are primarily consumer products  pharmaceutical  entertainment and retail 
the company s principal business in this area involves producing graphic images for various applications 
generally  the company or a third party creates an image and then the image is manipulated to enhance the color and to prepare it for print 
the applications vary from consumer product packaging  including food and beverage packaging images  to retail advertisements in newspapers  including freestanding inserts fsis  magazine advertisements and the internet 
the graphics process is generally the same regardless of the application 
the following steps in the graphics process must take place to produce a final image strategic analysis planning and messaging conceptual design content creation file building retouching art production pre media the company s involvement with a client s project may involve all of the above steps or just one of the steps  depending on the client s needs 
each client assignment  or job  is a custom job in that the image being produced is unique  even if it only involves a small change from an existing image  such as adding a low fat banner on a food package 
essentially  such changes equal new revenue for schawk 
the company is paid for its graphic imaging work regardless of the success or failure of the food product  the promotion or the ad campaign 
historically  a substantial majority of the company s revenues have been derived from providing graphic services for consumer product packaging applications 
packaging changes occur with regular frequency and lack of advance notice  and client turn around requirements are tight  thereby creating little backlog 
there are regular promotions throughout the year that create revenue opportunities for the company  such as valentine s day  easter  fourth of july  back to school  halloween  thanksgiving and christmas 
in addition  there are event driven promotions that occur regularly  such as the super bowl  grammy awards  world series  indianapolis and the olympics 
changing regulatory requirements also necessitate new packaging from time to time  as do the number of health related banners that are added to food and beverage packaging  such as heart healthy  low in carbohydrates  enriched with essential vitamins  low in saturated fat and caffeine free 
all of these items require new product packaging designs or changes in existing designs  in each case creating additional opportunities for revenue 
graphic services for the consumer products packaging industry generally involve higher margins due to the substantial expertise necessary to meet consumer products companies precise specifications and to quickly  consistently and efficiently bring their products to market  as well as due to the complexity and variety of packaging materials  shapes and sizes  custom colors and storage conditions 
through several acquisitions in and  the company increased the percentage of its revenue derived from providing graphics services to advertising and retail clients and added to its service offering graphic services to the entertainment market 
these clients typically require high volume  commodity oriented premedia graphic services 
graphic services for these clients typically yield relatively lower margins due to the lower degree of complexity in providing such services  and the number and size of companies in the industry capable of providing such services 
in  approximately percent of the company s total revenues came from its largest single client 
while the company seeks to build long term client relationships  revenues from any particular client can fluctuate from period to period due to the client s purchasing patterns 
any termination of or significant reduction in the company business relationship with any of its principal clients could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
during  the company expects to continue to implement operational and work force alignment actions  including a focused initiative to realign the company s management and organizational structure to provide  among other things  greater consistency and more common approaches to the services the company provides to its clients 
while the company anticipates these actions will benefit the company and its clients  changes to its organizational structure also may result in increased or unanticipated short term costs due to the realignment of responsibilities  roles and personnel functions

management believes that the level of working capital is adequate for the company s liquidity needs related to normal operations both currently and in the foreseeable future  and that the company has sufficient resources to support its operations  either through currently available cash and cash generated from future operations  or pursuant to its current credit facility

the company s total contractual obligations total approximately million  including all debt obligations see contractual obligation table below 
at this time  the company believes that cash flow from operations and its continued ability to refinance its maturing debt obligations will be sufficient to finance the company during the next five years  assuming no significant business acquisitions 
if a significant acquisition is undertaken in the next five years  the company would likely need to access the debt and equity markets to finance such an acquisition

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of its financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes that the following are the most critical accounting estimates that could have an effect on schawk s reported results 
accounts receivable 
the company s clients are primarily consumer product manufacturers  advertising agencies  retailers  both grocery and non grocery  and entertainment companies 
accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due to schawk from its normal business activities 
the company s allowance for doubtful accounts is determined using assumptions of minimum reserve requirement percentages applied to the aging of the company s trade accounts receivable  along with specific reserves for known collection issues 
for example  the aging based portion of the company s reserve is determined by applying a percent reserve to amounts overdue by more than days  a percent reserve to amounts overdue by more than days and a percent reserve for amounts overdue by more than days 
in the company s experience  this policy as supplemented by specific reserves for known collection issues  broadly captures the credit risk in its receivables 
based on the company s estimates and assumptions  an allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos of million was established at december   compared to an allowance of million at december  a change in the company s assumptions would result in the company recovering an amount of its accounts receivable that differs from the carrying value 
any difference could result in an increase or decrease in bad debt expense 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company records impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
events that may indicate that certain long lived assets might be impaired might include a significant downturn in the economy or the consumer packaging industry  a loss of a major customer or several customers  a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  a significant adverse change in the manner in which an asset is used or an adverse change in the physical condition of an asset 
the company tests long lived assets for impairment when facts and circumstances have changed and a potential impairment trigger is indicated 
impairment is evaluated by a comparison of the carrying value of an asset to the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if this comparison indicates that an asset is impaired  the loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value 
the company s impairment losses in regard to long lived assets have in recent years primarily related to surplus properties resulting from restructuring ie  facility consolidation actions 
for significant losses  the company estimates fair value based on market valuation studies performed by qualified third party valuation experts 
assumptions used in estimating cash flows include among other things those assumptions concerning periods of operation and projections of revenues and costs of revenues  industry trends and market interest rates 
there are inherent uncertainties associated with the judgments and estimates used in assessing asset impairment and it is possible that impairment charges recognized in a given period would differ if the assessment was made in a different period 
during  the company recorded an impairment charge of less than million for various fixed assets 
the expense is reflected as an impairment of long lived assets in the consolidated statements of operations at december  a change in the company s business climate in future periods  including a significant downturn in the company s operations  could lead to a required assessment of the recoverability of the company s long lived assets  resulting in future additional impairment charges 
goodwill and other acquired intangible assets 
the company has made acquisitions in the past that included a significant amount of goodwill  customer relationships and  to a lesser extent  other intangible assets 
goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an annual or under certain circumstances more frequent impairment test based on its estimated fair value 
other intangible assets  including customer relationships  are amortized over their useful lives and are tested for impairment when facts and circumstances have changed and a potential impairment trigger is indicated 
events that may indicate potential impairment include a loss of  or a significant decrease in volume from  a major customer  a change in the expected useful life of an asset  a change in the market value of an asset  a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate  unanticipated competition relative to a major customer or the loss of key personnel relative to a major customer 
impairment is evaluated in a recoverability test including a comparison of the carrying value of an asset to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if this comparison indicates that an acquired intangible asset is impaired  the loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value 
the company performs a goodwill impairment test annually  or when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the company performs its annual impairment test as of october each year 
the company performed its and goodwill impairment tests as of october  and  respectively  and determined that no impairment of goodwill was indicated for either year 
for both years  the company performed its annual impairment review on a geographic basis at the operating segment level 
the company has determined that its operating segments are also its reporting units for goodwill testing in accordance with financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification topic no 
 intangibles goodwill and other asc 
using projection of operating cash flow for each reporting unit  the company performed a step one assessment of the fair value of each reporting unit using the income approach ie discounted cash flow  or dcf  as compared to the carrying value of each reporting unit 
in addition  the company utilized a market approach  which assumes that companies operating in the same industry will share similar characteristics and the company values will correlate to those characteristics  to validate the results of the income approach valuations 
however  due to lack of comparable industry data  the company ultimately relied on the income approach in arriving at the fair value of the reporting units 
the dcf method was used due to company specific growth and profitability factors best captured in management s projections  which are considered most representative of the future outlook for the reporting units 

table of contents the step one impairment analysis for the october  test indicated no potential impairment of the assigned goodwill 
the following table summarizes the results of the company s step one impairment analysis as of october  in millions americas europe asia pacific total fair value of reporting unit carrying value of reporting unit percentage fair value over carrying value goodwill allocated to reporting unit based on the september  closing price of the company s common stock  the company had a market capitalization of million  compared to its estimated fair value of million  which indicates an implied control premium of approximately percent 
at october   the company s stock price had declined  along with the general stock market  to the point where the fair value of the company  as determined by its market capitalization  was less than the company s book value 
while the company concluded that the decline was temporary and based on general economic and volatile market conditions  and not based on any events or conditions specific to the company  if the price of the company s common stock were to experience a significant and other than temporary decline  the company may be required in a future period to recognize an impairment of all or a portion of its goodwill 
the discounted cash flow model used for the income valuation approach was based on the company s ten year projections of operating income for each reporting unit 
projections for the first five years were consistent with the company s five year business plan as approved by the company s board of directors and utilized for financing discussions and transactions with current and prospective lenders 
the company s ten year projection assumes revenue growth of percent annually  with a commensurate increase in operating expenses 
the discount rates used for the cash flow model varied from percent to percent  by reporting unit 
in evaluating the recoverability of goodwill  it is necessary to estimate the fair value of the reporting units 
in making this assessment  the company s management relies on a number of factors to discount anticipated future cash flows  including operating results  business plans and present value techniques 
there are inherent uncertainties in the assumptions and estimates used in developing future cash flows and management s judgment is required in applying these assumptions and estimates to the analysis of goodwill impairment  including projecting revenues and profits  interest rates  cost of capital  tax rates  the corporation s stock price and the allocation of shared or corporate items 
many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management and it is reasonably likely that assumptions and estimates will change from period to period 
these changes may result in future impairments 
for example  the company s revenue growth rate could be lower than projected due to economic  industry or competitive factors or the discount rate used in the company s cash flow model could increase due to a change in market interest rates 
additionally  future goodwill impairment charges may be necessary if the company s market capitalization decreased due to a decline in the trading price of the company s common stock 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences and net operating losses will not be realized 
federal  state and foreign tax authorities regularly audit schawk  like other multi national companies  and tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed 
effective january   the company adopted the provisions of income taxes topic of the codification  asc  that contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits  which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 
actual outcomes could result in a change in reported income tax expense for a particular period 
for example  the company s effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries which have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries which have higher statutory rates  by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities  or by changes in the relevant tax  accounting or other laws  regulations  principles and interpretations 
the company is subject to audit in various jurisdictions  and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax against it 
although the company believes its tax estimates are reasonable  the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from its historical income tax provisions and accruals 
the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on the company s operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 
see item  note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

table of contents the company has provided valuation allowances against deferred tax assets  primarily arising from the acquisition of seven in  due to the dormancy of the companies generating the tax assets or due to income tax rules limiting the availability of the losses to offset future taxable income 
during  the company released approximately million of certain valuation allowances that were no longer needed  principally for certain of the company s united kingdom and australian subsidiaries 
exit reserves 
the company records reserves for the consolidation of workforce and facilities of acquired companies 
the exit plans are approved by company management prior to  or shortly after  the acquisition date 
the exit plans provide for severance pay  lease abandonment costs and other related expenses 
a change in any of the assumptions used to estimate the exit reserves that result in a decrease to the reserve would result in a decrease to goodwill 
any change in assumptions that result in an increase to the exit reserves would result in a charge to income 
at december   the company had exit reserves of approximately million that were included in accrued expenses and other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets  for exit activities completed in and  primarily for facility closure costs 
future increases or decreases in these reserves are possible  as the company continues to assess changes in circumstance that would alter the future cost assumptions used in the calculation of the reserves 
exit reserves are adjusted when facts regarding a particular reserve have changed  indicating that the original reserve assumptions are no longer valid 
for example  the sublease assumptions originally used in computing a reserve for a vacant leased property could become invalid because of a change in circumstances of a sublease tenant  requiring a recalculation of the correct reserve balance 
however  the company believes that  because the current exit reserves are diminishing  any further changes to the exit reserves would be immaterial to its consolidated financial statements
