actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward looking statements and future results could differ materially from historical performance 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap and follow general practices within the financial services industry in which it operates 
management  in order to prepare the company s consolidated financial statements  is required to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the balance sheet date through the date the financial statements are filed with the sec 
as this information changes  the consolidated financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than 
table of contents originally reported 
estimates  assumptions  and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the company are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  the company has identified the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  evaluation of goodwill for potential impairment  and accounting for income taxes as critical accounting policies 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheet 
goodwill has been recorded on the books of the company in connection with its acquisitions 
goodwill is reviewed for potential impairment on an annual basis  or more often if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level and an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
various market valuation methodologies are used to determine the fair value of the reporting unit 
if the fair value of the reporting units exceeds its book values  no write downs of recorded goodwill are necessary 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its book value  an impairment expense may be required to be recorded to write down the related goodwill to the proper carrying value 
as a result of the company s annual goodwill testing  the company recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of  during the quarter ended december   which resulted from several factors  the most prominent being decreases in trading multiples of the company s common stock  overall valuations of comparable organizations  a deterioration in asset quality of the commercial real estate portfolio  and the negative impact of deteriorating asset quality on expected cash flows 
the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future effects of temporary differences and tax credits 
enacted tax rates are applied to cumulative temporary differences based on expected taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability is anticipated to be realized 
future tax rate changes could occur that would require the recognition of income or expense in the statement of operations in the period in which they are enacted 
deferred tax assets must be reduced by a valuation allowance if in management s judgment it is more likely than not that some portion of the asset will not be realized 
management may need to modify their judgments in this regard from one period to another should a material change occur in the business environment  tax legislation  or in any other business factor that could impair the company s ability to benefit from the asset in the future 
as of december   management has concluded that a valuation allowance is not needed on its net deferred tax asset 
readers of the consolidated financial statements should be aware that the estimates and assumptions used in the company s current financial statements may need to be updated in future financial presentations for changes in circumstances  business or economic conditions in order to fairly represent the condition of the company at that time 

table of contents corporate profile and significant developments the company is a financial holding company headquartered in shippensburg  pennsylvania with consolidated assets of  at december  the consolidated financial information presented herein reflects the company and its wholly owned commercial bank subsidiary  the bank 
the bank  with total assets of  at december   is a pennsylvania chartered commercial bank with offices 
twenty of those offices are located in pennsylvania and one in maryland 
on may   the company acquired the first national bank of newport  located in perry county  pennsylvania 
on june   the first national bank of newport was merged into the bank 
the bank s deposit services include a variety of checking  savings  time and money market deposits along with related debit card and merchant services 
lending services include commercial loans  residential loans  commercial mortgages and various forms of consumer lending 
orrstown financial advisors  a division of the bank  offers a diverse line of financial services to our customers  including  but not limited to  brokerage  mutual funds  trusts  estate planning  investments and insurance products 
at december   approximately  of assets under management were serviced by orrstown financial advisors 
economic climate  inflation and interest rates during  the us economy faced significant challenges resulting in an overall economic downturn 
poor economic conditions  which were initially evident within the residential housing market beginning in  spread throughout most sectors of the economy in the economic malaise has continued through the majority of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature  and therefore  differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories 
however  inflation does have an impact on the growth of total assets and on noninterest expenses  which tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
inflationary pressures over the last five years have been modest  although the potential for future inflationary pressure is present given changing trends in the economy 
as the company s balance sheet consists primarily of financial instruments  interest income and interest expense is greatly influenced by the interest rates and the slope of the interest rate curve 
during the five years presented in this financial statement review  interest rates were relatively high when the economy was perceived as strong  however  as the national and local economy began experiencing financial difficulties and higher levels of unemployment  rates decreased quickly 
one example of this is the prime lending rate  which reached a high during the five year period of in september however  the prime lending rate was reduced basis points over a month period  coinciding with the country s economic struggles  and ended with a published prime lending rate of 
the published prime lending rate remained at at december  management recognizes that asset liability management  including the effect of rate changes on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  is of critical importance 
despite the challenging economic conditions during and into  the company believes it is positioned to withstand these conditions through its strong capital and liquidity positions  high quality loan and debt securities portfolios and prudent management of credit and interest rate risk 
results of operations summary for the year ended december   the company incurred a net loss of  compared to net income of  and  in and  resulting in diluted earnings loss per share of  and for the years  and as a result of the net loss for  the company s return on assets and return on tangible equity ratios were negative for the year  compared to and respectively for  and and in net loss excluding goodwill impairment  net of tax  was  for the year ended december   and diluted loss per share excluding goodwill impairment charge was for the period 

table of contents in addition to the nonrecurring goodwill impairment charge  the company s performance for the year was also negatively affected by a significantly elevated level of the provision for loan losses which totaled  for the year ended december  compared to  and  recorded in and the increase in risk assets experienced in  which include nonaccrual loans  restructured loans and real estate owned  resulted in increases in staff to work through these assets and mitigate the company s risk of loss  as well as other noninterest expenses 
the company was able to increase its net interest income to  for the year ended december   compared to  and  in and  however this increase was not sufficient to offset the goodwill impairment charge and the elevated provision for loan losses 
net interest income the primary component of the company s revenue is net interest income  which is the difference between interest income and fees on interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
earning assets include loans  securities and federal funds sold 
interest bearing liabilities include deposits and borrowed funds 
to compare the tax exempt yields to taxable yields  amounts are adjusted to pretax equivalents based on a federal corporate tax rate 
net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates  volumes of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the composition of those assets and liabilities 
the net interest spread and net interest margin nim are two common statistics related to changes in net interest income 
the net interest rate spread represents the difference between the yields earned on interest earning assets and the rates paid for interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest margin is defined as the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets 
through the use of demand deposits and stockholders equity  the net interest margin exceeds the net interest rate spread  as these funding sources are non interest bearing 
the analysis of net interest income table presents net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis  net interest rate spread and net interest margin for the years ending december   and the changes in taxable equivalent net interest income table below analyzes the changes in net interest income for the same periods broken down by their rate and volume components 
versus for the year ended december  net interest income  measured on a fully tax equivalent basis  increased  or  to  from  in the primary reason for the increase in net interest income was an increase in average earning assets from  in to  in slightly offsetting the growth in volume was a decrease in net interest margin nim of basis points  from in to for as summarized on the rate volume table   of the growth in net interest income was achieved from volume  offset by a decrease of  attributable to the decrease in nim 
the largest portion of the increase in interest income was the result of interest earned on the securities portfolio  which totaled  for the year ended december   an increase of  or  over year over year  average securities increased  or 
supplementing the increase on securities earnings due to volume was an increase in the interest rate earned of in to in the higher yield on securities despite a generally lower interest rate environment was the result of the mix of the securities  in which a greater proportion of securities was invested in tax exempt securities  which generally yield higher returns on a tax equivalent basis 
in the fourth quarter of  the company has experienced contraction in the yield earned on securities  which totaled for the period  less than the average earned in management anticipates a lower yield in as interest rates are forecasted to remain low  and as securities mature  they will be reinvested at lower rates 

table of contents the growth in securities was funded principally through the growth in money market and time deposit accounts 
average interest bearing deposits increased  or  resulting from the company s overall customer service model  its market position in several attractive markets  and due to the favorable rating the bank has received from idc financial publishing  inc idc  an independent bank safety rating agency which uses its unique rankings of financial ratios to determine the quality ratings of financial institutions 
this favorable rating facilitated the company s ability to attract time deposits and brokered deposits  particularly in the first half of the year 
despite an increase in the average balance of time deposits of  for the year ended december  compared to  the total interest expense was lowered by  the average volume resulted in an increase of interest expense of  which was more than offset by the decrease in interest expense of  that resulted from a basis points decrease in the yield paid on time deposits from to the company recognizes that brokered funds are a more volatile funding source than core deposits 
however  given the current interest rate environment and the steepness of the interest rate curve  the company elected to collect these funds and earn a spread on them in order to enhance net interest income 
given the increased volatility in brokered deposits  the company invested a large portion of these amounts in mortgage backed securities  which provide a regular stream of monthly cash flows  which can be used to meet the maturity needs of time and brokered deposits 
we have matched cash flows from the debt securities portfolio with brokered deposits to enable us to unwind the strategy if loan demand increased or if the yield curve flattens 
as a result of the recent regulatory climate related to nontraditional funding sources  management anticipates it will not utilize brokered deposits as heavily in the future  and we anticipate that brokered deposits will decline  which will likely result in a decline in the securities portfolio as well 
the year over year growth in the loan portfolio also contributed to the increase in net interest income 
year over year  average loans increased  or  from the year ended december  to december  the growth experienced in the loan portfolio in the second half of  supplemented with the loan demand in the first quarter of  provided the strong growth in average loan balances 
this growth has come principally in some of the company s less mature markets  in which we have hired additional lending officers  which has increased opportunities for growth in these markets served 
in light of deteriorating asset quality conditions during the second half of however  the company curbed its loan growth in order to address and enhance credit administration and underwriting processes and procedures  and at year end  loan growth remained flat on a year over year basis 
the  growth in average balances of loans contributed  in additional interest income in compared to however  the rate earned on loans of was basis points less than in  and offset interest income by  resulting in a net increase of  for the year 
the lower yield earned on loans was the result of several factors  including generally a lower interest rate environment in than  greater number of loans on nonaccrual status  and approximately  that was earned in on the company s floating for fixed rate interest rate swaps that was included in interest income  compared to  in during  the company settled its outstanding floating for fixed rate swaps which qualified as cash flow hedges  and negatively impacted loan yields 
due to the variable nature of a large portion of the loan portfolio  along with the implementation of floors as loans renewed  the company was able to limit the decline in the average rate earned on loans 
management does not expect it will continue to experience the same level of growth in loans that it did in and the beginning of  given competitive conditions and the regulatory climate 
the increase in the company s nonaccrual loan balances will also put continued pressure on the rate earned on loans in as noted above  the company has been able to increase its deposit base 
part of the increase in the average balance in deposits was the result of certain customers  whose accounts migrated from repurchase agreements and were previously included as short term borrowings in the balance sheet 
these deposits continue to be secured through pledged securities  however  due to regulatory pressure related to non traditional funding sources  which include repurchase agreements  we enhanced our interest bearing demand product to have them migrate to a funding source viewed as more traditional 
this strategy resulted in a decline in the average balance of short term borrowings from  for the year ended december  to  which resulted in lower interest expense of  on a year over year basis  while a slight decline in rates paid of basis points to basis points between the two periods also resulted in  of the lower interest expense 

table of contents the company has placed less reliance on more costly long term borrowings in as compared to as a result  interest expense on long term debt decreased  from  for the year ended december  to  in reduction in average daily balance of  for compared to reduced interest expense by  and the reduction in the rate paid on long term borrowing of basis points reduced interest expense by  generally lower interest rates for the year ended december  compared to  combined with an increase in nonaccrual loans  has resulted in the company experiencing declines in net interest spread and net interest margin 
despite the low interest rate environment  the company has been able to manage its blend of interest earning assets and liabilities so that the net interest margin has only declined marginally  from for the year ended december  to in  which included the lowering of its overall cost of funds 
the average rates earned on assets was for the year ended december  compared to in  whereas the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities declined from in to in this resulted in a net interest rate spread of in compared to in versus for the year ended december  net interest income  measured on a full tax equivalent basis  increased  or  to  from  in the primary reason for the increase in net interest income was an increase in average earning assets from  in to  in supplementing the growth in volume was an increase in net interest margin of basis points  from in to for as summarized on the rate volume table   of the growth in net interest income was achieved from volume  and  was achieved through an increase in net interest margin 
the largest portion of the increase in interest income was the result of interest earned on the securities portfolio  which totaled  for the year ended december   an increase of  or  over year over year  average securities increased  or 
partially offsetting the increase on securities earnings due to volume was a reduction in the average interest rate earned from in to in the growth in the securities portfolio was funded principally through the growth in money market and time deposit accounts 
average interest bearing deposits increased  or  resulting from the company s overall customer service model  its market position in several attractive markets  and due to the bank s favorable idc rating

the growth in the loan portfolio also contributed to the increase in net interest income 
year over year  average loans increased  or  from the year ended december  to december  the increase in average loans was the result of the company s desire to continue to grow its loan portfolio and deploy its capital 
this growth came principally in some of the company s less mature markets  in which we have hired additional lending officers  which has increased opportunities in these markets served 
the growth experienced in the loan portfolio was achieved primarily in the second half of the year  in which approximately two thirds of the growth was achieved 
the  growth in average balance in loans contributed  in additional interest income in compared to however  the rate earned on loans of was basis points less than in  resulting in a decrease in interest income by  the company continued to have  in notional amount of interest rate swaps which serve as a hedge against variable

provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses for the year ended december  totaled  a significant increase over the prior year s amount of  the factors attributable to the increase in the provision for loan losses included the following an additional charge off of approximately  on a previously reported commercial credit in which the borrower is currently in bankruptcy 
as a result of the bank s recent termination of its involvement with the borrower s plan of reorganization exit financing  it was determined prudent to charge off the entire loan balance  as the bank is presently listed as an unsecured non priority claimant in the pre petition indebtedness 
prolonged softening real estate conditions  particularly in the bank s southern market  have resulted in additional loan loss provisions  as the allowance for loan losses was increased by approximately  after partial charge offs that related to borrowings that were collateral dependent 
upon receiving updated appraisals in  it was noted that the appraised values were significantly less than previous appraisals  or even listed sales prices 
real estate values are depressed due to lack of growth in the market and an abundance of available properties 
the bank s recognition of continuing softness in overall economic conditions and deterioration of underlying collateral securing lending relationships resulted in an ongoing credit review process during the year 
this process led to downgraded internal risk ratings on many existing credits  and subsequently raised required reserve levels 
loans classified as substandard or doubtful have increased to  as of december   compared to  million at december  of which  or of the increase was in the last quarter of 
table of contents the continued economic pressures on customers and valuations on underlying collateral resulted in management increasing its qualitative reserve allocations on its loan portfolios to reflect these conditions 
in addition  the  in net charge offs experienced in resulted in increased quantitative reserve allocations to specific loan portfolios 
as a result of events that occurred subsequent to december  but prior to the issuance of the financial statements an additional  provision for loan losses was recognized 
these events included the negotiating of the sale of notes receivable of several classified assets to a third party  an agreement with a borrower to pay off loan balances at a discount to its carrying balance  and learning additional information which resulted in two troubled debt restructurings impairment reserves being calculated on a collateral dependent basis  rather than discounted cash flows 
in each case  an evaluation was completed and it was determined it was appropriate to adjust the reserve balance to reflect the net realizable value of the loans  and the additional provision was warranted

these business lines have been able to capitalize on favorable market conditions  which include the company continues to see an increase in its deposit accounts and other customer related service fees which totaled  for the year ended december   a increase over s results 
the slight increase was primarily through an increase in the number of accounts and interchange fees on mastermoney debit cards 
the company has experienced a decline in overdraft charges  as consumers are spending less  and less likely to overdraw their accounts 
consumer habits continued to change and the popularity of the reward checking product increased 
this product requires a minimum number of debit card transactions to qualify for the highest interest rate and the accordance of certain account and transaction related fees  resulting in an increase in non interest income when minimums are not met 

table of contents other service charges  commissions and fees of  for the year ended december   declined  or  from the same period in the primary reason for the decline is due to ancillary loan fees being down  which include late fees  letter of credit fees  and prepayment fees 
this trend downward is consistent with the company s slowing down of its loan growth and the increased level of loans moved to nonaccrual status 
trust department and brokerage income increased  or  to  for the twelve months ended december  compared to as a result of increases in trust and brokerage activity as the stock market continued its recovery  and additional trust and brokerage assets under management  which increased from  at december  to  at december  the continued decline in mortgage interest rates has led to an increase in new mortgage loan applications as well as refinancing activities 
given these low interest rates  the company generally sells its year conforming loans to investors 
the increase in activity has resulted in increases in mortgage banking revenues to  for the twelve months ended december  compared to  in life insurance earnings of  for the year ended december  is  or less than in the decline is the result of  of life insurance proceeds received upon the death of two directors in  with no similar proceeds received in offsetting this decline was additional income earned by the company on life insurance as it maintained higher levels of average investment balances in than in in the third quarter of  the company sold its merchant service business  which resulted in a gain of approximately  and is included in merchant processing revenue 
the recognition of this gain is the primary reason for the increase in merchant processing revenue for the year ended december  compared to the same period in due to the sale of this line of business  the company will generate only referral revenues in the future 
included in other income for the twelve months ended december  was the gain on the sale of two fixed for prime floating rate swaps which totaled  which is consistent with the  earned in upon the sale of one interest rate swap 
in connection with the company s asset liability management  it was determined these swaps would be settled as the gain represented much of the interest that would be earned over the remaining life of the swaps  and protect earnings in the event rates would rise 
the company continued to harvest gains on securities available for sale when it was strategically determined that the gains afforded on certain securities was more beneficial than the interest rate earned 
additionally  asset liability management as well as maintaining capital levels factored into the decision to take security gains 
accordingly  gains on securities were  for the year ended december  compared to  in the company continues to advertise and market itself in order for consumers to recognize the broad range of financial services and products the company has to offer  and to increase its brand recognition

excluding the nonrecurring goodwill impairment charge of  noninterest expenses would have totaled  an increase of over s results 
the following contributed to the net increase in other expenses 
salaries and employee benefits decreased  from  for the year ended december  to  for the decrease was primarily attributable to the reduction in employee benefit accruals based on the company s performance  including discretionary executive bonuses  profit sharing accruals and stock compensation awards 
offsetting the reduction in these accruals was a growth in the number of full time equivalents from at december  to at december  fdic insurance totaled  for the twelve months ended december   an increase of  or  over the increase is the result of additional deposits that the bank has been able to generate in  combined with higher assessment rates in than those charged in the company expects that fdic insurance will continue to increase in as it anticipates higher assessment rates in the coming year 
professional services totaled  for the year ended december   compared to  in  an increase of  the increase in expenses can be attributed to increased utilization of professional services  and new services outsourced to third party providers 
professional services include expenses associated with third party loan review assistance  legal and accounting costs 
due to the increased complexity of the company and the issues it faces  we anticipate that outside parties will continue to be consulted in collection and real estate owned expenses increased approximately  for the year ended december  and totaled  compared to  for these expenses have increased as a result of the increase in classified assets with corrective action and work out plans  in order to mitigate the company s risk of loss 

table of contents the largest increase was in goodwill impairment and intangible asset amortization  which totaled  for the year ended december   an increase of  compared to the increase was attributable to a goodwill impairment charge of  slightly offset by lower amortization of other intangibles 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a non cash impairment charge in connection with its annual evaluation of goodwill 
the impairment charge resulted from several factors  the most prominent being decreases in trading multiples of the company s common stock  overall valuations of comparable organizations  a deterioration in asset quality of the commercial real estate portfolio  and the negative impact of deteriorating asset quality on expected cash flows 
as a result of these negative indicators and subsequent analysis  the company s entire goodwill balance was written off at december  other operating expenses increased  for the year ended december   from  in to  in included in other operating expenses is a provision for off balance sheet reserves totaling  in with no corresponding charge in in light of the downturn in real estate conditions  a reserve was established in for loan commitments  principally on construction loans  that have not yet been funded 
in addition  the company experienced its first losses on loans sold with recourse in the secondary market under the fhlb of chicago s mpf program 
each loan that is sold under the program is credit enhanced 
for the year ended december   the company foreclosed or is in the process of foreclosing on loans sold under the mpf program  with a resulting charge of  included in other operating expenses representing an estimate of the company s losses under its recourse exposures 
the remainder of the increase in noninterest expenses is primarily the result of the growth experienced by the company 
in order to better understand how noninterest expenses increased in relation to related increases in revenue  operating expense levels are often measured in the financial services industry by the efficiency ratio  which expresses non interest expense as a percentage of tax equivalent net interest income and noninterest income  excluding securities gains  goodwill impairment  and other non recurring items 
despite an increase in noninterest expenses  the efficiency ratio only increased slightly for the year ended december  to  compared to in the same period  due to the growth in revenues the company experienced 
the company expects that the efficiency ratio will increase in future periods as noninterest expenses will continue to increase as it works through its asset quality issues  and revenues will decline due to the number of loans placed on nonaccrual status and maintaining asset levels relatively consistent 
v 
s results noninterest expenses rose from  during the twelve months of to  for  an increase of  or 
the following contributed to the increase in other expenses 
the largest increase was in salaries and employee benefits  which totaled  for the twelve months ended december   an increase of  over s results 
the increase was attributable to the growth in the number of staff  which grew from full time equivalents at december  to at december  the addition of these employees directly contributed to the revenue growth the company experienced  as many were revenue producers 
additional support staff was also required to handle the additional business volume 
additional increases in employee benefits were noted  particularly health and welfare costs  which increased consistent with national trends 
further  the company recorded expense related to its share based compensation for employees of  for the twelve months ended december   compared to  in advertising and bank promotions increased  in compared to the increase was the result of the company continuing to enhance its brand in the markets it serves 
contributions  included in advertising and bank promotions expense  for the year ended december  totaled  
table of contents or  higher than in the increase in expense was a result of commitments to the communities that the bank serves as we continue to build relationships and expand our presence in these market areas 
fdic insurance totaled  for the twelve months ended december   an increase of  or  over the increase was the result of additional deposits that the bank was able to generate in  combined with higher assessments in than in collection and real estate owned expenses increased approximately  from  for the twelve months ended december  to  for the same period in the increase is commensurate with the increase in risk assets discussed in the provision and allowance for loan losses section 
in the third quarter of  the bank incurred additional expenses associated with its investments in low income housing projects 
this resulted in incremental expense of  recorded in the year ended december  over the same period in these charges are included in other operating expenses 
fees associated with the bank s mastermoney card totaled  for the year ended december   an increase of  over s expense 
the increase in expense is consistent with an increase in mastermoney fee income of  these expenses are included in other operating expenses 
the remainder of the increase in noninterest expenses was primarily the result of the growth experienced by the company 
despite an increase in the other expenses  the company was able to improve on its efficiency ratio  which was for the twelve months ended december   compared to in federal income taxes the company recognized an income tax benefit of  for the year ended december   compared to income tax expense of  and  for the years ended december  and in dollar terms  the primary reason for the fluctuation in income tax expense or benefit is due to changes in the levels of pre tax income loss for the period 
a more meaningful comparison is the effective tax rate  a measurement of income tax expense as a percent of pretax income  which was   and for the years ended december   and the company s effective tax rate is less than the federal statutory rate  primarily due to tax exempt loan and security income  life insurance earnings and tax credits associated with low income housing and historic projects  offset by certain non deductible expenses and state income taxes 
in  the effective tax rate was impacted by non tax deductible goodwill impairment  which resulted in little benefit to the company 
the effective tax rate in was pushed down due to  of historic credits that resulted from a senior housing project in our market area 
the company actively seeks tax free investment opportunities  when the yield  on a tax equivalent basis  is favorable compared to taxable investments 
financial condition a substantial amount of time is devoted by management to overseeing the investment of funds in loans and securities and the formulation of policies directed toward the profitability and minimization of risk associated with such investments 

table of contents securities available for sale the company utilizes securities available for sale as a tool for managing interest rate risk  enhancing income through interest and dividend income  to provide liquidity and to provide collateral for certain deposits and borrowings 
as of december   securities available for sale were  a  decrease from the december  balance of  the company has established investment policies and an asset management policy to assist in administering its investment portfolio 
decisions to purchase or sell these securities are based on economic conditions and management s strategy to respond to changes in interest rates  liquidity  securitization of deposits and repurchase agreements and other factors while obtaining the maximum return on the investments 
under generally accepting accounting principles  the company may segregate its investment portfolio into three categories securities held to maturity  trading securities and securities available for sale 
management has classified the full securities portfolio as available for sale 
securities available for sale are to be accounted for at their current market value with unrealized gains and losses on such securities to be excluded from earnings and reported as a net amount in other comprehensive income 
the company s securities available for sale include debt and equity instruments that are subject to varying degrees of credit and market risk 
this risk arises from general market conditions  factors impacting specific industries  as well as corporate news that may impact specific issues 
management continuously monitors its debt securities  including updates of credit ratings  monitoring market  industry and segment news  as well as volatility in market prices 
the company uses various indicators in determining whether a debt security is other than temporarily impaired  including the extent of time the security has been in an unrealized loss position  and the extent of the unrealized loss 
in addition  management assesses whether it is likely the company will have to sell the security prior to recovery  or if it is able to hold the security until the price recovers 
for those debt securities in which management concludes the security is other than temporarily impaired  it will recognize the credit component of an other than temporary impairment in earnings and the remaining portion in other comprehensive income 
given the strong asset quality of the debt security portfolio  management has not had to take an other than temporary impairment charge in for equity securities  when the company has decided to sell an impaired available for sale security and does not expect the fair value of the security to fully recover before the expected time of sale  the security is deemed other than temporarily impaired in the period in which the decision to sell is made 
the company recognizes an impairment loss when the impairment is deemed other than temporary even if a decision to sell has not been made 
the company recorded  and  of other than temporary impairment expense on equity securities for the years ended december   and  respectively

table of contents of securities from these portfolios were kept liquid  and the company has seen an increase in its federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits with banks of  given the current interest rate environment and funding needs of maturing borrowings and deposits  including brokered time deposits discussed further in the deposit section  management has kept the funds liquid in order to meet these obligations

loan portfolio the company offers various products to meet the credit needs of our borrowers  principally consisting of commercial real estate loans  commercial and industrial loans  and retail loans consisting of loans secured by residential properties  and to a lesser extent  installment loans 
no loans are extended to non domestic borrowers or governments 
with certain exceptions  we are permitted under applicable law to make loans to single borrowers including certain related persons and entities in aggregate amounts of up to of the sum of total capital and the allowance for loan losses 
the company s legal lending limit to one borrower was approximately  at december  the company s loan portfolio is broken down into segments to an appropriate level of disaggregation to allow management to monitor the performance by the borrower and to monitor the yield on the portfolio 
in  management incorporated the provisions of asu  disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for loan losses  resulting in the refinement in its portfolio segregation 
consistent with this standard  the segments were further broken down into classes  to allow for differing risk characteristics within a segment 
the risks associated with lending activities differ among the various loan classes  and are subject to the impact of changes in interest rates  market conditions of collateral securing the loans  and general economic conditions 
all of these factors may adversely impact the borrower s ability to repay its loans  and impact the associated collateral 
the company has various types of commercial real estate which have differing levels of credit risk associated with them 
owner occupied commercial real estate loans are generally dependent upon the successful 
table of contents operation of the borrower s business  with the cash flows generated from the business being the primary source of repayment of the loan 
if the business suffers a downturn in sales or profitability  the borrower s ability to repay the loan could be in jeopardy 
non owner occupied and multi family commercial real estate loans present a different credit risk to the company than owner occupied commercial real estate  as the repayment of the loan is dependent upon the borrower s ability to generate a sufficient level of occupancy to produce rental income that exceeds the debt service requirement and operating expenses 
lower occupancy or lease rates may result in a reduction in cash flows  which hinder the ability of the borrower to meet debt service requirements  and may result in lower collateral values 
the company generally recognizes greater risk is inherent in these credit relationships as compared to owner occupied loans mentioned above in its loan pricing 
acquisition and development loans consist of family residential construction and commercial and land development loans 
the risk of loss on these loans is largely dependent on the company s ability to assess the property s value at the completion of the project  which should exceed the property s construction costs 
during the construction phase  a number of factors could potentially negatively impact the collateral value  including cost overruns  delays in completing the project  competition  and real estate market conditions which may change based on the supply of similar properties in the area 
in the event the collateral value at the completion of the project is not sufficient to cover the outstanding loan balance  the company must rely upon other repayment sources  including the guarantors of the project or other collateral securing the loan 
commercial and industrial loans include advances to local and regional businesses for general commercial purposes and include permanent and short term working capital  machinery and equipment financing  and may be either in the form of lines of credit or term loans 
although commercial and industrial loans may be unsecured to our highest rated borrowers  the majority of these loans are secured by the borrower s accounts receivable  inventory and machinery and equipment 
in a majority of these loans  the collateral also includes the business real estate or the business owner s personal real estate or assets 
commercial and industrial loans present credit exposure to the company  as they are more susceptible to risk of loss during a downturn in the economy  as borrowers may have greater difficulty in meeting their debt service requirements and the value of the collateral may decline 
the company attempts to mitigate this risk through its underwriting standards  including evaluating the credit worthiness of the borrower and to the extent available  credit ratings on the business 
additionally  monitoring of the loans through annual renewals and meetings with the borrowers are common 
however  these procedures cannot eliminate the risk of loss associated with commercial and industrial lending 
the company originates loans to its retail customers  including fixed rate and adjustable first lien mortgage loans with the underlying family owner occupied residential property securing the credit 
the company s risk exposure is minimized in these types of loans through the evaluation of the credit worthiness of the borrower  including credit scores and debt to income ratios  and underwriting standards which limits the loan to value ratio to generally no more than upon loan origination  unless the borrower obtains private mortgage insurance 
home equity loans  including term loans and lines of credit  present a slightly higher risk to the company than family first liens  as these loans can be first or second liens on family owner occupied residential property  but can have loan to value ratios of no greater than of the value of the real estate taken as collateral 
the credit worthiness of the borrower is considered including credit scores and debt to income ratios  which generally cannot exceed 
installment and other loans credit risks are mitigated through conservative underwriting standards  including the evaluation of the credit worthiness of the borrower  including credit scores and debt to income ratios  and if secured  the collateral value of the assets 
as these loans can be unsecured or secured by assets  the value of which may depreciate quickly or may fluctuate  they present a greater risk to the company than family residential loans

the following industries meet the concentration criteria defined by the bank s lending policy at december  dollars in thousands balance of total loans of bank s equity land subdivision lessors of residential buildings and dwellings lessors of nonresidential buildings hotels except casinos and motels the growth in the loan portfolio remained relatively flat during  with loans totaling  at december  compared to  at december   after several years of strong growth 
in light of deteriorating asset quality conditions  the company has curbed its balance sheet growth in order to address and enhance credit administration and underwriting processes and procedures 
during the first half of  the company was able to grow its loan portfolio  however  in the second half of the year the portfolio decreased from its high balance on june  of  
table of contents despite flat growth overall  the company was able to increase its total home equity and installment loan balances by from december  to december   the result of focused marketing campaigns through our retail staff and call center 
offsetting the growth in these consumer products was a decline in first lien residential mortgages  which declined  from  at december  to  at december  as a result of asset liability and capital management  the company sold its shorter lived family residential mortgage  generally with maturities of years  which were previously held in its portfolio 
longer termed residential mortgage loans continue to be sold on the secondary market  as they present greater interest rate risk 
as a result of the flat asset growth  the company has experienced declines it is acquisition and development loans  as projects are completed and moved to permanent financing  with a corresponding decrease to other loan categories 
the largest project that was finished was a loan on an approximate million townhouse development in which the construction phase ended and the loan moved to its permanent financing  and is now presented in the commercial category 
as the company s pipeline has been reduced  the construction loan balances are declining as projects are finished

at december  there was approximately  of such loans 

table of contents asset quality risk elements the company s loan portfolios are subject to varying degrees of credit risk 
credit risk is mitigated through conservative underwriting standards  on going credit review  and monitoring asset quality measures 
additionally  loan portfolio diversification  limiting exposure to a single industry or borrower  and requiring collateral also mitigate the company s risk of credit loss 
the company s loan portfolio is principally to borrowers in south central pennsylvania and washington county  maryland 
as the majority of loans are concentrated in this geographic region  a substantial portion of the debtor s ability to honor their obligations may be affected by the level of economic activity in the market area 
nonperforming assets include nonaccrual and restructured loans and foreclosed real estate 
in addition  loans past due days or more and still accruing are also deemed to be a risk asset 
for all loan classes  the accrual of interest income ceases when principal or interest is past due days or more and collateral is inadequate to cover principal and interest or immediately if  in the opinion of management  full collection is unlikely 
interest will continue to accrue on loans past due days or more if the collateral is adequate to cover principal and interest  and the loan is in the process of collection 
interest accrued  but not collected  as of the date of placement on nonaccrual status  is generally reversed and charged against interest income  unless fully collateralized 
subsequent payments received are either applied to the outstanding principal balance or recorded as interest income  depending on management s assessment of the ultimate collectability of principal 
loans are returned to accrual status  for all loan classes  when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current  have performed in accordance with the contractual terms of the note for a reasonable period of time  generally six months  and the ultimate collectability of the total contractual principal and interest is reasonably assured 
past due status is based on contract terms of the loan 
loans  the terms of which are modified  are classified as troubled debt restructurings if a concession was granted  for legal or economic reasons  related to a debtor s financial difficulties 
concessions granted under a troubled debt restructuring typically involve a temporary deferral of scheduled loan payments  an extension of a loan s stated maturity date  temporary reduction in interest rates  or below market rates 
if a modification occurs while the loan is on accruing status  it will continue to accrue interest under the modified terms 
nonaccrual troubled debt restructurings are restored to accrual status if scheduled principal and interest payments  under the modified terms  are current for six months after modification  and the borrower continues to demonstrate its ability to meet the modified terms 
troubled debt restructurings are evaluated individually for impairment if they have been restructured during the most recent calendar year  or if they are not performing according to their modified terms

the largest increase in risk elements was nonaccrual loans  which totaled  at december  compared to  at december   an increase of  all loan segments experienced increases in nonaccrual loans from year end december  to  with commercial acquisition and development and non owned occupied segments experiencing the greatest dollar and percentage increases  reflective of softness in the real estate market and corresponding decline in collateral values 
the increase in nonaccrual loans since december  is the results of loans totaling  being moved to nonaccrual status during the year   of loans being charged off   of loans foreclosed on and transferred to other real estate owned and  of net paydowns 

table of contents restructured loans still accruing totaled  at december  compared to  at december  in the second quarter of  the company early adopted the provisions of asu no 
 a creditor s determination of whether a restructurings is a troubled debt restructuring 
as a result of adopting the amendment in asu no 
 the company reassessed terms and conditions to customers on restructured loans that had been completed 
the company designated certain relationships in which management worked with the borrower and modified terms and conditions  principally extensions of loan maturities  as restructured loans 
despite the company s ability to increase the rate on many of the loans to a floor rate of interest and strengthening of loan quality with additional collateral in certain instances  the loans were designated as restructured as the borrowers were experiencing financial difficulties  and the new rates were below a market rate given the risk of the transaction  which was determined to be a concession to its borrowers that were experiencing financial difficulties 
the company proactively took actions with these borrowers to enable them to repay their loans under revised terms and conditions  which were felt to mitigate loss potential to the bank while allowing the borrowers to work through these softened economic times 
in addition to the restructured loans in accruing status and included in the restructured loan total of  loans with principal balances of  were considered troubled debt restructurings during  which have either defaulted in the past months  or it was anticipated the bank will likely not be able to collect all principal on the loan  and are included in nonaccrual loans in the table above 
in  the company restructured two residential mortgages in order to assist the borrowers who were experiencing financial difficulties 
the restructured loans resulted in concessions that the bank made in interest rates for a short less than twelve months period of the remaining amortization schedule  and resulted in a reduction of the discounted cash flows of the loans  based on the original loans interest rate  of approximately  as a result of the elevated level of nonaccruing loans and other risk elements  the company has increased the number of personnel in its loan workout and credit review departments and outsourced certain credit review responsibilities in order to identify problem loans  mitigate the company s risk of loss  and to reduce its level of nonaccrual and classified loans 
during the second half of  new appraisals were received on many criticized assets along with updated financial statements received on these borrowers 
continued softness in the real estate market coupled with deteriorating financial conditions and global cash flows of the borrowers  reclassifying certain loans to nonaccrual status was determined to be an appropriate course of action 
in addition to monitoring the asset quality ratios noted above  another key metric that is used by the company in its progress of working through its risk assets is the ratio of classified assets to tier capital plus its allowance for loan losses 
as of december   this ratio was  compared to at december  the company s loan workout and credit review departments are conducting meetings with its borrowers and other third parties to determine ways in which it can reduce or eliminate its exposure  or negotiate other terms in order to enhance the loans internal loan review rating 
the increase in risk assets has resulted in the company experiencing an increase in its ratio of total risk assets to total assets during the past five years  including an increase from at december  to at december  increases in risk assets have been experienced by financial institutions both at a national and local level during the past several years  and the company has seen increases as well 
as of december   the company has approximately lending relationships that are included in the nonaccrual loan balance of  of these relationships  have outstanding book balances in excess of  totaling  or of the total nonaccrual balance 
in connection with the determination of the impairment associated with these collateral dependent relationships  partial charge offs totaling  were taken on certain loan balances  and another  of asc impairment reserves were recorded on the balances at december  the partial charge offs resulted from those loans in which recent appraisals were obtained  and the carrying value of the loans exceeded their updated appraised fair values  less costs to dispose 
the asc impairment reserves resulted from those situations in which additional costs to dispose would be required and were reserved for  or in which the estimate of fair value was pending the finalization of the appraisal process 

table of contents the largest relationship that the company has in nonaccrual status at december  is to a real estate developer who also actively leases residential properties and operates trailer parks 
this relationship consists of separate notes with total outstanding book balances of  with different parcels of land or residential structures securing the outstanding loan balances 
recent appraisals on the collateral securing the outstanding notes received during the fourth quarter resulted in the determination that the relationship should be placed in nonaccrual status  as the softening of real estate prices as well as rental prices  and lengthening of absorption periods resulted in it being classified and evaluated as a collateral dependent impaired loan 
at the time the loans were designated as nonaccrual  a partial charge off of approximately of the outstanding loan balance was taken 
the company is activity working with the customer in reducing their outstanding loan balances 
the second largest relationship in nonaccrual status at december  consists of seven notes with an aggregate outstanding book balance of  to commercial real estate operators with multi use properties in their portfolio  including a restaurant  entertainment facilities  condominiums and office space located in the company s southern market area 
in connection with the evaluation of the relationship  and its placement in nonaccrual status  the company took partial charge offs of approximately of the legal balance of the related loans  representing the amount the outstanding loan balances exceeded the fair value of the collateral at the time the impaired loans were evaluated as collateral dependent 
additionally  five notes were fully charged off on this relationship  with balances totaling  it is anticipated that the notes and recorded mortgages securing this relationship will be sold to a third party in the first quarter of  and the company will record a chargeoff of approximately  which is fully reserved at december  another significant nonaccrual loan relationship is one with outstanding loan book balances of  at december   to a real estate developer and builder with multiple subdivisions in the company s southern market area 
the softness in the real estate market has resulted in longer absorption periods of the lots for sale  delays in commencing new phases of the subdivisions  and lower sales prices 
upon receipt of updated appraised values on the collateral  the company moved the relationship to nonaccrual status  and recorded a partial charge off of approximately of the outstanding loan balances 
the borrower has been cooperative in developing an approach to improve cash flows and reduce its outstanding loan exposure 
a fourth relationship with outstanding book loan balances of  at december  is to an individual and related entities engaged in residential real estate development  construction and investment  including storage rental units 
upon receiving updated appraisals in the fourth quarter of on the collateral securing the outstanding loan balances  it was determined that several loans no longer had collateral with value adequately securing them  due to subordinate lien positions and the decline in the fair value of the real estate 
this resulted in  of loans being fully charged off  and partial charge offs on remaining loans of approximately 
the company has been in contact with the borrower  and has expressed its desire to reduce outstanding loan balances 
the company is currently in the process of evaluating its best course of action on this relationship to mitigate its risk of loss 
one additional relationship has note balances in excess of million  with outstanding loan book balances totaling  at december  this relationship is to a wholesaler that supplies inventory to the commercial construction industry 
as a result of the deterioration in real estate conditions  the borrower s business has been negatively impacted  and has resulted in management concluding that they will be unable to continue to service their debt requirements 
the relationship includes financing for a residence in a resort area 
the company obtained updated appraisals in the fourth quarter of  and the fair values were consistent with management s estimates 
due to cross collateralization of the loans  an impairment reserve of approximately  has been established on the relationship 
a specific charge off has not been recorded  as the cross collateralization makes it difficult to determine the loan that should be charged 
management is attempting to work with the borrower in order to mitigate its risk of loss  however  the borrower has introduced legal counsel to protect its interest 

table of contents the company has two large lending relationships with balances totaling  with borrowers who are included as performing troubled debt restructurings at december  the company is currently in the process of negotiating the sale of these notes  or offering incentives for the borrowers to find alternate financing  and has recorded a reserve of  at december   reflecting the anticipated chargeoff that will occur in the first quarter of when the sale and alternate financing are achieved 
the company has an additional relationships with borrowers with loans that are individually evaluated for impairment  and has taken a similar approach to those mentioned above in determining the extent of full or partial charge offs that were required  or asc reserves that may be needed 
the determination of the company s charge offs or impairment reserve determination properly included an evaluation of the outstanding loan balance  and the related collateral securing the credit 
the company believes through partial charge offs taken to date totaling  the combination of the collateral securing the loans and the reserves allocated for these nonaccrual and restructured loans totaling  that it has adequately provided for the potential losses that it may incur on these relationships as of december  however  as additional time passes  additional information may become known that could result in additional reserve allocations  or  alternatively  it may be deemed that the reserve allocations exceed that which is needed 
the company experienced an increase in foreclosed real estate balances at december  of  compared to december  of  as of december   properties are owned by the company  four of which are commercial properties and total  and the remaining eight consisting of residential properties and totaling  for the year ended december   the company recorded a lower of cost or fair value charge of  compared to  for the year ended december  the largest commercial property consists of land with a carrying value of  that was originally purchased by the company for future expansion purposes 
during  it was determined this property was no longer in the company s strategic plans  and as such  the company re designated the property as held for sale 
at the time of transfer  the property was written down by approximately  the largest residential property has a carrying value of  at december  due to the unique nature of the property  the company recently lowered the sales price and recorded a charge of  to have the property carried at fair value  less costs to dispose 
the remaining properties have carrying values less than  and are also carried at the lower of cost or fair value  less costs to dispose 
as of december   the company believes the value of foreclosed assets represents their fair values  but if the real estate market continues to remain soft  additional charges may be needed 
additionally  as the company works through some of its problem loans  management anticipates that the foreclosed real estate balances may grow 
credit risk management allowance for loan losses during  the company s charge offs have increased significantly  reflective of sluggish economic and real estate conditions 
the company maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level believed adequate by management to absorb losses inherent in the portfolio 
the allowance is established and maintained through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings 
quarterly  management assesses the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses utilizing a defined methodology  which considers specific credit evaluation of impaired loans as discussed above  past loan loss historical experience  and qualitative factors 
management believes the approach properly addresses the requirements of asc section for loans individually identified as impaired  and asc subtopic for loans collectively evaluated for impairment  and other bank regulatory guidance 
the allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management s periodic review of the collectability of the loans in light of historical experience  the nature and 
table of contents volume of the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
in order to monitor ongoing risk associated with its loan portfolio and specific credits within the segments  management uses an eight point internal grading system 
the first four rating categories  representing the lowest risk to the bank  are combined and given a pass rating 
the special mention category includes loans that have potential weaknesses that may  if not monitored or corrected  weaken the asset or inadequately protect the bank s position at some future date 
these assets pose elevated risk  but their weakness does not yet justify a more severe  or criticized rating 
management generally follows regulatory definitions in assigning criticized ratings to loans  including substandard  doubtful or loss 
substandard loans are classified as they have a well defined weakness  or weaknesses that jeopardize liquidation of the debt 
these loans are characterized by the distinct possibility that the bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
substandard loans include loans that management has determined not to be impaired  as well as loans considered to be impaired 
a doubtful loan has a high probability of total or substantial loss  but because of specific pending events that may strengthen the asset  its classification of loss is deferred 
loss assets are considered uncollectible  as the underlying borrowers are often in bankruptcy  have suspended debt repayments  or ceased business operations 
once a loan is classified as loss  there is little prospect of collecting the loan s principal or interest and it is generally written off 
the bank has a loan review policy and program which is designed to reduce and control risk in the lending function 
the credit administration committee  comprised of members of the board  is charged with the overall credit quality and risk exposure of the company s loan portfolio 
this includes the monitoring of the lending activities of all bank personnel with respect to underwriting and processing new loans and the timely follow up and corrective action for loans showing signs of deterioration in quality 
the loan review program provides the bank with an internal through an outsourced third party beginning in  independent review of the bank s loan portfolio on an ongoing basis 
generally  consumer and residential mortgage loans are included in the pass categories unless a specific action  such as extended delinquencies  bankruptcy  repossession or death of the borrower occurs  which heightens awareness as to a possible credit event 
loan reviews are completed annually on all commercial relationships with a committed loan balance in excess of  loan review documentation is submitted to the credit administration committee quarterly with a formal review and rating as presented by independent loan review personnel 
in addition  all relationships rated substandard  doubtful or loss are reviewed by the credit administration committee on a quarterly basis  with reaffirmation of the rating as recommended by the bank s problem loan committee or loan review staff 
in addition to the policy and procedure guidelines noted above  the company expanded its review coverage during the last three quarters of in light of softness in overall economic conditions and deterioration of underlying collateral securing lending relationships 
as a result  all commercial real estate  construction and development loans  and commercial loans in excess of  representing over coverage of these portfolios  have been reviewed

table of contents classified loans may also be evaluated for impairment 
for commercial real estate  acquisition and development and commercial and industrial loans  a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the bank will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status  collateral value  and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due 
loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired 
generally  loans that are more than days past due are assigned a substandard rating 
management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case by case basis  taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower  including the length of the delay  the reasons for the delay  the borrower s prior payment record  and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed 
nonaccrual loans in the commercial and commercial real estate portfolios are  by definition  deemed to be impaired 
impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for commercial  construction and restructured loans by either the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s obtainable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
a loan is collateral dependent if the repayment of the loan is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral 
for loans that are deemed to be impaired for extended periods of time  periodic updates on fair values are obtained  which may include updated appraisals 
the updated fair values will be incorporated into the impairment analysis as of the next reporting period 
in the event an updated appraisal that requires a higher impairment reserve is received after a reporting period  but prior to the issuance of the financial statements  an evaluation is made as to the significance of the difference and whether the amounts need to be reflected in the financial statements not yet issued 
loan charge offs  which may include  from time to time  a partial charge off  are taken on an impaired loan that is collateral dependent if the loan s carrying balance exceeds its collateral s appraised value  the loan has been identified as uncollectible  and it is deemed to be a confirmed loss 
typically  impaired loans with a charge off or partial charge off will continue to be considered impaired  unless the note is split into two  and management expects the performing note to continue to perform and is adequately secured 
the second  or non performing note  would be charged off 
as of the periods presented  the company has no loans to borrowers that resulted from splitting impaired loans into multiple notes 
generally  an impaired loan with a partial charge off will continue to have an impairment reserve on it after the partial charge off  if factors warrant 
as of december  and december   nearly all of the company s impaired loans extent of impairment was measured based on the estimated fair value of the collateral securing the credit  except for troubled debt restructurings 
by definition  troubled debt restructurings are considered impaired 
all restructured loans impairment was determined based on discounted cash flows for those loans classified as troubled debt restructurings but are accruing interest 
for real estate loans  collateral generally consists of commercial real estate  but in the case of commercial and industrial loans  it would also consist of accounts receivable  inventory  equipment or other business assets 
commercial and industrial loans may also have real estate collateral 
at the time a real estate secured loan is deemed impaired  management determines whether an updated certified appraisal of the real estate is necessary to assist in determining the extent of an impairment reserve  if any 
the decision for requiring an updated appraisal takes into consideration the age of the most recent appraisal  the loan to value ratio based on the original certified appraisal  the company s recent experience and knowledge of market conditions  recent list prices or broker opinions  the condition of the property  and environmental factors 
if market conditions have changed significantly from the date of the most recent appraisal  an updated appraisal will be obtained 
as of october   the company amended its policy  which now requires annual updated appraisals for criticized loans in excess of  the as is value provided in the appraisal is often used as the fair value of the collateral in determining impairment  unless circumstances  such as subsequent improvements  approvals  or other circumstances dictate that another value provided by the appraiser is more appropriate 

table of contents generally  impaired loans secured by real estate were measured at fair value using certified real estate appraisals that had been completed within the last year 
appraised values are further discounted for estimated costs to sell the property and other selling considerations to arrive at the properties fair value 
in those situations in which it is determined an updated appraisal is not required for loans individually evaluated for impairment  fair values are based on one or a combination of the following approaches 
in those situations in which a combination of approaches is considered  the factor that carries the most consideration will be the one management believes is warranted 
the approaches are as follows original appraisal if the original appraisal provides a strong loan to value generally or lower and  after consideration of market conditions and knowledge of the property and area  it is determined by the credit administration staff that there has not been a significant deterioration in the collateral value  the original certified appraised value may be used 
discounts as deemed appropriate for selling costs are factored into the appraised value in arriving at fair value 
discounted cash flows in limited cases  discounted cash flows may be used on projects in which the collateral is liquidated to reduce the borrowings outstanding  and is used to validate collateral values derived from other approaches 
collateral on certain impaired loans is not limited to real estate  and consists of accounts receivable  inventory  equipment or other business assets 
estimated fair values are determined based on borrowers financial statements  inventory ledgers  accounts receivable agings or appraisals from individuals with knowledge in the business 
stated balances are generally discounted for the age of the financial information or the quality of the assets 
in determining fair value  liquidation discounts are applied to this collateral based on existing loan evaluation policies 
the company distinguishes substandard loans on both an impaired and non impaired basis  as it places less emphasis on a loan s classification  and increased reliance on whether the loan was performing in accordance with the contractual terms 
substandard classification does not automatically meet the definition of impaired 
a substandard credit is one that is inadequately protected by current sound worth  paying capacity of the obligor or the collateral pledged  if any 
extensions of credit so classified have well defined weaknesses which may jeopardize the liquidation of the debt 
they are characterized by the distinct possibility that the bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
loss potential  while existing in the aggregate amount of substandard credits  does not have to exist in individual extensions of credit classified substandard 
as a result  the company revised its methodology in its evaluation of certain accruing commercial real estate  acquisition and development and commercial and industrial loans rated substandard collectively for impairment as opposed to evaluating these loans individually for impairment 
although we believe these loans have well defined weaknesses and meet the definition of substandard  they are generally performing and management has concluded that it is likely it will be able to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
larger groups of smaller balance homogenous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment 
generally  the bank does not separately identify individual consumer and residential loans for impairment disclosures  unless such loans are the subject of a restructuring agreement due to financial difficulties of the borrower 

table of contents the following summarizes impaired loans by class  segregated by those for which a specific allowance was required and those for which a specific allowance was not required as of december impaired loans with a specific allowance impaired loans with no specific allowance dollars in thousands recorded investment book balance unpaid principal balance legal balance related allowance recorded investment book balance unpaid principal balance legal balance december  commercial real estate owner occupied non owner occupied multi family acquisition and development family residential construction commercial and land development commercial and industrial residential mortgage first lien home equity term december  commercial real estate owner occupied non owner occupied multi family commercial and industrial residential mortgage first lien home equity term the difference between the recorded investment book balance and the unpaid principal balance legal balance generally results from partial charge offs taken on loans and payments applied entirely to principal on those loans placed on nonaccrual status

generally  management feels that substandard loans that are currently performing and not considered impaired  result in some doubt as to the borrower s ability to continue to perform under the terms of the loan  and represent potential problem loans 
additionally  the special mention classification is intended to be a temporary classification  and is reflective of loans that have potential weaknesses that may  if not monitored or corrected  weaken the asset or inadequately protect the bank s position at some future date 
special mention loans represent an elevated risk  but their weakness does not yet justify a more severe  or classified rating 
these loans require follow up by lenders on the information that may cause the potential weakness  and once resolved  the loan classification may be downgraded to substandard  or alternatively  could be upgraded to pass 
as a result  these loans may become potential problem loans if conditions worsen and they are subsequently downgraded 

table of contents management further monitors the performance and credit quality of the loan portfolio by analyzing the length of time a portfolio is past due  by aggregating loans based on its delinquencies 
the following table presents the classes of loan portfolio summarized by aging categories of performing loans and nonaccrual loans as of december days past due dollars in thousands current still accruing total past due still accruing non accrual total loans december  commercial real estate owner occupied non owner occupied multi family acquisition and development family residential construction commercial and land development commercial and industrial residential mortgage first lien home equity term home equity lines of credit installment and other loans december  commercial real estate owner occupied non owner occupied multi family acquisition and development family residential construction commercial and land development commercial and industrial residential mortgage first lien home equity term home equity lines of credit installment and other loans during the fourth quarter of  the company took a more conservative position on loans days past due still accruing  and generally now will include them as nonaccrual loans unless the loan principal  in full  is in the process of collection  which is generally defined as days 
as a result of this more conservative approach in light of deteriorating asset quality  there are no loans in the days past due still accruing category at december  
table of contents for each loan class presented above  general allowances are provided for loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment  which is based on quantitative factors  principally historical loss trends for the respective loan class  adjusted for qualitative factors 
as of december   the historical loss factor was based on average charge offs for the last quarters eg january  december   whereas prior to december   the historical loss factor was based on an equally weighted rolling quarters 
as of december   for loans rated special mention and substandard not deemed impaired  a weighted average rolling quarters average charge off percentage on the related graded loan type  with a two third weight to the most recent four quarters  and a one third weight for the furthest four quarters was utilized 
for non rated loans evaluated collectively for impairment  the charge off factor for the last quarters is factored into the reserve allocation 
additional reserve allocations of approximately  resulted due to the change to the most recent quarter history 
effective december   the historical loss factor was based on average charge offs for the last quarters and applied to the entire pool of loans  excluding those loans evaluated for impairment under asc in addition  an additional adjustment to the historical loss factors is made to account for delinquency and other potential risk not elsewhere defined within the allowance for loan and lease loss methodology 
the refinement to the methodology was made as management determined that the most recent eight quarters loss history as adjusted based on other portfolio analysis and applied to an entire pool of loans is a better reflection of the losses inherent on non impaired loans within the portfolio at december  in making this determination  management considered current economic and real estate conditions  trends in historical charge off percentages at the company as well as peers  and feedback from regulators 
in addition to the quantitative analysis  additional reserves are allocated on loans collectively evaluated for impairment based on additional qualitative factors 
the qualitative factors used by management to adjust the historical loss percentage to the anticipated loss allocation  which range from basis points per factor  include nature and volume of loans loan growth in the current and subsequent quarters based on the bank s targeted growth and strategic plan  coupled with the types of loans booked based on risk management and credit culture  and number of exceptions to loan policy  supervisory loan to value exceptions  etc 
concentrations of credit and changes within credit concentrations factors considered including the bank s overall portfolio makeup and management s evaluation relating to concentration risk management and the inherent risk associated with the concentrations identified 
experience  ability and depth of management lending staff factors considered include the years of experience of senior and middle management and the lending and loan review staff and turnover of the staff 
other external factors economic  legal  competition  regulatory etc 
ratios and factors considered include trends in the consumer price index cpi  unemployment rates  housing price index  housing statistics compared to the prior year  bankruptcy rates  regulatory and legal environment risks and competition

net charge offs increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december   with the majority of the charge offs coming in the commercial and industrial  commercial real estate and commercial and land development loan portfolios 
the provision for loan losses has increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the same period in  an increase of  in  the provision for loan losses increased  from that expensed in  which totaled the increases that the company has experienced in its provision for loan losses have partially resulted from the growth it has experienced in its loan portfolio 
in addition  the increase in the provision for loan losses for the periods presented can be attributed to declining asset quality and higher charge offs during this time period 
increases in non performing assets and charge offs have been an industry wide trend both at the national and local levels 
see further discussion in the provision for loan losses section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

table of contents the allowance for loan losses allocations presented above represent the reserve allocations on loan balances outstanding at december in addition to the reserve allocations on impaired loans noted above  approximately loans  with outstanding general ledger principal balances of  have had partial charge offs to the allowance for loan losses recorded during the year totaling  as updated appraisals were received on collateral dependent loans  partial charge offs were taken to the extent the loans principal balance exceeded its fair value 
management believes the allocation of the allowance for loan losses between the various loan segments adequately reflects the inherent risk in each portfolio  and is based on the methodology previously discussed 
as previously noted  in and management re evaluated and made certain modifications to its methodology in establishing a reserve to better account for risks inherent in the different segments of the portfolio  particularly in light of increased charge offs  with noticeable differences between the different loan segments 
management believes these periodic enhancements to the allowance for loan losses methodology improves the accuracy of quantifying losses presently inherent in the portfolio  and does not impact the trends or comparability of the periods presented above 
management charges actual loan losses to the reserve and bases the provision for loan losses on the overall analysis taking the methodology into account 
the largest component of the reserve for the last two years has been allocated to the commercial and industrial portfolio 
this reflects the inherent greater risk associated with this portfolio  as evidenced by the greater amounts of net charge offs within the portfolio 
further  as noted in the risk elements discussion  the amount of commercial and industrial loans on nonaccrual status has increased from  at december  to  at december   and the amount of classified commercial and industrial loans increased from  at december  to  at december  a second reserve allocation with a large increase during was in the commercial and land development segment  which increased from  at december  to  at december   for an increase of  the increase in this segment is reflective of continuing softening of real estate  which has led to slower absorption rates of projects  lower sale prices  or projects being temporarily suspended until the market demonstrates signs of recovery 
this resulted in an increase in delinquencies  loans classified  and charge offs during the year 
current real estate conditions have led to an increase in commercial acquisition and land development loans in nonaccrual status  to a total of  at december  compared to  at december  to a lesser extent  real estate conditions impacted the reserve allocation on the family residential construction loans  which increased from  at december  to  at december  the non owner occupied commercial real estate loan segment experienced an increase in its nonaccrual loans from  at december  to  at december  the increase in nonaccrual loans combined with the higher charge offs as a percentage of loans outstanding  resulted in an increase in the reserve allocation on this portfolio of  from  at december  to  at december  as a result of declines in charge offs in the residential and installment consumer loan portfolios  the allowance for loan losses allocated to these portfolios declined approximately  from  at december  to  at december  the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses reflects estimated inherent losses within the portfolio that have not been detected 
this reserve results due to risk of error in the specific and general reserve allocation  other potential exposure in the loan portfolio  variances in management s assessment of national and local economic conditions and other factors management believes appropriate at the time 
the unallocated portion of the allowance has increased in from  at december  to  at december  despite the increase  the unallocated portion of the reserve represents of the entire amount  compared to at december  
table of contents while management believes the company s allowance for loan losses is adequate based on information currently available  future adjustments to the reserve and enhancements to the methodology may be necessary due to changes in economic conditions  regulatory guidance  or management s assumptions as to future delinquencies or loss rates 
deposit products on an average daily basis  total deposits in grew or  over  which continued the trend from  in which average daily balance increased 
each category of time deposits experienced growth on an average daily basis in compared to the two categories that experienced the most significant growth were interest bearing demand deposits  which grew  or  and time deposits  which grew by  or on an average daily balance basis 
given current economic times and market conditions  it has been noted that consumers are saving more 
this fact combined with our strong capital position  strong focus on our customer needs and service  and competitive pricing has allowed the company to attract more demand deposits  including checking and money market products 
in the last half of  the company has experienced growth in its interest bearing demand deposits  as state and municipal subdivisions that had previously elected to be in the company s repurchase agreement product  migrated to an interest bearing demand deposit  secured by investment securities 
the company has maintained a favorable idc financial publishing  inc idc rating  an independent bank safety rating which uses unique rankings of financial ratios to determine the quality ratings of financial institutions  allowing it to attract larger types of deposits  including time deposits  those in excess of  and brokered deposits 
as noted above  the bank s idc rating has led to an opportunity to obtain this relatively cheap funding source 
the company recognizes that brokered funds result in greater volatility as a funding source  but given the current interest rate environment and the steepness of the interest rate curve  elected to use these funds and earn a spread on them to increase net interest as previously discussed 
given the increased volatility in brokered deposits  the company invested a large portion of these amounts in mortgage backed securities  which provide a steady stream of cash flows and are used to meet the maturity needs of time deposits and brokered deposits 
this strategy was utilized  and towards the end of and the first half of  the company had built up its brokered deposit balances  and used the funds for loan growth  or mortgage backed securities 
the average balance of brokered time deposits increased from  for the year ended to  in  and are included in time deposits above 
management continually evaluates its utilization of brokered deposits  and considers the interest rate curve and regulatory views on non core funding sources 
beginning in the third quarter of  the company began to allow its brokered time deposits to run off  without replacement  resulting in a decline in the balance since december  brokered time deposits of  at december  declined from the december  balance of  brokered and other time deposit balances will be less emphasized in the future given the uncertainty of the regulators views on this non core funding source 
despite the increase in year over year deposits from  at december  to  at december   or a increase  it is less than the increase in the average balance for the year  as these brokered and other time deposits were allowed to run off in the latter half of the year

the largest component of short term borrowings include securities sold under agreements to repurchase with deposit customers  in which the customer sweeps a portion of its deposit balance into a repurchase agreement  which is a secured borrowing as a pool of securities are pledged against the balances

table of contents capital adequacy and regulatory matters the management of capital in a regulated financial services industry must properly balance return on equity to its stockholders while maintaining sufficient levels of capital and related risk based regulatory capital ratios to satisfy statutory regulatory requirements 
the company s capital management strategies have been developed to provide attractive rates of returns to its shareholders  while maintaining a well capitalized position of regulatory strength 
total shareholders equity decreased  from  at december  to  at december  historically  earnings retention  defined as net income less dividends declared  has served as a primary source of capital to the company and has been accomplished with a dividend payout ratio of less than over the period of in however  the net loss of  for the year combined with cash dividends paid of  were the primary reasons for the decline in shareholders equity  partially offset by an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income of  and stock issued through stock incentive and dividend reinvestment plans of  the company on a consolidated basis and the bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on the company s and bank s financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the company and the bank must meet specific guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
prompt corrective action provisions are not applicable to financial holding companies 
in the determination of tier and total risk based capital  generally accumulated other comprehensive income loss is excluded from capital  as are intangible assets  a portion of mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets that is dependent on future taxable income greater than one year from the reporting date 
as of december   of the company s deferred tax asset has been disallowed for tier or total risk based capital 
in light of the company s operating performance  which has resulted in a significant increase in the net deferred tax asset and reduction in taxable income  the company anticipates that in a higher portion of the deferred tax asset will be disallowed for tier and total capital risk based capital purposes  as the taxable income in the two year carry back period will be reduced 
to the extent the deferred tax asset must be deducted from regulatory capital  it will result in lower regulatory capital ratios 
the allowance for credit losses  including the allowance for loan losses and reserve for off balance sheet credit commitments  is included as tier capital to the extent it does not exceeds of risk weighted assets 
the amount that exceeds of risk weighted assets  is disallowed as tier capital  but also reduces the company s risk weighted assets 
as of december  and   and  of the allowance for credit losses was excluded from tier capital

table of contents liquidity  rate sensitivity and interest rate risk analysis the primary function of asset liability management is to assure adequate liquidity and sensitivity to changing interest rates 
liquidity management involves the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of customers who may be either depositors wanting to withdraw funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs 
our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows  loan repayments  maturities and sales of investment securities and borrowings from the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
we regularly adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of expected loan demand  expected deposit flows  yields available on interest earning deposits and securities and the objectives of our asset liability management policy 
at december   we had  in loan commitments outstanding  which included  in undisbursed loans   in unused home equity lines of credit and  in commercial lines of credit  and  in standby letters of credit 
certificates of deposit due within one year of december  totaled  or of certificates of deposit 
the large percentage of certificates of deposit that mature within one year reflects customers hesitancy to invest their funds for long periods in the current low interest rate environment 
if these maturing deposits do not remain with us  we will be required to seek other sources of funds  including other certificates of deposit and lines of credit 
depending on market conditions  we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on the certificates of deposit due on or before december  we believe  however  based on past experience that a significant portion of our certificates of deposit will remain with us 
we have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered 
our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents and interest bearing deposits 
the levels of these assets depend on our operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled  and interest bearing deposits with banks totaled  securities classified as available for sale provide additional sources of liquidity  totaled  at december  in addition  at december   we had the ability to borrow a total of approximately  from the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh fhlb  of which we had  in advances and  in letters of credit 
on that date  we had no overnight advances outstanding 
the company s ability to borrow from the fhlb is dependent on having sufficient qualifying collateral  generally consisting of mortgage loans 
the fhlb may require the company to deliver its collateral to them  in the event asset quality continues to deteriorate and the company s earnings performance does not improve 
the company is a separate legal entity from the bank and must provide for its own liquidity 
in addition to its operating expenses  the company is responsible for paying any dividends declared to its shareholders 
the company also has repurchased shares of its common stock 
the company s primary source of income is dividends received from the bank 
for restrictions on the bank s ability to dividend funds to the company  see note  restrictions on dividends  loans and advances  to the consolidated financial statements included in item interest rate sensitivity management requires the maintenance of an appropriate balance between interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
interest bearing assets and liabilities that are maturing or repricing should be adequately balanced to avoid fluctuating net interest margins and to enhance consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing interest rates 
the company has consistently followed a strategy of pricing assets and liabilities according to prevailing market rates while largely matching maturities  within the guidelines of sound marketing and competitive 
table of contents practices 
the goal is to maintain a predominantly matched position with very few planned mismatches 
rate spreads will be sacrificed at times in order to enable the overall rate sensitivity position to stay within the guidelines called for by asset liability management policy 
rate sensitivity is measured by monthly gap analyses  quarterly rate shocks  and periodic simulation 
investment and pricing decisions are made using both liquidity and sensitivity analyses as tools

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is defined as the exposure to interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk  and other relevant market rate or price risks 
for domestic banks  the majority of market risk is related to interest rate risk 
interest rate sensitivity management requires the maintenance of an appropriate balance between interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
interest bearing assets and liabilities that are maturing or repricing should be adequately balanced to avoid fluctuating net interest margins and to enhance consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing interest rates 
the company has consistently followed a strategy of pricing assets and liabilities according to prevailing market rates while largely matching maturities  within the guidelines of sound marketing and competitive practices 
interest earning assets are substantially made up of loans and securities 
loans are priced by management with current market rates as guidelines while achieving a positive interest rate spread and limiting credit risk 
a significant part of the loan portfolio is made up of variable rate loans and loans that will become variable after a fixed term and will reprice as market rates move 
securities are purchased using liquidity and maturity terms as guidelines to obtain a more matched position 
the deposit base is a mix of transaction accounts and time deposits 
many of the interest bearing transaction accounts have discretionary pricing so great flexibility exists for deposit side price adjustments 
time deposits have set maturities as do short term and long term borrowings 
although deposit product cycles and growth are driven by the preferences of our customers  borrowings are structured with specific terms that  when aggregated with the terms for deposits and matched with interest earning assets  mitigate our exposure to interest rate sensitivity 
rate sensitivity is measured by monthly gap analysis  quarterly rate shocks  and periodic simulation 
the schedule that follows reflects the degree to which the company can adjust its various portfolios to meet interest rate changes 
additionally  the bank is a federal home loan bank fhlb member  and standard credit arrangements available to fhlb members provide increased liquidity

table of contents the following gap summary demonstrates the shift in risk sensitive assets to risk sensitive liabilities rsa rsl cumulative position since december  within months within months within months within months december  march  june  september  december  at december   the twelve month cumulative gap was a positive  and the rsa rsl cumulative ratio was which has increased from a negative position  or  since december  the company has been able to significantly reduce its liability sensitivity position throughout  and is now positioned as asset sensitive for each time period 
the company has been able to become more asset sensitive partially through the sale of its  notional amount in interest rate swaps 
these swaps converted variable rate earnings to fixed  and the settlement was done in an effort to increase our asset sensitivity in the event of rising rates 
in addition  the company has maintained its liquidity in interest bearing deposits in banks  included in the other category 
given the low interest rate environment  management feels that rates are more likely to rise than fall  and is the reason the company has allowed its cumulative rsa rsl ratio to increase during  and is asset sensitive 
many of the interest bearing deposits that are variable rate are subject to discretionary pricing so management retains flexibility with those funds which will enhance earnings in a rising rate environment 
the majority of the loan portfolio is tied to prime  but the use of three to seven year rate locks as well as placing rate floors on any new loans helps to maintain the yield in a falling rate environment 
further discussion related to the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is included under the heading of liquidity  rate sensitivity and interest rate risk analysis in item of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
management will closely monitor the fiscal policies of our government and will react to any changes quickly in order to maintain a healthy earning asset interest bearing liability balance
