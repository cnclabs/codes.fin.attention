part i item business overview we design  develop  manufacture and commercialize a broad suite of precision guided therapy tools including intravascular ultrasound  or ivus  and fractional flow reserve  or ffr  products 
we believe that these products enhance the diagnosis and treatment of vascular heart disease by improving the efficiency and efficacy of existing percutaneous interventional  or pci  therapy procedures in the coronary or peripheral arteries 
we are facilitating the adoption of functional pci  in which our ffr technology is used to determine whether or not a stent is necessary  and ivus is used to guide stent placement and optimization 
we market our products to physicians and technicians who perform pci procedures in hospitals and to other personnel who make purchasing decisions on behalf of hospitals 
our products consist of multi modality consoles which are marketed as stand alone units or as customized units that can be integrated into a variety of hospital based interventional surgical suites called catheterization laboratories  or cath labs 
our consoles have been designed to serve as a multi modality platform for our phased array and rotational ivus catheters  ffr pressure wires  image guided therapy catheters and medtronic s pioneer reentry device 
our ivus products include single procedure disposable phased array and rotational ivus imaging catheters and additional functionality options such as virtual histology tissue characterization  or vh  and chromaflo stent apposition analysis 
our ffr offerings can be accessed through our multi modality platforms  and we also 
table of contents provide ffr only consoles 
our ffr disposables are single procedure disposable pressure and flow guide wires used to measure the pressure and flow characteristics of blood around plaque enabling physicians to gauge the plaque s physiological impact on blood flow and pressure 
we are developing additional offerings for integration into the platform  including adenosine free instant wave free ratio ffr  or ifr  forward looking ivus  or fl 
ivus  catheters  ultra high resolution focal acoustic computed tomography catheters and ultra high resolution optical coherence tomography  or oct  systems and catheters 
we derive our revenues from two reporting segments medical and industrial 
our medical segment represents our core business  in which we derive revenues primarily from the sale of our multi modality and ffr consoles and our ivus and ffr single use disposables 
our industrial segment derives revenues related to the sales of micro optical spectrometers and optical channel monitors by axsun technologies  inc  or axsun  our wholly owned subsidiary  to telecommunication and industrial companies 
we continue building direct sales capabilities in the us  certain parts of europe  south africa  and japan and have numerous distributor relationships in other geographies 
during the year ended december   we generated worldwide revenues of million  which is composed of million from our medical segment and million from our industrial segment  and had operating income of million 
our total assets as of december  were million 
our revenue  operating income and total assets and other financial results for the last three fiscal years are described in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements sections contained in this annual report 
at december   we had a worldwide installed base of more than  consoles 
we intend to grow and leverage this installed base of consoles to drive recurring sales of our single use disposable catheters and guide wires  which accounted for approximately of our medical segment revenues during the year ended december  in  approximately of the company s revenues were generated in the us  approximately were generated in japan  and approximately were generated in europe  the middle east and africa  with the balance of sales occurring in other international markets 
our strategy our strategy is to offer a multi modality platform that seeks to deliver all of the benefits associated with conventional ivus and ffr devices  while providing enhanced functionality and proprietary features that address the limitations associated with conventional forms of these technologies 
we are seeking to make precision guided  functional pci a standard of care and to position the company as a leading provider of precision guided therapy 
furthermore  recent clinical data from studies involving ivus and ffr  as well as updated clinical guidelines elevating the use of these technologies  we believe will help drive market adoption 
in addition  we have a number of new offerings under development that will further leverage our multi modality platform 
factors driving our strategy include accelerating the trend toward less invasive procedures 
our ivus products offer continuous  real time three dimensional imaging  plaque visualization  color coded identification of plaque composition  and automatic drawing of lumen and vessel borders allowing for automatic vessel sizing 
our ffr products offer physicians a simple pressure and flow based method to determine whether stenting or additional pci is required 
this strategy complements our focus on precision guided therapy by providing sophisticated guidance tools that enhance the value of minimally invasive procedures 
enhancing the outcomes of pci procedures 
we believe our products enabled with novel technological enhancements  provide clinically significant information that improves the outcomes of current and increasingly complex pci procedures 
providing documentation for necessity of procedures 
increasingly  hospitals and third party payors are requesting proof of necessity for pcis 
we believe our ivus and ffr technologies can assist clinicians in documenting the clinical necessity of these procedures 
decreasing the number of interventional devices used per procedure and optimizing their usage 
our ffr products offer the opportunity to physiologically assess lesion severity and determine whether stents are needed 
additionally  our ivus products provide intra vascular imaging 
as a result  our 
table of contents ivus and ffr products have the potential to reduce the number of devices deployed by identifying the appropriate lesion for stenting and ensuring that stents are placed and expanded correctly  thereby enhancing patient outcomes and lowering treatment costs 
improving ease of use of ivus and ffr technologies to drive market adoption 
we have designed our console offerings to be always there  always on  and easy to use 
our consoles are easily integrated into an existing or newly constructed cath lab facility 
improving the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease 
we believe our vh ivus products can significantly improve the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease by addressing the limitations of diagnostic angiography  and allowing clinicians to identify patients and lesions at risk for future adverse coronary vascular system events 
enabling new procedures to treat coronary artery disease peripheral artery disease and structural heart disease 
currently  the treatment of a number of vascular and structural heart diseases  including coronary  peripheral and carotid artery disease and atrial fibrillation  is limited by conventional catheter based techniques and angiography 
because our technologies address many of these current limitations  we believe our products provide physicians the potential to diagnose and  optimally  treat these diseases percutaneously  and may address limitations in the treatment of structural heart disease 
our goal is to establish our ivus and ffr products as the standard of care for pci diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and expand the use of ivus and ffr for these procedures 
the key elements of our strategy for achieving this goal are to grow existing ivus and ffr markets globally 
we feel that most pci procedures today  particularly those of a more complex nature  benefit greatly from more precise guidance than angiography alone can provide 
we feel that by making our devices easier to use and enabling faster interpretation of images  investing in thoughtful clinical studies and registries that prove the benefit of our technologies  educating physicians and hospital executives on the clinical need for our products and existing guidelines  training staff on the procedural use of our products  and providing access to all patients through the expansion of our installed base  that we can continue to grow and cultivate the current pci market which represents  on an annual basis  more than three million procedures worldwide 
a growing portfolio of image guided therapy devices  such as our vibe rx vascular imaging balloon  or vibe rx  which combines a semi compliant balloon catheter with on board imaging  is another method to reduce friction and move more angiographic guided procedures to incorporate the precision guidance of our products 
increase market share in existing ivus and ffr markets 
we continue to introduce product enhancements to meet physicians needs for improved visualization  characterization  and ease of use 
we believe these enhancements make our products easier to use than competing products and provide substantially more and better information to improve procedural outcomes  thereby driving greater usage of our ivus and ffr products within the existing pci market 
we believe we are the market leader in the ivus market and intend to implement several strategies to increase our penetration in the ffr market 
first  we have addressed limitations of conventional ivus such as difficulty in use  lack of automation and grayscale imaging by developing technologies and introducing features such as automatic real time drawing of lumen and vessel borders  color coded identification of plaque composition  and automatic vessel sizing 
second  we developed pc based ivus and ffr consoles that can be integrated easily into cath labs  thereby making it easier for physicians to adopt and use our products 
third  we have increased the size of our direct sales force and initiated direct distribution strategies in key geographies 
we have also entered into distribution and marketing agreements with leading cath lab equipment and stent manufacturers 
we intend to grow and leverage our installed base of ivus and ffr consoles to drive recurring sales of our single procedure disposable catheters and guide wires 
expand into new markets and develop clinical applications for and utilization of our technology in new markets 
we plan to leverage our current technology and develop new technology to expand into new markets and increase clinical applications through clinical studies  conducted by us or in 
table of contents collaboration with other companies 
this includes programs for ivus guided therapy products that combine ivus with balloons and potentially other therapeutic devices  micro catheter technologies for use in coronary  peripheral and other vascular applications  fl 
ivus for applications including chronic total occlusions in the coronary and peripheral arteries  and forward looking intra cardiac echo  or fl 
ice  for other structural heart applications  oct light based imaging systems  which we believe can be used in coronary  peripheral and other vascular applications  and unique optical and micro electro mechanical systems technologies in telecommunications  industrial spectroscopy or medical oct applications  including ophthalmology and dentistry 
enhance product capabilities and introduce new products through collaborations or acquisitions 
we have a successful track record of acquiring and licensing technologies and collaborating with third parties to create synergistic product offerings 
for instance  we licensed the vh ivus technology that now forms the core of our ability to determine the composition of plaque from the cleveland clinic foundation 
we also licensed the intellectual property rights allowing us to develop our revolution rotational catheter from koninklijke philips electronics nv in december  we acquired cardiospectra  inc  or cardiospectra  whose core product line  based on innovative oct technology  is expected to complement our existing product offerings 
during  we acquired novelis  inc  or novelis  which was developing fl 
ivus technology 
in we also acquired substantially all of the assets of impact medical technologies  llc  which we used to develop innovative micro catheter technologies  and axsun which is a developer of optical laser and non laser technologies 
in august  we acquired fluid medical  inc  or fluid medical  which is developing advanced catheter based forward looking imaging technology 
the fluid medical technology is complementary to our fl 
ivus technology and is expected to enable us to further develop products that address minimally invasive structural heart procedures  such as our fl 
ice program 
we believe there will be additional opportunities to leverage these capabilities through select technology or company acquisitions as well as collaborations that enhance our capabilities or complement our markets 
our products our multi modality consoles are marketed as stand alone units or units that can be integrated into cath labs 
we offer consoles that combine ivus and ffr technology  which are designed to allow the user to switch seamlessly between each modality 
we also offer systems with either ivus or ffr 
the significantly expanded functionality of our offering enables the networking of patient information  control of ivus and ffr information at both the operating table and in the cath lab control room  as well as the capability for images to be displayed on standard cath lab monitors 
our products include ivus catheters  ffr guide wires  thrombus aspiration devices  and various options that provide additional functionality 
we expect to continue to develop new products and technologies to expand the market adoption of our offering  and also expect our platform will support ivus integrated with other interventional devices in the future 
consoles we design  develop  manufacture and commercialize multi modality consoles that are proprietary  high speed electronic systems that process the signals received from our ivus catheters and wires 
these consoles generate high resolution images that can be displayed on a monitor and can be permanently stored on the system or another medium 
our consoles are mobile  proprietary and high speed electronic systems with different functionalities and sizes designed and manufactured to process the signals received only from our catheters and guide wires 
our ivus market strategy includes offering devices to clinicians that are easy to use  reduce procedure times and provide a higher level of information 
we have a family of consoles including our pc based s and the ivus in vision gold  or ivg 
the s family of consoles  which became our primary console product offering following its full commercial launch in july  is smaller  lighter and less expensive to manufacture than our ivus ivg console  and has enhanced functionality 
the s family includes s we believe this portable and mobile console is the lightest product on the market  and has a simple user interface 

table of contents si this console is made up of components that can be customized to each cath lab s specifications and integrated into virtually any cath lab while retaining the full functionality of the s when the si is integrated into the cath lab  it works seamlessly with the workflow of the cath lab in terms of acquiring and archiving patient images and data 
both platforms support digital ivus  rotational ivus  ffr  vh ivus and chromaflo as well as our planned future offerings 
our ivus products catheters 
our single use disposable catheters operate and interface solely with our family of consoles 
we are the only company that offers both digital and rotational catheters 
we believe this allows us to meet the needs of a greater number of physicians than our competitors 
our ivus catheters vary in their principal uses  frequencies  shaft sizes  shaft lengths  guide wire compatibility and distal tip lengths 
these differences allow for the use of different catheters in various portions of the vascular system 
we launched our latest generation digital catheter  the eagle eye platinum digital ivus catheter  commercially in may during  we expect to introduce an enhanced version of our revolution rotational catheter  which we believe will be the highest frequency catheter on the market and will offer better resolution in the area close to the end of the catheter than competitive rotational catheters 
in addition  we plan to introduce a new peripheral ivus catheter  and a new  short tip version of the eagle eye platinum ivus catheter that will enable clinicians to get closer to a chronic total occlusion 
in addition  during  we initiated development of our focal acoustic computed tomography catheter that is designed to provide a higher level of ultrasound resolution imaging than is available with current ivus ultrasound catheters 
additional functionality 
our ivus products incorporate key features that add valuable clinical functionality addressing a number of the historical limitations of conventional ivus 
we intend to develop additional functionality in the future 
currently  we offer chromaflo 
angiography alone does not always identify malapposed stents because the contrast injection that makes the lumen visible on x ray can flow inside the stent  and in between the stent and vessel wall 
when this occurs  the stent struts are too small to compete with the dark lumen of the x ray  leaving the two dimensional image inconclusive or misleading 
chromaflo stent apposition analysis uses sequential ivus frames to differentiate circulating blood from stationary or anchored tissue 
chromaflo can be particularly important when assessing stent placement as the detailed cross sectional image clearly identifies moving blood inside and outside of the stent lumen  prompting physicians in many cases to expand the stent until all of the blood appears inside of the stent lumen 
chromaflo can also help with the identification of luminal structures such as lumen border  bifurcations  dissections  and thrombus 
vh ivus 
conventional ivus allows the visualization of atherosclerotic plaque 
however  it is limited to a subjective  and therefore qualitative  review of vascular and plaque dimensions and composition 
our vh ivus product allows  for the first time  easy to read and interpret ivus images with color coded identification of plaque composition 
additionally  a key element of the vh ivus product is the capability to provide automatic identification of lumen and vessel borders 
this feature enables automated vessel sizing  which makes it easier and faster to use our ivus products 
finally  our vh ivus functionality offers the potential to determine plaque vulnerability and therefore stratification of risk 
we have developed fully functional devices for each of these technologies and have used them in clinical studies 
in january  the new england journal of medicine published results from our clinical study providing regional observations to study predictors of events in the coronary tree  or prospect  an international multi center study  which demonstrated that vh ivus tissue characterization software enables physicians to more accurately assess the risk of individual blockages than the use of the current standard of care angiographic imaging alone 
the prospect results demonstrated the ability to use vh ivus to identify high risk plaques that could potentially be treated to prevent future events  
table of contents and low risk plaques that may not need intervention 
we are in the process of participating in several additional clinical studies to correlate plaque vulnerability to its clinical significance and risk  and believe that these data will lead to further utilization of vh ivus to triage coronary lesions 
our ffr products our ffr products consist of pressure and flow consoles and single procedure disposable pressure and flow guide wires 
we believe we are the only company that offers a full line of pressure and flow guide wires as well as a guide wire that can measure both pressure and flow 
in addition  our ffr products can be integrated with our s family of multi modality consoles 
in august  we commercially launched primewire prestige  our latest generation pressure guide wire 
we expect to introduce the prestigeplus  the latest innovation to our ffr product line  in the u 
s and europe in in addition  we are working on the development of ifr  which is an ffr technology that does not require the administration of adenosine  used to widen blood vessels prior to the procedure 
as a result  by enabling cardiologists to perform ffr without adenosine  ifr has the potential to widen the patient population that could be diagnosed with ffr  and reduce the costs and time associated with the use of ffr 
we believe that the release and publication of favorable trial data relating to the measurement of ffr in addition to angiography will lead to further adoption of ffr technology by clinicians 
product expansion we currently have a number of products under development that will leverage our existing platform technology and we believe will expand our presence in interventional medicine and related markets 
our product pipeline includes image guided therapies the vibe rx catheter is our first image guided therapy device 
a single vibe rx catheter can quickly access  prepare  and assess challenging lesions 
ivus guidance provides precise  targeted balloon dilatation with immediate confirmation of interventional results 
we began commercial shipments of our vibe rx offering in europe and south africa in december of  and commenced a limited market release of the product in japan during we will initiate a full market release of the product in japan during we are in discussions with regulatory authorities in the us regarding the clinical requirements necessary to file for approval of the device in the us also in  we completed a supply agreement with ev  a covidien company  under which we will supply our proprietary ivus technology for use in ev s plaque excision systems catheters that remove plaque blocking peripheral arteries and interrupting blood flow 
micro and thrombectomy catheters during january  we received k clearance for the valet micro catheter  which can be used to facilitate pci procedures when chronic total occlusions are present 
we plan to initiate a limited market release of the valet micro catheter in the us during the first quarter of the valet is expected to be used as a conduit for the exchange and or support of guidewires in peripheral and coronary vascularizations 
in addition  we expect to introduce the reflow aspiration catheter in early  which is indicated for the removal of fresh  soft emboli and thrombi from vessels in the arterial system 
forward looking imaging fl 
ivus fl 
ice a principal area of focus for us is the development of our forward looking advanced imaging technologies 
these proprietary technologies have potential applications for a number of minimally invasive diagnostic and therapeutic applications in the coronary  peripheral and structural heart vasculature 
our strategy is to integrate these offerings into our s family of consoles and target markets such as chronic total occlusions and other coronary  peripheral and structural heart indications 
we expect to introduce our first fl 
ivus offering outside of the us in the second half of 
table of contents optical coherence tomography oct we are developing our oct products to complement our existing product offerings and further enhance our position as an imaging technology leader in the field of interventional medicine 
our early model oct systems have been used in several clinical settings in europe and south america 
we believe our oct products will be an important addition to our product line  as we expect that it will allow us to expand our reach into clinical situations where extremely high resolution imaging is paramount by providing high quality visualization of stent expansion and apposition 
our goal is to integrate this oct functionality directly into our si integrated imaging suite of products 
our oct system is designed to allow fast  easy imaging of highly detailed structures in the vasculature  including vessel wall defects  intra luminal thrombus and stent struts 
our oct resolution is able to visualize even very thin layers of cells covering drug eluting stent struts at follow up 
however  unlike ivus  oct cannot see through blood and requires contrast injections while imaging 
oct also does not penetrate the vessel wall  so only measurements within the lumen and the first one to two millimeter of the lumen wall are possible 
this means that the user cannot measure the full volume and type of plaque or provide the ability to visualize from vessel wall to vessel wall in the presence of coronary disease 
we believe oct will complement ivus in its ability to see small luminal structures 
this will predominantly be a clinical research tool initially until further clinical data can be developed to understand how oct can be applied to daily pci practice 
clinical program our clinical studies are generally post marketing studies using fda cleared and or ce marked products intended to provide data regarding diagnostic effectiveness and disease treatment outcomes  as well as the potential value of our products in providing therapy in markets and indications such as stent placement and optimization  plaque assessment and therapy guidance in the coronary and carotid arteries 
our significant clinical studies include assessment of dual anti platelet therapy with drug eluting stents adapt des adapt des is a prospective  multi center  registry of up to  consecutive patients with coronary artery disease undergoing stent assisted pci using des without major procedural complications 
the objectives of this trial were to determine the frequency and timing of des thrombosis 
an ivus sub study enrolled patients at sites in the us and europe 
the purpose of the sub study was to determine whether one or more ivus parameters are independent predictors of stent thrombosis 
enrollment was completed in the third quarter of  with approximately  patients enrolled in the main study and more than  patients enrolled in the sub study 
the day clinical data was presented at the transcatheter cardiovascular therapeutics  or tct  conference in november we expect one year follow up clinical data and ivus and vh data will be presented at the american college of cardiology meeting in march vascular evaluation for revascularization defining the indications for coronary therapy a pilot study verdict verdict is a prospective  global  multicenter study to determine the correlation between ffr and vh ivus in patients with intermediate coronary lesions 
the objectives of this study are to establish the correlation between ffr and vh ivus derived parameters  to assess the ability of operators to accurately assess angiographic and ivus data and to examine the contemporary use of ffr and vh ivus by operators in determining whether intermediate coronary lesions should undergo treatment 
enrollment started in september and we expect the trial will continue up to four years  including approximately months for enrollment and three years of clinical follow up 
baseline enrollment is expected to be completed in first quarter of and we expect to present data at the tct meeting 

table of contents fractional flow reserve and intravascular ultrasound relationship study first first was a multi center  prospective registry of patients with intermediate coronary lesions that underwent both vh ivus and ffr interrogation 
this study enrolled patients at sites in the us and europe  who were undergoing a clinically indicated angiogram and who have intermediate coronary lesions 
the primary objective of the study was to evaluate the relationship between angiography  ivus  vh  and ffr measurements 
enrollment in this study started in september and was completed in the third quarter of data from the study was presented at the tct conference 
adensonine vasodilation independent stenosis evaluation advise advise was a pilot study to assess the ability of an investigational product  ifr  to provide a measurement of the severity of a coronary stenosis that is similar to ffr without the need for pharmacologic vasodilation 
the results were presented during the late breaking clinical trial sessions at the tct conference in november ifr was developed by physician scientists at imperial college london in partnership with us 
advise was an international multi center study supported by volcano and studied stenoses in patients to validate the ifr technology 
ifr collected closely with ffr r  p with excellent diagnostic efficiency with receiver operating characteristic area under curve of percent and overall diagnostic accuracy of percent 
we believe these outcomes demonstrate that the removal of adenosine from an ffr procedure would reduce costs and potential patient adverse events  and streamline workflow 
adenosine vasodilation independent stenosis evaluation ii advise ii advise ii will study ifr in a larger number of lesions  as a follow on to advise 
it will be a prospective  multi center study intended to generate data to support global regulatory submissions for the ifr technology 
evaluation of xience prime or xience v versus coronary artery bypass surgery for effectiveness of left main revascularization excel excel is a prospective  unblinded  randomized multi center trial involving approximately  patients with left main coronary artery  orulmca  disease and treatment groups of stenting with xience prime or xience v everolimus eluting coronary stent system versus coronary artery bypass grafting 
further  there will be a universal registry of approximately  patients who have angiographically significant left main disease but are not eligible for the randomized trial 
all patients who are randomized to the pci arm and have ivus performed during the procedure will be included in the ivus substudy 
the purpose of the substudy is to determine how acute ivus results will correlate with outcomes 
there will be up to global sites participating 
enrollment commenced in europe in december and in the u 
s in november enrollment is expected to take approximately two years 
sales  marketing and distribution we sell consoles and disposables through our own direct sales force and distributors

in addition  we have numerous distributor relationships in these and other geographic areas 

table of contents in  we completed our strategy to convert from a third party distribution model in japan to a direct sales model  a process we began in we previously sold our ivus and ffr products in japan primarily through three direct distributors goodman company ltd  or goodman  fukuda denshi co  ltd  or fukuda  and johnson johnson kk  cordis division  or johnson johnson 
in  we terminated our distribution relationship with goodman and implemented a direct sales program to replace that relationship 
in  we entered into an agreement to terminate our distribution agreement with fukuda 
in  we ended our agreement with johnson johnson 
as a result  all of our business in japan is now served by the company s direct sales force 
we currently support our japanese customers through our tokyo based subsidiary  volcano japan co  ltd  or volcano japan 
in europe  we distribute our ivus and ffr products through our subsidiary  volcano europe  bvba  or volcano europe 
we sell our products directly to customers in certain european markets and utilize distributors in other european markets 
we have marketing agreements with leading healthcare company partners or their affiliates  including medtronic  inc  or medtronic  general electric company  siemens ag  philips medical systems nederland bv  and abbott 
these agreements allow us to coordinate our marketing efforts with our strategic partners while still dealing directly with the customer 
at december   our global marketing team was comprised of over individuals  covering product management  corporate communications and programs  clinical support  and education and training 
we devote significant resources to training and educating physicians in the use and benefits of our products 
we also promote our products through medical society meetings attended by interventionists

table of contents our international operations expose us and our representatives  agents  and distributors to risks inherent in operating in foreign jurisdictions  including the risks described in risk factors the risks inherent in our international operations may adversely impact our revenues  results of operations and financial condition 
competition we compete primarily on the basis of our ability to assist in the diagnosis and treatment of vascular diseases safely and effectively  with ease and predictability of product use  adequate third party reimbursement  brand name recognition and cost 
we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors  although there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future or that new products that perform better than those we offer will not be introduced 
we believe that our continued success depends on our ability to innovate and maintain scientifically advanced technology  apply our technology across products and markets  successfully market our products  develop proprietary products  successfully conduct clinical studies that expand our markets  obtain and maintain patent protection for our products  secure and preserve regulatory approvals  achieve manufacturing efficiencies  attract and retain skilled personnel  and successfully add complementary offerings and technology through acquisitions  licensing agreements and strategic partnerships 
our primary imaging competitor globally is boston scientific  inc  or boston scientific  but we also compete with terumo corporation in japan 
in the ffr market  our primary competitor is st 
jude medical  inc  or st 
jude  which acquired radi medical systems ab  or radi  in because of the size of the vascular market opportunities  competitors and potential competitors have dedicated and will continue to dedicate significant resources to aggressively promote their products 
new product developments that could compete with us more effectively are likely because the vascular disease market is characterized by extensive research efforts and technological progress 
for example  oct represents a potentially competitive technology with our ivus technology 
competitors may develop technologies and products that are safer  more effective  easier to use or less expensive than ours 
we have encountered and expect to continue to encounter potential physician customers who  due to existing relationships with our competitors  are committed to or prefer the products offered by these competitors 
through the axsun subsidiary we compete on the basis of leading technology  high quality and the enhanced productivity that our products offer to customers in a variety of industries  including telecommunications  pharmaceutical manufacturing  high speed industrial process control  chemical and petrochemical processing  medical diagnostics  and scientific discovery 
products developed by competitors based on lower performance tunable filter technology could compete on the basis of lower cost 
in addition  customers may build similar functionality directly into their products 
our primary competitors in the telecommunications market include optoplex corporation  aegis lightwave  inc and bayspec  inc 
we expect that competitive pressures may result in price reductions and reduced margins over time for our products 
our products may be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances developed by one or more of our competitors 
additional information regarding the risks associated with our competitive position and environment is described in risk factors risks related to our business and industry 

table of contents intellectual property we believe that in order to maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace  we must develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technologies 
we rely on a combination of patent  trademark  trade secret  copyright and other intellectual property rights and measures to aggressively protect our intellectual property 
we require our employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements in connection with their employment or consulting relationships with us 
we also require our employees and consultants who work on our products to agree to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived during the term of their employment  while using our property or which relate to our business 
despite measures taken to protect our intellectual property  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
in addition  our competitors may independently develop similar technologies 
the medical device industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement 
as the number of entrants into our market increases  the risk of an infringement claim against us grows 
while we attempt to ensure that our products and methods do not infringe other parties patents and proprietary rights  our competitors may assert that our products  and the methods we employ  are covered by patents held by them 
in addition  our competitors may assert that future products and methods we may employ infringe their patents 
if third parties claim that we infringe upon their intellectual property rights  we may incur liabilities and costs and may have to redesign or discontinue selling the affected product 
for example  in july  st 
jude sued us for patent infringement alleging products that have been on the market for more than ten years infringe upon st 
jude s patents

our product development process incorporates teams organized around each of our core technologies  with each team having representatives from research and development  marketing  regulatory  quality  clinical affairs and 
table of contents manufacturing 
our team sets development priorities based on communicated customer needs 
the feedback received from beta testing is incorporated into successive design iterations until a new product is ready for release 
our research and development expenses were million in  million in  and million in these totals include expenses related to research and development  clinical and regulatory affairs 
in addition  in we recorded a million reduction in in process research and development expenses related to the reversal of expenses recognized in the prior year for a development milestone related to the acquisition of the fl 
ivus program from novelis  as we believed we would no longer achieve the milestone 
in we recognized in process research and development expense of million  which included an million milestone payment for our oct project acquired from cardiospectra and the accrual of a million milestone payment related to our fl 
ivus project acquired from novelis 
manufacturing our manufacturing facilities are located in rancho cordova  california  where we produce multi modality consoles  ffr consoles  ivus catheters and ffr guide wires  and billerica  massachusetts  where we produce our optical monitors  laser and non laser light sources  and optical engines used in oct imaging systems as well as micro optical spectrometers and optical channel monitors 
our console manufacturing strategy is to use third party manufacturing partners to produce circuit boards  cpus  and mechanical sub assemblies 
we perform incoming inspection  final assembly and product testing to assure quality control 
our manufacturing strategy for our single procedure disposable products is to use third party manufacturing partners for certain proprietary components used in the final assembly 
we perform incoming inspection on these components  assemble them into finished devices and test the final product to assure quality control 
a portion of the scanner and sensor manufacturing is performed at third party contractors facilities using automated assembly processes and equipment 
we are dependent on these third parties for day to day control and protection of their systems 
we conduct the remaining process operations including final testing on the scanners and sensors at our rancho cordova facility 
we aim to continuously improve our manufacturing processes to reduce costs and improve margins 
we believe that by moving to pc based consoles and improving our manufacturing processes through broad adoption of lean principles  selective use of automation and continuous design enhancements  we will be able to continue to reduce the cost to manufacture our consoles and single procedure disposable products 
we manufacture our products in accordance with fda other required global regulations 
we believe we are in material compliance with the us  european  japanese  and regulations 
the fda and the european union notified body have both inspected our manufacturing facilities during the last months 
the control systems for our optical and laser products are certified under iso we are constructing a new facility in costa rica to increase our manufacturing capacity 
we plan to complete construction in the first quarter of and receive clearance from us and european regulators in the second quarter of at which time we expect to begin commercial manufacturing activities 
we expect to invest a total of approximately million in the completion of this facility and related improvements 
during  we commenced the hiring and training of plant management and staff for the facility 
government regulation our medical device products are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the fda  as well as other federal and state regulatory bodies in the us and comparable authorities in other countries 
we currently market our products in the us under authorizations from the fda  which are based on clearances of pre market notification submissions  or k  or approval of premarket approval applications  or pma 
if we seek to market new products  or to market new indications for our existing products  we will be required to obtain k clearance or pma approval  as applicable 
in january  the fda announced twenty five action items it intends to take with respect to the pre market notification process 
although the fda has not detailed the 
table of contents specific modifications or clarifications that it intends to make to its guidance  policies and regulations pertaining to the review and regulation of devices such as ours which seek and receive market clearance through the k pre market notification process  the fda s announced action items signal that additional regulatory requirements are likely 
these reforms  when implemented  could impose additional regulatory requirements upon us which could delay our ability to obtain new clearances  increase the costs of compliance  or restrict our ability to maintain our current clearances 
fda regulations govern the following activities that we perform  or that are performed on our behalf  to ensure that medical products distributed domestically or exported internationally are safe and effective for their intended uses product design  development and manufacture  product safety  testing  labeling and storage  clinical trials  record keeping  product marketing  sales and distribution  and post marketing safety surveillance  complaint handling  investigating reports of adverse events and malfunctions  reporting of serious injuries  including deaths  repairs  and recall of products 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the fda  which may be preceded by notices of deficiencies or noncompliance via inspectional observations on form fda  or s  general correspondence known as untitled letters  and more formal letters called warning letters 
if we do not adequately and appropriately address the cited deficiencies or noncompliance  including the repair  replacement or recall of affected products if necessary  within a reasonable period of time  the fda may take any one or more the following actions  which could adversely affect our business order a mandatory recall  physically seize the affected products  seek a court ordered injunction and consent decree that could include  but may not be limited to  operating restrictions  additional government oversight of our operations  specific corrective and preventative actions  and partial suspension or total shutdown of production  suspend review or refuse to clear pending k submissions or approvals pending for new products  new intended uses  or modifications to existing products  after notice and an opportunity for a hearing  withdraw k clearances or pma approvals that have already been granted  impose civil monetary penalties  and initiate criminal prosecution

item a 
risk factors risks related to our business and industry we are dependent on the success of our consoles and catheters and cannot be certain that ivus and ffr technology or our ivus and ffr products will achieve the broad acceptance necessary for us to sustain a profitable business 
our revenues are primarily derived from sales of our intravascular ultrasound  or ivus  and fractional flow reserve  or ffr  products  which include our multi modality consoles and our single procedure disposable catheters and fractional flow reserve wires 
ivus technology is widely used in japan for determining the placement of stents in patients with coronary disease but the penetration rate in the us and europe for the same type of procedure is relatively low 
our wires are used to measure the pressure and flow characteristics of blood around plaque  enabling physicians to gauge the physiological impact of blood flow and pressure 
we expect that sales of our ivus and ffr products will continue to account for a majority of our revenues for the foreseeable future  however it is difficult to predict the penetration and future growth rate or size of the market for ivus and ffr technology 
the expansion of the ivus and ffr markets depends on a number of factors  such as physicians accepting the benefits of the use of ivus and ffr in conjunction with angiography  physician experience with ivus and ffr products either used alone or jointly used in a single percutaneous coronary intervention  or pci  the availability of training necessary for proficient use of ivus and ffr products  as well as willingness by physicians to participate in such training  the additional procedure time required for use of ivus and ffr compared to the perceived benefits  the perceived risks generally associated with the use of our products and procedures  especially our new products and procedures  the placement of our products in treatment guidelines published by leading medical organizations  the availability of alternative treatments or procedures that are perceived to be or are more effective  safer  easier to use or less costly than ivus and ffr technology  hospitals willingness  and having sufficient budgets  to purchase our ivus and ffr products  
table of contents the size and growth rate of the pci  market in the major geographies in which we operate  the availability of adequate reimbursement  and the success of our marketing efforts and publicity regarding ivus and ffr technology 
even if ivus and ffr technology gain wide market acceptance  our ivus and ffr products may not adequately address market requirements and may not continue to gain market acceptance among physicians  healthcare payors and the medical community due to factors such as the lack of perceived benefits of information related to plaque composition available to the physician through use of our ivus products  including the ability to identify calcified and other forms of plaque  the lack of perceived benefits of information related to pressure and flow characteristics of blood around plaque available to the physician through the use of our ffr products  the actual and perceived ease of use of our ivus and ffr products  the quality of the images rendered by our ivus products  the quality of the measurements provided by our ffr products  the cost  performance  benefits and reliability of our ivus and ffr products relative to competing products and services  the lack of perceived benefit of integration of our ivus and ffr products into the catheterization laboratory  or cath lab  and the extent and timing of technological advances 
if ivus and ffr technology generally  or our ivus and ffr products specifically  do not gain wide market acceptance  we may not be able to achieve our anticipated growth  revenues or profitability and our results of operations would suffer 
the risks inherent in our international operations may adversely impact our revenues  results of operations and financial condition 
we derive  and anticipate that we will continue to derive  a significant portion of our revenues from operations in japan and europe 
as we expand internationally  we will need to hire  train and retain qualified personnel for our manufacturing and direct sales efforts  retain distributors and train their and our manufacturing  sales and other personnel in countries where language  cultural or regulatory impediments may exist 
we cannot ensure that distributors  physicians  regulators or other government agencies will accept our products  services and business practices 
further  we purchase  and in the future will manufacture  some components in foreign markets 
the manufacture  sale and shipment of our products and services across international borders  as well as the purchase of components from non us sources  subject us to extensive non us and foreign governmental trade regulations 
current or future trade  social and environmental regulations or political issues could restrict the supply of resources used in production or increase our costs 
compliance with such regulations is costly 
any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could impact us in a variety of ways that include  but are not limited to  significant criminal  civil and administrative penalties  including imprisonment of individuals  fines and penalties  denial of export privileges  seizure of shipments and restrictions on certain business activities 
failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could result in the disruption of our manufacturing  shipping and sales activities 
our international sales operations expose us and our representatives  agents and distributors to risks inherent in operating in foreign jurisdictions  including our ability to obtain  and the costs associated with obtaining  us export licenses and other required export or import licenses or approvals  changes in duties and tariffs  taxes  trade restrictions  license obligations and other non tariff barriers to trade  
table of contents burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations related to healthcare products  costs of localizing product and service offerings for foreign markets  business practices favoring local companies  longer payment cycles and difficulties collecting receivables through foreign legal systems  difficulties in enforcing or defending agreements and intellectual property rights  differing local product preferences  including as a result of differing reimbursement practices  possible failure to comply with anti bribery laws such as the united states foreign corrupt practices act and similar anti bribery laws in other jurisdictions  even though non compliance could be inadvertent  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and their impact on our operating results  and changes in foreign political or economic conditions 
in addition  we face risks associated with potential increased costs associated with overlapping tax structures  including the tax costs associated with repatriating cash 
for example  the obama administration has announced potential legislative proposals to tax profits of us companies earned abroad 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from our international operations  and while it is impossible for us to predict whether these and other proposals will be implemented  or how they will ultimately impact us  they may materially impact our results of operations if  for example  any future potential profits earned abroad are subject to us income tax  or we are otherwise disallowed deductions as a result of any such profits 
we cannot ensure that one or more of these factors will not harm our business 
any material decrease in our international revenues or inability to expand our international operations would adversely impact our revenues  results of operations and financial condition 
declines in the number of pci procedures performed for any reason will adversely impact our business 
our ivus and ffr products are used in connection with procedures 
physicians may choose to perform less pci procedures 
for example  recently the number of pci procedures declined  in part due to concerns attributed to efficacy of therapeutic treatment options  economic constraints  reduced number of restenosis  the long term efficacy of drug eluting stents and concerns by clinicians and payers regarding the appropriateness of conducting pci procedures 
if the number of pci procedures continues to decline  the need for ivus and ffr procedures could also decline  which would adversely impact our operating results and our business prospects 
we have a limited operating history  have only recently achieved profitability and cannot assure you that we will continue to achieve and sustain profitability in future periods 
we were formed in january and achieved our first and second full year of profitability in and to the extent that we are able to increase revenues  we expect our operating expenses will also increase as we expand our business to meet anticipated growing demand for our products  as we devote resources to our sales  marketing and research and development activities and as we satisfy our debt service obligations 
if we are unable to reduce our cost of revenues and our operating expenses  we may not achieve sustained profitability 
we expect to experience quarterly fluctuations in our revenues due to the timing of capital purchases by our customers and to a lesser degree the seasonality of disposable consumption by our customers 
additionally  expenses will fluctuate as we make future investments in research and development  selling and marketing and general and administrative activities  including as a result of new product introductions  transition from distributor arrangements to a direct sales force in different markets  satisfy our debt service obligations  and fund our litigation costs 
this will cause us to experience variability in our reported earnings and losses in future periods 
you should not rely on our operating results for any prior quarterly or annual period as an indication of our future operating performance 

table of contents we have a significant amount of indebtedness 
we may not be able to generate enough cash flow from our operations to service our indebtedness  and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have a significant amount of indebtedness  including million in aggregate principal with additional accrued interest of indebtedness under our convertible senior notes due  or the notes 
our ability to make payments on  and to refinance  our indebtedness  including the notes  and to fund planned capital expenditures  research and development efforts  working capital  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes depends on our ability to generate cash in the future 
this  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to pay our indebtedness  including payments of principal upon conversion of the notes or on their maturity or in connection with a transaction involving us that constitutes a fundamental change under the indenture governing the notes  or to fund our liquidity needs  we may be forced to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness  including the notes  on or before the maturity thereof  sell assets  reduce or delay capital expenditures  seek to raise additional capital or take other similar actions 
we may not be able to execute any of these actions on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our financial condition at the time  the restrictions in the instruments governing our indebtedness and other factors  including market conditions 
in addition  in the event of a default under the notes  the holders and or the trustee under the indenture governing the notes may accelerate our payment obligations under the notes  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations  or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all  would likely have an adverse effect  which could be material  on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  our significant indebtedness  combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments  could have other important consequences 
for example  it could make us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general us and worldwide economic  industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and our industry  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt  and limit our ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital  capital expenditures  research and development efforts  acquisitions  debt service requirements  execution of our business strategy or other purposes 
any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  if we incur additional indebtedness  which we are not prohibited from doing under the terms of the indenture governing the notes  the risks related to our business and our ability to service our indebtedness would increase 
competition from companies  particularly those that have longer operating histories and greater resources than us  may harm our business 
the medical device industry  including the market for ivus and ffr products  is highly competitive  subject to rapid technological change and significantly affected by new product introductions and market activities of other participants 
as a result  even if the size of the ivus and ffr market increases  we can make no assurance that our revenues will increase 
in addition  as the markets for medical devices  including ivus and ffr products  develop  additional competitors could enter the market 
to compete effectively  we will need to continue to demonstrate that our products are attractive relative to alternative devices and treatments 
we believe that our continued success depends on our ability to innovate and maintain scientifically advanced technology  
table of contents apply our technology across products and markets  develop proprietary products  successfully conduct  sponsor or participate in clinical studies that expand our markets  obtain and maintain patent protection for our products  obtain and maintain regulatory clearance or approvals  manufacture cost effectively and with consistently adequate quality  successfully market our products  and attract and retain skilled personnel 
with respect to our ivus products  our primary competitor is boston scientific  inc  or boston scientific 
our ffr products compete with the products of st 
jude medical  inc  or st 
jude 
we also compete in japan with respect to ivus products with terumo corporation  or terumo 
boston scientific  st 
jude  terumo and other potential competitors who are or may be substantially larger than us may enjoy competitive advantages  including more established distribution networks  entrenched relationships with physicians  products and procedures that are less expensive  broader ranges of products and services that may be sold in bundled arrangements  greater experience in launching  marketing  distributing and selling products  greater experience in obtaining and maintaining fda and other regulatory clearances and approvals  established relationships with healthcare providers and payors  and greater financial and other resources for product development  sales and marketing  acquisitions of products and companies  and intellectual property protection 
for these and other reasons  we may not be able to compete successfully against our current or potential future competitors  and sales of our ivus and ffr products may decline 
failure to innovate may adversely impact our competitive position and may adversely impact our ability to drive price increases for our products and our product revenues 
our future success will depend upon our ability to innovate new products and introduce enhancements to our existing products in order to address the changing needs of the marketplace 
we also rely on new products and product enhancements to attempt to drive price increases for our products in our markets 
frequently  product development programs require assessments to be made of future clinical need and commercial feasibility  which are difficult to predict 
customers may forego purchases of our products and purchase our competitors products as a result of delays in introduction of our new products and enhancements  failure to choose correctly among technical alternatives or failure to offer innovative products or enhancements at competitive prices and in a timely manner 
in addition  announcements of new products may result in a delay in or cancellation of purchasing decisions in anticipation of such new products 
we may not have adequate resources to introduce new products in time to effectively compete in the marketplace 
any delays in product releases may negatively affect our business 
we also compete with new and existing alternative technologies that are being used to penetrate the worldwide vascular imaging market without using ivus technology 
these products  procedures or solutions could prove to be more effective  faster  safer or less costly than our ivus products 
technologies such as 
table of contents angiography  angioscopy  multi slice computed tomography  intravascular magnetic resonance imaging  or mri  electron beam computed tomography  and mri with contrast agents are being used in lieu of or for imaging the vascular system 
we also develop and manufacture optical monitors  laser and non laser light sources  and optical engines used in optical coherence tomography  or oct  imaging systems as well as micro optical spectrometers and optical channel monitors with applications in telecommunications  pharmaceutical manufacturing  high speed industrial process control  and chemical and petrochemical processing  medical diagnostics  and scientific discovery 
products developed by competitors based on tunable filter technology could compete on the basis of lower cost and other factors 
in addition  customers may build similar functionality directly into their products  which in turn could decrease the demand for our oct imaging systems and related products 
the introduction of new products  procedures or clinical solutions by competitors may result in price reductions  reduced margins  loss of market share and may render our products obsolete 
we cannot guarantee that these alternative technologies will not be commercialized and become viable alternatives to our products in the future  and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete successfully against them if they are commercialized 
the successful continuing development of our existing and new products depends on us maintaining strong relationships with physicians 
the research  development  marketing  and sales of our products are dependent upon our maintaining working relationships with physicians 
we rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and experience regarding the development  marketing and sale of our products 
if we are unable to maintain our strong relationships with these professionals and continue to receive their advice and input  our existing and new products may not be developed and marketed in line with the needs and expectations of the professionals who use or would use and support our products and the development and marketing of our products could suffer  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
delays in planned product introductions may adversely affect our business and negatively impact future revenues 
we are currently developing new products as well as product enhancements with respect to our existing products 
we have in the past experienced  and may again in the future experience  delays in various phases of product development and commercial launch  including during research and development  manufacturing  limited release testing  marketing and customer education efforts 
in particular  developing and integrating products and technologies of acquired businesses is time consuming and in has in the past resulted  and may again in the future result  in longer developmental timelines than we initially anticipated 
we are currently engaged in ongoing litigation regarding our a high definition swept source non laser light source and b our efforts to develop and obtain a laser light source from third parties with lightlab imaging  inc  or lightlab  in delaware chancery court 
lightlab is a wholly owned subsidiary of st 
jude 
depending on the outcome of this litigation  we may experience delays in the commercial launch of our oct imaging systems 
any delays in our product launches may significantly impede our ability to successfully compete in our markets and may reduce our revenues 
we and our present and future collaborators may fail to develop or effectively commercialize products covered by our present and future collaborations if our collaborators become competitors of ours or enter into agreements with our competitors  we do not achieve our objectives under our collaboration agreements  we are unable to manage multiple simultaneous product discovery and development collaborations  
table of contents we develop products and processes or enter into additional collaborations that conflict with the business objectives of our other collaborators  we or our collaborators are unable to obtain patent protection for the products or proprietary technologies we develop in our collaborations  or we or our collaborators encounter regulatory hurdles that prevent commercialization of our products 
in addition  conflicts may arise with our collaborators  such as conflicts concerning the interpretation of clinical data  the achievement of milestones  the interpretation of financial provisions or the ownership of intellectual property developed during the collaboration 
if any conflicts arise with our existing or future collaborators  they may act in their self interest  which may be adverse to our best interest 
if we or our collaborators are unable to develop or commercialize products  or if conflicts arise with our collaborators  we will be delayed or prevented from developing and commercializing products which will harm our business and financial results 
if the clinical studies that we sponsor or co sponsor are unsuccessful  or clinical data from studies conducted by other industry participants are negative  we may not be able to develop or increase penetration in identified markets and our business prospects may suffer 
we sponsor or co sponsor several clinical studies to demonstrate the benefits of our products in current markets where we are trying to increase use of our products and in new markets 
implementing a study is time consuming and expensive  and the outcome is uncertain 
the completion of any of these studies may be delayed or halted for numerous reasons  including  but not limited to  the following the death of one or more patients during a clinical study for reasons that may or may not be related to our products  including the advanced stage of their disease or other medical problems  regulatory inspections of manufacturing facilities  which may  among other things  require us or a co sponsor to undertake corrective action or suspend the clinical studies  changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions  adverse side effects in patients  including adverse side effects from our or a co sponsor s drug candidate or device  the fda institutional review boards or other regulatory authorities do not approve a clinical study protocol or place a clinical study on hold  patients do not enroll in a clinical study or do not follow up at the expected rate  our co sponsors do not perform their obligations in relation to the clinical study or terminate the study  third party clinical investigators do not perform the clinical studies on the anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical study protocol and good clinical practices  or other third party organizations do not perform data collection and analysis in a timely or accurate manner  and the interim results of the clinical study are inconclusive or negative  and the study design  although approved and completed  is inadequate to demonstrate safety and efficacy of our products 
some of the studies that we co sponsor are designed to study the efficacy of a third party s drug candidate or device 
such studies are designed and controlled by the third party and the results of such studies will largely depend upon the success of the third party s drug candidate or device 
these studies may be terminated before completion for reasons beyond our control such as adverse events associated with a third party drug candidate or device 
a failure in such a study may have an adverse impact on our business by either the attribution of the study s failure to our technology or our inability to leverage publicity for proper functionality of our products as part of a failed study 

table of contents clinical studies may require the enrollment of large numbers of patients  and suitable patients may be difficult to identify and recruit 
patient enrollment in clinical studies and completion of patient follow up depend on many factors  including the size of the patient population  the study protocol  the proximity of patients to clinical sites  eligibility criteria for the study and patient compliance 
for example  patients may be discouraged from enrolling in our clinical studies if the applicable protocol requires them to undergo extensive post treatment procedures or if they are persuaded to participate in different contemporaneous studies conducted by other parties 
delays in patient enrollment or failure of patients to continue to participate in a study may result in an increase in costs  delays or the failure of the study 
such events may have a negative impact on our business by making it difficult to penetrate or expand certain identified markets 
further  if we are forced to contribute greater financial and clinical resources to a study  valuable resources will be diverted from other areas of our business 
negative results from clinical studies conducted by other industry participants could harm our results 
divestitures of any of our businesses or product lines may materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we continue to evaluate the performance of all of our businesses and may sell a business or product line 
any divestitures may result in significant write offs  including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
divestitures could involve additional risks  including difficulties in the separation of operations  services  products and personnel  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employees 
we may not be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that we encounter in divesting a business or product line 
if we choose to acquire new businesses  products or technologies  we may experience difficulty in the identification or integration of any such acquisition  and our business may suffer 
our success depends on our ability to continually enhance and broaden our product offerings in response to changing customer demands  competitive pressures and technologies 
accordingly  we have acquired  and may in the future acquire  complementary businesses  products or technologies instead of developing them ourselves 
we do not know if we will identify or complete any additional acquisitions  or whether we will be able to successfully integrate any acquired business  product or technology or retain key employees 
integrating any business  product or technology we acquire could be expensive and time consuming  disrupt our ongoing business and distract our management 
if we are unable to integrate any acquired businesses  products or technologies effectively  our business will suffer 
we have entered  and may in the future enter  markets through our acquisitions that we are not familiar with and have no experience managing 
if we fail to integrate these operations into our business  our resources may be diverted from our core business and this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business has become more decentralized geographically through our acquisitions and this may expose us to operating inefficiencies across these diverse locations  including difficulties and unanticipated expenses related to the integration of departments  information technology systems  and accounting records and maintaining uniform standards  such as internal controls  procedures and policies 
in addition  we have  and in the future may increase  our exposure to risks related to business operations outside the us due to our acquisitions 
we may also encounter risks  costs and expenses associated with any undisclosed or other unanticipated liabilities or use more cash and other financial resources on integration and implementation activities than we expect 
in addition  any amortization or other charges resulting from acquisitions could negatively impact our operating results 

table of contents if our products and technologies are unable to adequately identify the plaque that is most likely to rupture and cause a coronary event  we may not be able to develop a market for our vulnerable plaque products or expand the market for existing products 
we are utilizing substantial resources toward developing products and technologies to aid in the identification  diagnosis and treatment of the plaque that is most likely to rupture and cause a coronary event  or vulnerable plaque 
the providing regional observations to study predictors of events in the coronary tree study demonstrated the ability of ivus and virtual histology  or vh  to stratify lesions according to risk 
however  no randomized controlled trial has been performed to assess the benefit of treating or deferring treatment in these stratified lesions 
if we are unable to develop products or technologies that can identify vulnerable plaque  a market for products to identify vulnerable plaque may not materialize and our business may suffer 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in our reported revenues and earnings 
we do not engage in foreign currency hedging arrangements for our revenues or operating expenses  and  consequently  foreign currency fluctuations may adversely affect our revenues and earnings 
during the fiscal year ended december   and of our revenues were denominated in the yen and euro  respectively  of our operating expenses were denominated in the yen and of our operating expenses were denominated in the euro 
commencing october  we began using foreign currency forward contracts to manage a portion of the foreign currency risk related to our intercompany receivable balances with our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the euro and yen 
we cannot be assured our hedges will be effective or that the costs of the hedges will not exceed their benefits 
fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and foreign currencies  primarily the euro and the yen  could result in material amounts of cash being required to settle the hedge transactions or could adversely affect our financial results 
in periods of a strengthening us dollar relative to the yen or a weakening us dollar relative to the euro  we would record less revenue and our results of operations could be negatively impacted 
general national and worldwide economic conditions may materially and adversely affect our financial performance and results of operations 
our operations and performance depend significantly on national and worldwide economic conditions and the resulting impact on purchasing decisions and the level of spending on our products by customers in the geographic markets in which our ivus and ffr and other products are sold or distributed 
these economic conditions remain challenging in many countries and regions  including without limitation the us  japan  europe  the middle east and africa  where we have generated most of our revenues 
in the us  the recovery from the recent recession has been below historic averages and the unemployment rate is expected to remain high for some time 
inflation has fallen over the last several years  but is now rising  and central banks around the world have begun tightening monetary conditions to attempt to control inflation 
the march tsunami and associated events in japan negatively impacted many of our customers  as well as the conditions in which our tokyo based subsidiary operates 
such events may also result in a downturn in japan s economy as a whole  which may adversely affect our ability to conduct business in japan 
the challenging global economic conditions have also led to concerns over the solvency of certain european union member states  including greece  ireland  italy  portugal and spain 
on august   standard poor s downgraded the us credit rating to aa from its top rank of aaa  and the current us debt ceiling and budget deficit concerns have increased the possibility of other credit rating agency downgrades that could have a material adverse effect on the financial markets and economic conditions in the us and throughout the world 
likewise  the political unrest in the middle east may have adverse consequences to the global economy or to our customers in the middle east  which could negatively impact our business 
in any event  uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments 
if our customers do not obtain or do not have access to the necessary capital to operate their businesses  or are otherwise adversely affected by the deterioration in national and worldwide economic conditions  this could result in reductions in the sales of our 
table of contents products  longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies by our customers  which would materially and adversely affect our business 
we experienced declines in the number of pci procedures performed and related reductions in sales of our ivus products and in sales of our non medical products to telecommunication and industrial companies during due to  in part  the then prevailing economic conditions 
in addition  our customers  distributors and suppliers liquidity  capital resources and credit may be adversely affected by their relative ability or inability to obtain capital and credit  which could adversely affect our ability to collect on our outstanding invoices or lengthen our collection cycles  distribute our products or limit our timely access to important sources of raw materials necessary for the manufacture of our consoles and catheters 
we have invested our excess cash in money market funds and corporate debt securities issued by banks and corporations 
the interest paid on these types of investments and the value of certain securities may decline 
while our investment portfolio has experienced reduced yields  we have not yet experienced a deterioration of the credit quality of our holdings or other material adverse effects 
there can be no assurances that our investment portfolio will not experience any such deterioration in credit quality or other material adverse effects in future periods  or that national and worldwide economic conditions will not worsen 
our transition to a direct sales force in japan may not be successful or may cause us to incur additional expenses and experience reduced revenues sooner than initially planned 
if we are not successful or incur such additional expenses sooner than expected  then our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 
historically  a significant portion of our annual revenues have been derived from sales to our japanese distributors 
we have recently completed the termination of our distributor relationships in japan  and have fully transitioned to a direct sales force in japan 
there is no assurance that we will be successful in our transition to a direct sales force in japan and that we will be able to continue to successfully place  sell and service our products in japan through a direct sales force or to successfully insure the growth of our direct sales force that may be needed in the future 
our challenges and potential risks in connection with expanding our direct sales force in japan include  but are not limited to  a the successful retention and servicing of current dealers and customers in japan  b strong market adoption of our technology in japan  c the achievement of our growth and market development strategies in japan  d our ability to recruit  train and retain an expanded direct sales force in japan  and e the effect of the recent earthquake  tsunami and nuclear power plant meltdown in japan on operating conditions as well as end user demand 
in addition  we may incur significant additional expenses and reduced revenues 
our efforts to successfully expand our direct sales strategy in japan or the failure to achieve our sales objectives in japan may adversely impact our revenues  results of operations and financial condition and negatively impact our ability to sustain and grow our business in japan 
quality problems with our processes and products could harm our reputation for producing high quality products and erode our competitive advantage  sales  and market share 
the manufacture of our products is a highly exacting and complex process  due in part to strict regulatory requirements 
failure to manufacture our products in accordance with product specifications could result in increased costs  lost revenues  customer dissatisfaction or voluntary product recalls  any of which could harm our profitability and commercial reputation 
problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons  including equipment malfunction  failure to follow specific protocols and procedures  problems with raw materials  natural disasters  and environmental factors 
quality is extremely important to us and our customers due to the serious and costly consequences of product failure 
our quality certifications are critical to the marketing success of our products 
if we fail to meet these standards  our reputation could be damaged  we could lose customers  and our revenue and results of operations could decline 
aside from specific customer standards  our success depends generally on our ability to manufacture to exact tolerances precision engineered components  subassemblies  and finished devices from multiple materials 
if our components fail to meet these standards or fail to adapt to evolving standards  our reputation as a manufacturer of high quality devices will be harmed  our competitive advantage could be damaged  and we could lose customers and market share 

table of contents our manufacturing operations are dependent upon third party suppliers  some of which are sole sourced  which makes us vulnerable to supply problems  price fluctuations and manufacturing delays 
we rely on a number of sole source suppliers to supply transducers  substrates and processing for our scanners used in our catheters 
we do not carry significant inventory of transducers  substrates or scanner subassemblies 
if we had to change suppliers  we expect that it would take six to months to identify appropriate suppliers  complete design work and undertake the necessary inspections and testing before the new transducers and substrates would be available 
we are not parties to supply agreements with these suppliers but instead use purchase orders as needed 
our reliance on these sole source suppliers subjects us to a number of risks that could impact our ability to manufacture our products and harm our business  including inability to obtain adequate supply in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms  interruption or delayed delivery of supply resulting from our suppliers difficulty in accessing financial or credit markets or otherwise secure cash and capital resources  interruption of supply resulting from modifications to  or discontinuation of  a supplier s operations  delays in product shipments resulting from uncorrected defects  reliability issues or a supplier s variation in a component  uncorrected quality and reliability defects that impact performance  efficacy and safety of products from replacement suppliers  price fluctuations due to a lack of long term supply arrangements with our suppliers for key components  difficulty identifying and qualifying alternative suppliers for components in a timely manner  production delays related to the evaluation and testing of products from alternative suppliers and corresponding regulatory qualifications  and delays in delivery by our suppliers due to changes in demand from us or their other customers 
in addition  because we do not have long term supply agreements with some of our suppliers  we are subjected to the following risks unscheduled price increases  lack of notice when the materials used to manufacture are not available  lack of notice of discontinued operations or manufacturing 
we also utilize lean manufacturing processes that attempt to optimize the timing of our inventory purchases and supply levels of our inventories 
any significant delay or interruption in the supply of components or materials  or our inability to obtain substitute components or materials from alternate sources at acceptable prices and in a timely manner or to plan for sufficient inventory  could impair our ability to manufacture our products or meet the demand of our customers and harm our business 
identifying and qualifying additional or replacement suppliers for any of the components or materials used in our products  or obtaining additional inventory  if required  may not be accomplished quickly or at all and could involve significant additional costs 
any supply interruption from our suppliers or failure to obtain additional suppliers for any of the components or materials used to manufacture our products or sufficient inventory would limit our ability to manufacture our products and could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are constructing facilities in costa rica  may encounter a number of challenges relating to the construction  management and operation of such facilities  and the expansion has and will continue to increase our fixed costs  which may have a negative impact on our financial results and condition 
on september   we  through a wholly owned subsidiary  entered into a series of agreements to acquire real property and design and build manufacturing facilities in costa rica 
we have never established or operated 
table of contents manufacturing facilities outside the us  and cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully establish or operate these facilities in a timely or profitable manner  or at all 
we depend upon zona franca coyol  a third party construction company  to assist us in the design  construction and validation of the manufacturing facilities 
in addition  we will need to transfer our manufacturing processes  technology and know how to our costa rica facilities 
if we are unable to establish or operate these facilities or successfully transfer our manufacturing processes  technology and know how in a timely and cost effective manner  or at all  then we may experience disruptions in our operations  which could negatively impact our business and financial results 
we will need to obtain a number of permits and regulatory approvals prior  and subsequent  to commencing operations in such facilities 
our ability to obtain necessary permits and approvals may be subject to additional costs and possible delays beyond what we initially plan for 
in addition  our manufacturing facilities  and those of our suppliers  must comply with applicable regulatory requirements 
failure of our manufacturing facilities to comply with regulatory and quality requirements would harm our business and our results of operations 
our ability to operate this facility successfully will greatly depend on our ability to hire  train and retain an adequate number of employees  in particular employees with the appropriate level of knowledge  background and skills 
we will compete with several other medical device companies with manufacturing facilities in costa rica to hire these skilled employees 
should we be unable to hire such employees  and an adequate number of them  our business and financial results could be negatively impacted 
as we continue construction on these manufacturing facilities  our fixed costs will increase 
if we experience a demand in our products that exceeds our manufacturing capacity  we may not have sufficient inventory to meet our customers demands  which would negatively impact our revenues 
if the demand for our products decreases or if we do not produce the output we plan or anticipate after the facilities are operational  we may not be able to spread a significant amount of our fixed costs over the production volume  thereby increasing our per unit fixed cost  which would have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we also face particular commercial  jurisdictional and legal risks associated with our proposed expansion in costa rica 
the success of this relationship and our activities in costa rica in general are subject to the economic  political and legal conditions or developments in costa rica 
disruptions or other adverse developments during the construction and planned operations stage of our planned costa rica facilities could materially adversely affect our business 
if our costa rica operations are disrupted for any reason  we may be forced to locate alternative manufacturing facilities  including facilities operated by third parties 
disruptions may include  but are not limited to changes in the legal and regulatory environment in costa rica  slowdowns or work stoppages within the costa rican customs authorities  acts of god including but not limited to potential disruptive effects from an active volcano near the facility or earthquakes  hurricanes and other natural disasters  and other issues associated with significant operations that are remote from our headquarters and operations centers 
additionally  continued growth in product sales could outpace the ability of our costa rican operation to supply products on a timely basis or cause us to take actions within our manufacturing operations which increase costs  complexity and timing 
locating alternative facilities would be time consuming  would disrupt our production and cause shipment delays and could result in damage to our reputation and profitability 
additionally  we cannot assure you that alternative manufacturing facilities would offer the same cost structure as our costa rica facility 
if our facilities or systems are damaged or destroyed  we may experience delays that could negatively impact our revenues or other adverse effects 
our facilities may be affected by natural or man made disasters 
if one of our facilities were affected by a disaster  we would be forced to rely on third party manufacturers or to shift production to another manufacturing facility 
in such an event  we would face significant delays in manufacturing which would prevent us from being able to sell our products 
in addition  our insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of the potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
furthermore  although our computer and 
table of contents communications systems are protected through physical and software safeguards  they are still vulnerable to fire  storm  flood  power loss  earthquakes  telecommunications failures  physical or software break ins  software viruses  and similar events  and any failure of these systems to perform for any reason and for any period of time could adversely impact our ability to operate our business 
we may require significant additional capital to pursue our growth strategy  and our failure to raise capital when needed could prevent us from executing our growth strategy 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term available for sale investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next months 
however  we may need to obtain additional financing to pursue our business strategy  to respond to new competitive pressures or to act on opportunities to acquire or invest in complementary businesses  products or technologies 
the timing and amount of our working capital and capital expenditure requirements may vary significantly depending on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our products  the revenues generated by our products  the need to adapt to changing technologies and technical requirements  and the costs related thereto  the costs associated with expanding our manufacturing  marketing  sales and distribution efforts  the existence and timing of opportunities for expansion  including acquisitions and strategic transactions  and costs and fees associated with defending existing or potential litigation 
in addition  we are required to make periodic interest payments to the holders of the notes and to make payments of principal upon conversion or maturity 
we may also be required to purchase the notes for cash upon the occurrence of a change of control or certain other fundamental changes involving us 
if our capital resources are insufficient to satisfy our debt service or liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or to obtain debt financing 
the sale of additional equity or debt securities  or the use of our stock in an acquisition or strategic transaction  would result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
additional debt would result in increased expenses and could result in covenants that would restrict our operations 
we have not made arrangements to obtain additional financing and our significant historical losses and the current national and global financial conditions may prevent us from obtaining additional funds on favorable terms  if at all 
we are dependent on our collaborations  and events involving these collaborations or any future collaborations could delay or prevent us from developing or commercializing products 
the success of our current business strategy and our near and long term viability will depend on our ability to execute successfully on existing strategic collaborations and to establish new strategic collaborations 
collaborations allow us to leverage our resources and technologies and to access markets that are compatible with our own core areas of expertise 
to penetrate our target markets  we may need to enter into additional collaborative agreements to assist in the development and commercialization of future products 
establishing strategic collaborations is difficult and time consuming 
potential collaborators may reject collaborations based upon their assessment of our financial  regulatory or intellectual property position or our internal capabilities 
our discussions with potential collaborators may not lead to the establishment of new collaborations on favorable terms or at all 
we have collaborations with a number of entities  including medtronic  inc  the cleveland clinic foundation  general electric company  siemens ag  philips medical systems nederland bv  and abbott 
in each collaboration  we combine our technology or core capabilities with those of the third party to permit either greater penetration into markets or to enhance the functionality of our current and planned products 
we have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that our current collaborators or any future collaborators 
table of contents devote to our collaborations or potential products 
these collaborators may breach or terminate their agreements with us or otherwise fail to conduct their collaborative activities successfully and in a timely manner 
further  our collaborators may not develop or commercialize products that arise out of our collaborative arrangements or devote sufficient resources to the development  manufacture  marketing or sale of these products 
moreover  in the event of termination of a collaboration agreement  we may not realize the intended benefits or we may not be able to replace the arrangement on comparable terms or at all 
if the third party distributors that we rely on to market and sell our products are not successful  we may be unable to increase or maintain our level of revenues 
a portion of our revenue is generated by our third party distributors  especially in international markets 
if these distributors cease or limit operations or experience a disruption of their business operations  or are not successful in selling our products  we may be unable to increase or maintain our level of revenues  and any such developments could negatively affect our international sales strategy 
over the long term  we intend to grow our business internationally  and to do so we will need to attract additional distributors to expand the territories in which we do not directly sell our products 
our distributors may not commit the necessary resources to market and sell our products 
if current or future distributors do not continue to distribute our products or do not perform adequately or if we are unable to locate distributors in particular geographic areas  we may not realize revenue growth internationally 
our reported or future financial results could be adversely affected by the application of existing or future accounting standards 
us generally accepted accounting principles and related implementation guidelines and interpretations can be highly complex and involve subjective judgments 
changes in these rules or their interpretation  the adoption of new guidance or the application of existing guidance to changes in our business could have a significant adverse effect on our financial results 
for example  the accounting for convertible debt securities  and the accounting for the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions we entered into in connection with the offering of the notes  is subject to frequent scrutiny by the accounting regulatory bodies and is subject to change 
we cannot predict if or when any such change could be made and any such change could have an adverse impact on our reported or future financial results 
in addition  in the event the conversion features of the notes are triggered  we could be required under applicable accounting standards to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the notes as a current rather than long term liability  which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital 
we cannot assure you that our net operating loss carryforwards will be available to reduce our tax liability 
our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future income tax obligations may be limited or reduced 
generally  a change of more than percentage points in the ownership of our shares  by value  over the three year period ending on the date the shares were acquired constitutes an ownership change and may limit our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards 
should additional ownership changes occur in the future  our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards could be limited 
if we fail to properly manage our anticipated growth  our business could suffer 
rapid growth of our business is likely to continue to place a significant strain on our managerial  operational and financial resources and systems 
to execute our anticipated growth successfully  we must attract and retain qualified personnel and manage and train them effectively 
we anticipate hiring additional personnel to assist in the commercialization of our current products and in the development of future products 
we will be dependent on our personnel and third parties to effectively market and sell our products to an increasing number of customers 
we will also depend on our personnel to develop and manufacture in anticipated increased volumes our existing products  as well as new products and product enhancements 
further  our anticipated growth will 
table of contents place additional strain on our suppliers resulting in increased need for us to carefully monitor for quality assurance 
any failure by us to manage our growth effectively could have an adverse effect on our ability to achieve our development and commercialization goals 
issues arising from the implementation of our new enterprise resource planning system could adversely affect our operating results and ability to manage our business effectively 
we have begun implementing a new enterprise resource planning  or erp  system to further enhance operating efficiencies and provide more effective management of our business operations 
the new erp system is being deployed for use throughout our company in a number of go live phases  the first of which occurred during the fourth quarter of with company wide deployment expected to be completed during the second quarter of implementing a new erp system is costly and involves risks inherent in the conversion to a new computer system  including loss of information  disruption to our normal operations  changes in accounting procedures and internal control over financial reporting  as well as problems achieving accuracy in the conversion of electronic data 
failure to properly or adequately address these issues could result in increased costs  the diversion of management s and employees attention and resources and could materially adversely affect our operating results  internal controls over financial reporting and ability to manage our business effectively 
while the erp system is intended to further improve and enhance our information systems  large scale implementation of a new information system exposes us to the risks of starting up the new system and integrating that system with our existing systems and processes  including possible disruption of our financial reporting  which could lead to a failure to make required filings under the federal securities laws on a timely basis 
any defects or malfunctions in the computer hardware or software we utilize in our products could cause severe performance failures in such products  which would harm our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our existing and new products depend and will depend on the continuous  effective and reliable operation of computer hardware and software 
for example  our ivus products utilize sophisticated software that analyzes in real time plaque composition and identifies lumen and vessel borders  which are then displayed in three dimensional  color coded images on a computer screen 
any defect  malfunction or other failing in the computer hardware or software utilized by our ivus or other products  including products we develop in the future  could result in inaccurate readings  misinterpretations of data  or other performance failures that could render our products unreliable or ineffective and could lead to decreased confidence in our products  damage to our reputation  reduction in our sales and product liability claims  the occurrence of any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
although we update the computer software utilized in our products on a regular basis  there can be no guarantee that defects do not or will not in the future exist or that unforeseen malfunctions  whether within our control or otherwise  will not occur 
if we are unable to recruit  hire and retain skilled and experienced personnel  our ability to effectively manage and expand our business will be harmed 
our success largely depends on the skills  experience and efforts of our officers and other key employees who may terminate their employment at any time 
the loss of any of our senior management team  in particular our president and chief executive officer  r 
scott huennekens  could harm our business 
we have entered into employment contracts or similar agreements with r 
scott huennekens  our chief financial officer  john t 
dahldorf  our executive vice president  global sales  jorge j 
quinoy  and michel lussier  president of volcano europe and clinical and scientific affairs  advanced imaging systems  scientific affairs  and emea  but these agreements do not guarantee that they will remain employed by us in the future 
the announcement of the loss of one of our key employees could negatively affect our stock price 
our ability to retain our skilled workforce and our success in attracting and hiring new skilled employees will be a critical factor in determining whether we will be successful in the future 
we face challenges in hiring  training  managing and retaining employees in certain 
table of contents areas including clinical  technical  sales and marketing 
this could delay new product development and commercialization  and hinder our marketing and sales efforts  which would adversely impact our competitiveness and financial results 
the expense and potential unavailability of insurance coverage for our company  customers or products may have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
while we currently have insurance for our business  property  directors and officers  and product liability  insurance is increasingly costly and the scope of coverage is narrower  and we may be required to assume more risk in the future 
if we are subject to claims or suffer a loss or damage in excess of our insurance coverage  we will be required to cover the amounts outside of or in excess of our insurance limits 
if we are subject to claims or suffer a loss or damage that is outside of our insurance coverage  we may incur significant costs associated with loss or damage that could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
furthermore  any claims made on our insurance policies may impact our ability to obtain or maintain insurance coverage at reasonable costs or at all 
we do not have the financial resources to self insure  and it is unlikely that we will have these financial resources in the foreseeable future 
our product liability insurance covers our products and business operations  but we may need to increase and expand this coverage commensurate with our expanding business 
any product liability claims brought against us  with or without merit  could result in substantial costs of related litigation or regulatory action  substantial monetary penalties or awards  decreased demand for our products  reduced revenue or market penetration  injury to our reputation  withdrawal of clinical study participants  an inability to establish new strategic relationships  increased product liability insurance rates  and an inability to secure continuing coverage 
some of our customers and prospective customers may have difficulty in procuring or maintaining liability insurance to cover their operation and use of our products 
medical malpractice carriers are withdrawing coverage in certain regions or substantially increasing premiums 
if this trend continues or worsens  our customers may discontinue using our products and potential customers may opt against purchasing our products due to the cost or inability to procure insurance coverage 
compliance with changing corporate governance and public disclosure regulations may result in additional expenses 
changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act  new sec regulations and nasdaq global select market rules  are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours 
to maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure  we have invested  and intend to continue to invest  in reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards 
these investments have resulted in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities and may continue to do so in the future 

table of contents risks related to government regulation if we fail to obtain or maintain  or experience significant delays in obtaining  regulatory clearances or approvals for our products or product enhancements  our ability to commercially distribute and market our products could suffer 
our products are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal  state and foreign governmental authorities 
our failure to comply with such regulations or to make adequate  timely corrections  could lead to the imposition of injunctions  suspensions or loss of marketing clearances or approvals  product recalls  manufacturing cessation  termination of distribution  product seizures  civil penalties  or some combination of such actions 
the process of obtaining regulatory authorizations to market a medical device  particularly from the fda  can be costly and time consuming  and there can be no assurance that such authorizations will be granted on a timely basis  if at all 
if regulatory clearance or approvals are received  additional delays may occur related to manufacturing  distribution  or product labeling 
in addition  we cannot assure you that any new or modified medical devices we develop will be eligible for the shorter k clearance process as opposed to the pma process 
we have no experience in obtaining pma approvals 
in the member states of the european economic area  or eea  our medical devices are required to comply with the essential requirements of the eu medical devices directives before they can be marketed 
our products  including their design and manufacture  have been certified by the british standards institute  or bsi  a united kingdom notified body  as being compliant with the requirements of the medical devices directives 
consequently  we are entitled to affix a ce mark to our products and their packaging and this gives us the right to sell them in the eea 
if we fail to maintain compliance with the medical devices directives  our products will no longer qualify for the ce mark and the relevant devices would not be eligible for marketing in the eea 
we currently market our ivus and ffr products in japan under two types of regulatory approval known as a shonin and a ninsho 
as the holder of the shonins  we have the authority to import and sell those products for which we have the shonins as well as those products for which we have obtained a ninsho 
responsibility for japanese regulatory filings and future compliance resides with us 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to adequately meet japanese regulatory requirements 
non compliance with japanese regulations may result in action to prohibit further importation and sale of our products in japan  a significant market for our products 
if we are unable to sell our ivus and ffr products in japan  we will lose a significant part of our annual revenues  and our business will be substantially impacted 
foreign governmental authorities that regulate the manufacture and sale of medical devices have become increasingly stringent  and to the extent we continue to market and sell our products in foreign countries  we will be subject to rigorous regulation in the future 
in such circumstances  where we utilize distributors in foreign countries to market and sell our products  we would rely significantly on our distributors to comply with the varying regulations  and any failures on their part could result in restrictions on the sale of our products in foreign countries 
regulatory delays or failures to obtain and maintain marketing authorizations  including k clearances and pma approvals  could disrupt our business  harm our reputation  and adversely affect our sales 
modifications to our products may require new regulatory clearances or approvals or may require us to recall or cease marketing our products until clearances or approvals are obtained 
modifications to our products may require the submission of new k notifications or pma applications 
if a modification is implemented to address a safety concern  we may also need to initiate a recall or cease distribution of the affected device 
in addition  if the modified devices require the submission of a k or pma and we distribute such modified devices without a new k clearance or pma approval  we may be required to recall or cease distributing the devices 
the fda can review a manufacturer s decision not to submit a modification and may disagree 
the fda may also on its own initiative determine that clearance of a new k or approval of a new pma submission is required 
we have made modifications to our products in the past and may make additional modifications in the future that we believe do not or will not require clearance of a new k or approval of a new pma 
if we begin manufacture and distribution of the modified devices and the 
table of contents fda later disagrees with our determination and requires the submission of a new k or pma for the modifications  we may also be required to recall the distributed modified devices and to stop distribution of the modified devices  which could have an adverse effect on our business 
if the fda does not clear or approve the modified devices  we may need to redesign the devices  which could also harm our business 
when a device is marketed without a required clearance or approval  the fda has the authority to bring an enforcement action  including injunction  seizure and  in egregious circumstances  criminal prosecution 
the fda considers such additional actions generally when there is a serious risk to public health or safety and the company s corrective and preventive actions are inadequate to address the fda s concerns 
where we determine that modifications to our products require clearance of a new k or approval of a new pma or pma supplement  we may not be able to obtain those additional clearances or approvals for the modifications or additional indications in a timely manner  or at all 
for those products sold in the eea  we must notify bsi  our eea notified body  if significant changes are made to the products or if there are substantial changes to our quality assurance systems affecting those products 
delays in obtaining required future clearances or approvals would adversely affect our ability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner  which in turn would harm our future growth 
the fda is reviewing the k process and could change the criteria to obtain clearance which could affect our ability to obtain timely reviews and increase the resources needed to meet new criteria 
over the past several years  concerns have been raised about whether the k program optimally achieves its intended goals 
the fda released for public comment in august a set of preliminary reports and recommendations from an internal k working group and task force on the utilization of science in regulatory decision making 
in january  the fda announced action items it intends to take with respect to the pre market notification process 
although the fda has not detailed the specific modifications or clarifications that it intends to make to its guidance  policies and regulations pertaining to the review and regulation of devices such as ours which seek and receive market clearance through the k pre market notification process  it has issued several draft guidance documents that  if implemented  will likely entail additional regulatory burdens 
these additional regulatory burdens could delay our ability to obtain new clearances  increase the costs of compliance  or restrict our ability to maintain our current clearances 
in the future  the fda will announce which draft guidance documents it will finalize and implement  along with any other recommended improvements  and the timeline for their implementation 
if the fda makes changes to the k program  we may be required to prepare and submit more data and information than is currently required  which could require additional resources and more expense  require more time to prepare a submission  and result in a longer review period by the fda 
such changes could adversely affect our business 
if we or our suppliers fail to comply with the fda s quality system regulation or iso quality management systems  manufacturing of our products could be negatively impacted and sales of our products could suffer 
our manufacturing practices must be in compliance with the fda s cfr part quality system regulation  or qsr  which governs the facilities  methods  controls  procedures  and records of the design  manufacture  packaging  labeling  storage  shipping  installation  and servicing of our products intended for human use 
we are also subject to similar state and foreign requirements and licenses  including the mdd eec and the iso quality management systems  or qms  standard applicable to medical devices 
in addition  we must engage in regulatory reporting in the case of potential patient safety risks and must make available our manufacturing facilities  procedures  and records for periodic inspections and audits by governmental agencies  including the fda  state authorities and comparable foreign agencies 
if we fail to comply with the qsr  qms  or other applicable regulations and standards  our operations could be disrupted and our manufacturing interrupted  and we may be subject to enforcement actions if our corrective and preventive actions are not adequate to ensure compliance 

table of contents failure to take adequate corrective action in response to inspectional observations or any notice of deficiencies from a regulatory inspection or audit could result in partial or total shut down of our manufacturing operations unless and until adequate corrections are implemented  voluntary or fda ordered recall  fda seizure of affected devices  court ordered injunction or consent decree that could impose additional regulatory oversight and significant requirements and limitations on our manufacturing operations  significant fines  suspension or withdrawal of marketing clearances and approvals  and criminal prosecutions  any of which would cause our business to suffer 
furthermore  our key component suppliers may not currently be or may not continue to be in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements  which may result in manufacturing delays for our products and cause our revenue to decline 
the fda  bsi  japan s pharmaceutical medical device administration  or pmda  and other regulatory agencies and bodies have previously imposed inspections and audits on us  and may in the future impose additional inspections or audits at any time which may conclude that our quality system is noncompliant with applicable regulations and standards 
such findings could potentially disrupt our business  harm our reputation and adversely affect our sales 
our products may in the future be subject to product recalls or voluntary market withdrawals that could harm our reputation  business and financial results 
the fda and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture that could affect patient safety 
in the case of the fda  the authority to require a recall must be based on an fda finding that there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death 
manufacturers may  under their own initiative  recall a product if any material deficiency in a device is found or suspected 
for example  in we recalled our xtract catheter in circumstances where no patient safety incident was reported but where we had evidence that the device s integrity could be compromised under certain storage conditions 
a government mandated recall or voluntary recall by us or one of our distributors could occur as a result of component failures  manufacturing errors  design or labeling defects or other issues 
recalls  which include corrections as well as removals  of any of our products would divert managerial and financial resources and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition  harm our reputation with customers  and reduce our ability to achieve expected revenues 
we are required to comply with medical device reporting  or mdr  requirements and must report certain malfunctions  deaths  and serious injuries associated with our products  which can result in voluntary corrective actions or agency enforcement actions 
under the fda mdr regulations  medical device manufacturers are required to submit information to the fda when they receive a report or become aware that a device has or may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or has or may have a malfunction that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur 
all manufacturers placing medical devices on the market in the eea are legally bound to report any serious or potentially serious incidents involving devices they produce or sell to the competent authority in whose jurisdiction the incident occurred 
were this to happen to us  the relevant competent authority would file an initial report  and there would then be a further inspection or assessment if there were particular issues 
this would be carried out either by the competent authority or it could require that the bsi  as the notified body  carry out the inspection or assessment 
malfunction of our products could result in future voluntary corrective actions  such as recalls  including corrections  or customer notifications  or agency action  such as inspection or enforcement actions 
malfunctions have been reported to us in the past  and  while we investigated each of the incidents and believe we have taken the necessary corrective and preventive actions  we cannot guarantee that similar or different malfunctions will not occur in the future 
if malfunctions do occur  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to correct the malfunctions adequately or prevent further malfunctions  in which case we may need to cease manufacture and distribution of the affected devices  initiate voluntary recalls  and redesign the devices  nor can we ensure that 
table of contents regulatory authorities will not take actions against us  such as ordering recalls  imposing fines  or seizing the affected devices 
if someone is harmed by a malfunction or by product mishandling  we may be subject to product liability claims 
any corrective action  whether voluntary or involuntary  as well as defending ourselves in a lawsuit  will require the dedication of our time and capital  distract management from operating our business  and may harm our reputation and financial results 
we are subject to federal  state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations and implementation or changes to such healthcare laws and regulations could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
in an effort to contain rising healthcare costs  in march  president obama signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act  as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act  collectively  the ppaca  which may significantly affect the payment for  and the availability of  healthcare services and result in fundamental changes to federal healthcare reimbursement programs 
the ppaca includes  among other things  the following measures a deductible excise tax on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the us  with limited exceptions  effective  a new patient centered outcomes research institute to oversee  identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research  new reporting and disclosure requirements on device manufacturers for any transfer of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals  with the first report due on march   payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals  physicians and other providers to improve the coordination  quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models  beginning on or before january   and an independent payment advisory board that will submit recommendations to reduce medicare spending if projected medicare spending exceeds a specified growth rate 
we are unable to predict at this time the impact of such recently enacted federal healthcare reform legislation on the medical device industry in general  or on us in particular and what  if any  additional legislation or regulation relating to the medical device industry may be enacted in the future 
an expansion in the government s role in the us healthcare industry may cause general downward pressure on the prices of medical device products  lower reimbursements for procedures using our products  reduce medical procedure volumes and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
although we cannot predict the many ways that the federal healthcare reform laws might affect our business  we will be subject to the excise tax scheduled to take effect in it is unclear whether and to what extent  if at all  other anticipated developments resulting from the federal healthcare reform legislation  such as an increase in the number of people with health insurance and an increased focus on preventive medicine  may provide us additional revenue to offset this excise tax 
if additional revenue does not materialize  or if our efforts to offset the excise tax through spending cuts or other actions are unsuccessful  the increased tax burden would adversely affect our financial performance  which in turn could cause the price of our stock to decline 
in addition  a number of foreign governments are also considering or have adopted proposals to reform their healthcare systems 
because a significant portion of our revenues from our operations is derived internationally  if significant reforms are made to the healthcare systems in other jurisdictions  our sales and results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted 
we intend to market our products in a number of international markets 
although certain of our ivus products have been approved for commercialization in japan and in the eea  in order to market our products in other foreign jurisdictions  we have had to  and will need to in the future  obtain separate regulatory approvals 
the approval procedure varies among jurisdictions and can involve substantial additional testing 
approval or clearance of a device by the fda does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions  and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure marketing authorization by regulatory authorities in other foreign jurisdictions or by the fda 
the foreign regulatory approval process may include all of the risks 
table of contents associated with obtaining fda approval in addition to other risks 
in addition  the time required to obtain foreign approval may differ from that required to obtain fda approval  and we may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis  if at all 
we may not be able to file for regulatory approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any foreign market other than in the eea and japan 
we may be subject to federal  state and foreign healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations  and a finding of failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our operations may be directly or indirectly affected by various broad federal  state or foreign healthcare fraud and abuse laws 
in particular  the federal healthcare program anti kickback statute prohibits any person from knowingly and willfully offering  paying  soliciting or receiving remuneration  directly or indirectly  in return for or to induce the referring  ordering  leasing  purchasing or arranging for or recommending the ordering  purchasing or leasing of an item or service  for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs  such as the medicare and medicaid programs 
this statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between device manufacturers on one hand and prescribers and purchasers on the other 
for example  the government has sought to apply the anti kickback statute to device manufacturers financial relationships with physician consultants 
among other theories  the government has alleged that such relationships are payments to induce the consultants to arrange for or recommend the ordering  purchasing or leasing of the manufacturers products by the hospitals  medical institutions and other entities with whom they are affiliated 
although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions  the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly  and arrangements that involve remuneration that could induce prescribing  purchases  or recommendations may be subject to government scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or a safe harbor 
we are also subject to the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa  which created federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program or making false statements relating to health care matters  and federal sunshine laws that require transparency regarding financial arrangements with health care providers  such as the reporting and disclosure requirements imposed by ppaca on device and drug manufacturers regarding any transfer of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals 
also  the federal false claims act prohibits persons from knowingly filing  or causing to be filed  a false claim to  or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government 
suits filed under the false claims act  known as qui tam actions  can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government and such individuals  commonly known as whistleblowers  may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement 
when an entity is determined to have violated the false claims act  it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government  plus civil penalties for each separate false claim 
various states have also enacted laws modeled after the federal false claims act 
in addition  several states have adopted laws similar to each of the above federal laws  such as anti kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third party payor  including commercial insurers as well as laws that restrict our marketing activities with physicians  and require us to report consulting and other payments to physicians 
some states  such as california  connecticut massachusetts and nevada  mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs to ensure compliance with these laws 
the risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts  and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations 
moreover  recent health care reform legislation has strengthened these laws 
for example  the recently enacted ppaca  among other things  amends the intent requirement of the federal anti kickback and criminal health care fraud statutes  a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it 
in addition  ppaca provides that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims act 
further  we expect there will continue to be federal and state laws and or regulations  proposed and implemented  that could impact our operations and business 
the extent to which future legislation or 
table of contents regulations  if any  relating to health care fraud abuse laws and or enforcement  may be enacted or what effect such legislation or regulation would have on our business remains uncertain 
if our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us  we may be subject to penalties  including civil and criminal penalties  damages  fines  exclusion from governmental health care programs  and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations  any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results 
we also are subject to foreign fraud and abuse laws  which vary by country 
for instance  in the european union  legislation on inducements offered to physicians and other healthcare workers or hospitals differ from country to country 
breach of the laws relating to such inducements may expose us to the imposition of criminal sanctions 
it may also harm our reputation  which could in turn affect sales 
if our customers are unable to obtain coverage of or sufficient reimbursement for procedures performed with our products  it is unlikely that our products will be widely used 
successful sales of our products depend on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third party payors 
healthcare providers that purchase medical devices for treatment of their patients generally rely on third party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs and fees associated with the procedures performed with these devices 
both public and private insurance coverage and reimbursement plans are central to new product acceptance 
customers are unlikely to use our products if they do not receive reimbursement adequate to cover the cost of our products and related procedures 
to the extent we sell our products internationally  market acceptance may depend  in part  upon the availability of coverage and reimbursement within prevailing healthcare payment systems 
coverage  reimbursement  and healthcare payment systems in international markets vary significantly by country  and by region in some countries  and include both government sponsored healthcare and private insurance 
we may not obtain international reimbursement approvals in a timely manner  if at all 
our failure to receive international coverage or reimbursement approvals would negatively impact market acceptance of our products in the international markets in which those approvals are sought 
to date  our products have generally been covered as part of procedures for which reimbursement has been available 
however  in the us  as well as in foreign countries  government funded programs such as medicare and medicaid or private insurance programs  together commonly known as third party payors  pay the cost of a significant portion of a patient s medical expenses 
coverage of and reimbursement for medical technology can differ significantly from payor to payor 
all third party coverage and reimbursement programs  whether government funded or insured commercially  whether inside the us or outside  are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs 
such cost containment programs adopted by third party payors  including legislative and regulatory changes to coverage and reimbursement policies  could potentially limit the amount which healthcare providers are willing to pay for medical devices  which could adversely impact our business 
the centers for medicare medicaid services recently announced a three year demonstration project to allow medicare recovery auditors to audit medicare payments for procedures prior to medicare making payment for the procedure  versus following medicare payment for the procedure as has historically been medicare s process 
the demonstration project includes states that cover a large percentage of the us populace  and different states are expected to be more or less aggressive in their performance of pre payment audits  including with respect to the types of procedures for which medicare payments may be audited on a pre payment basis and the percentage of those procedures that are in fact so audited 
certain procedures that use our products will be subject to such medicare pre payment audits  which could induce healthcare providers to be less willing to perform those procedures due to increased reimbursement concerns owing to such pre payment  rather than post payment  audits  and any such reduction in procedure volumes could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

table of contents we believe that future coverage of and reimbursement for our products may be subject to increased restrictions both in the us and in international markets 
for example  on august   president obama signed the budget control act of which provides an initial increase to the us debt limit  imposes significant cuts in federal spending over the next decade and involves a second increase to the debt limit pending further deficit reduction by a bipartisan congressional committee later this year 
this committee could propose cuts to  and restructuring of  entitlement programs such as medicare and aid to states for medicaid programs 
third party reimbursement and coverage for our products may not be available or adequate in either the us or international markets 
future legislation  regulations  coverage or reimbursement policies adopted by third party payors may adversely affect the growth of the markets for our products  reduce the demand for our existing products or our products currently under development  and limit our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis 
we may be subject to health information privacy and security standards that include penalties for noncompliance 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa  and its implementing regulations safeguard the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information 
certain of our operations may be subject to these requirements 
penalties for noncompliance with these rules include both criminal and civil penalties 
in addition  the health information technology for economic and clinical health act  or hitech act  expanded federal health information privacy and security protections 
among other things  hitech makes certain of hipaa s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity 
hitech also set forth new notification requirements for health data security breaches  increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities  business associates and possibly other persons  and gave state attorneys general new authority to enforce hipaa and seek attorney s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions 
occasionally  our field service representatives enter into field service agreements which obligate us to protect any protected health information that we may receive in the field in accordance with hipaa and hitech 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations could be expensive  and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to significant liability 
we use hazardous materials in our research and development and manufacturing processes 
we are subject to federal  state and local regulations governing use  storage  handling and disposal of these materials and associated waste products 
we are currently licensed to handle such materials  but there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain these licenses in the future or obtain licenses under new regulations if and when they are required by governing authorities 
we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from hazardous materials  and we may incur liability as a result of any such contamination or injury 
in the event of an accident  we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines  and the liability could exceed our resources and any applicable insurance 
we have also incurred and may continue to incur expenses related to compliance with environmental laws 
such future expenses or liability could have a significant negative impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  we cannot assure that the cost of compliance with these laws and regulations will not materially increase in the future 
we may also incur expenses related to ensuring that our operations comply with environmental laws related to our operations  and those of prior owners or operators of our properties  at current or former manufacturing sites where operations have previously resulted in spills  discharges or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment 
we could be held strictly liable under us environmental laws for contamination of property that we currently or formerly owned or operated without regard to fault or whether our actions were in compliance with law at the time 
our liability could also increase if other responsible parties  including prior owners or operators of our facilities  fail to complete their clean up obligations or satisfy indemnification obligations to us 
similarly  if we fail to ensure compliance with applicable environmental laws in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate  we may not be able to offer our products and may be subject to civil or criminal liabilities 

table of contents the use  misuse or off label use of our products may result in injuries that could lead to product liability suits  which could be costly to our business 
our currently marketed products have been cleared by the relevant regulatory authority in each jurisdiction where we market them 
there may be increased risk of injury if physicians attempt to use our products in procedures outside of those indications cleared or approved for use  known as off label use 
our sales force is trained according to company policy not to promote our products for off label uses  and in our instructions for use in all markets we specify that our products are not intended for use outside of those indications cleared for use 
however  we cannot prevent a physician from using our products for off label applications 
our catheters and guide wires are intended to be single procedure products 
in spite of clear labeling and instructions against reuse  we are aware that certain physicians have elected to reuse our products 
reuse of our catheters and guide wires may increase the risk of product liability claims 
reuse may also subject the party reusing the product to regulatory authority inspection and enforcement action 
physicians may also misuse our product if they are not adequately trained  potentially leading to injury and an increased risk of product liability 
if our products are defectively designed  manufactured or labeled  contain defective components or are misused  we may become subject to costly litigation by our customers or their patients 
product liability claims could divert management s attention from our core business  be expensive to defend and result in sizable damage awards against us 
risks related to our intellectual property and litigation our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology through patents and other means is uncertain 
our success depends significantly on our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technologies 
our policy is to obtain and protect our intellectual property rights 
we rely on patent protection  as well as a combination of copyright  trade secret and trademark laws  and nondisclosure  confidentiality and other contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technology 
however  these legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage 
our pending us and foreign patent applications may not issue as patents or may not issue in a form that will be advantageous to us 
any patents we have obtained or will obtain may be challenged by re examination  opposition or other administrative proceeding  or in litigation 
such challenges could result in a determination that the patent is invalid 
in addition  competitors may be able to design alternative methods or devices that avoid infringement of our patents 
to the extent our intellectual property protection offers inadequate protection  or is found to be invalid  we are exposed to a greater risk of direct competition 
if our intellectual property does not provide adequate protection against our competitors products  our competitive position could be adversely affected  as could our business 
both the patent application process and the process of managing patent disputes can be time consuming and expensive 
furthermore  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the us in addition  changes in us patent laws could prevent or limit us from filing patent applications or patent claims to protect our products and or technologies or limit the exclusivity periods that are available to patent holders 
the leahy smith america invents act  or the leahy smith act  was recently signed into law and includes a number of significant changes to us patent law  including the transition from a first to invent system to a first to file system and changes to the way issued patents are challenged 
these changes may favor larger and more established companies that have more resources than we do to devote to patent application filing and prosecution 
the us patent and trademark office is currently developing regulations and procedures to administer the leahy smith act  and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the leahy smith act will not become effective until one year or months after its enactment 
accordingly  it is not clear what  if any  impact the leahy smith act will ultimately have on the cost of prosecuting our patent applications  our ability to obtain patents based on our discoveries and our ability to enforce or defend our issued patents 
however  it is possible that in order to adequately protect our patents under the first to file system  we will have to allocate significant additional resources  including on additional personnel  to the establishment and maintenance of a new patent application process designed to be more streamlined and competitive in the context of the new first to file system  which would divert valuable resources from other areas of our business 

table of contents in addition to pursuing patents on our technology  we have taken steps to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees  consultants  corporate partners and  when needed  our advisors 
such agreements may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of the agreements  and we may not be able to prevent such unauthorized disclosure 
monitoring unauthorized disclosure is difficult  and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to prevent such disclosure are  or will be  adequate 
in the event a competitor infringes upon our patent or other intellectual property rights  litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend our patents against challenge  even if successful  could be expensive and time consuming and could require significant time and attention from our management 
we may not have sufficient resources to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend our patents against challenges from others 
the medical device industry is characterized by patent and other intellectual property litigation  and we could become subject to litigation that could be costly  result in the diversion of our management s time and efforts  require us to pay damages or prevent us from selling our products 
the medical device industry is characterized by extensive litigation and administrative proceedings over patent and other intellectual property rights 
whether or not a product infringes a patent involves complex legal and factual issues  the determination of which is often uncertain 
our competitors may assert that they own us or foreign patents containing claims that cover our products  their components or the methods we employ in the manufacture or use of our products 
for example  we are currently involved with st 
jude in patent litigation regarding each party s pressure guide wire products and whether these products infringe the patents of the other party 
because patent applications can take many years to issue and in many instances at least months to publish  there may be applications now pending of which we are unaware  which may later result in issued patents that contain claims that cover our products 
there could also be existing patents  of which we are unaware  that contain claims that cover one or more components of our products 
as the number of participants in our industry increases  the possibility of patent infringement claims against us also increases 
any interference proceeding  litigation or other assertion of claims against us  including our current patent litigation with st 
jude medical  may cause us to incur substantial costs  could place a significant strain on our financial resources  divert the attention of our management from our core business and harm our reputation 
if the relevant patents asserted against us were upheld as valid and enforceable and were found to be infringed  we could be required to pay substantial damages and or royalties and could be prevented from selling our products unless we could obtain a license or were able to redesign our products to avoid infringement 
any such license may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all 
if we fail to obtain any required licenses or make any necessary changes to our products or technologies  we may be unable to make  use  sell or otherwise commercialize one or more of our products in the affected country 
in addition  if we are found to infringe willfully  we could be required to pay treble damages and attorney fees  among other penalties 
we expect to enter new product fields in the future 
entering such additional fields may subject us to claims of infringement 
defending any infringement claims would be expensive and time consuming 
we are aware of certain third party us patents in fields that we are targeting for development 
we do not have licenses to these patents nor do we believe that such licenses are required to develop  commercialize or sell our products in these areas 
however  the owners of these patents may initiate a lawsuit alleging infringement of one or more of these or other patents 
if they do  we may be required to incur substantial costs related to patent litigation  which could place a significant strain on our financial resources and divert the attention of management from our business and harm our reputation 
adverse determinations in such litigation could cause us to redesign or prevent us from manufacturing or selling our products in these areas  which would have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to generate revenues through the sale of these products 

table of contents from time to time in the ordinary course of business  we receive letters from third parties advising us of third party patents that may relate to our business 
the letters do not explicitly seek any particular action or relief from us 
although these letters do not threaten legal action  these letters may be deemed to put us on notice that continued operation of our business might infringe intellectual property rights of third parties 
we do not believe we are infringing any such third party rights  and we are unaware of any litigation or other proceedings having been commenced against us asserting such infringement 
we cannot assure you that such litigation or other proceedings may not be commenced against us in the future 
our rights to a worldwide license of certain ivus patents owned or licensed by boston scientific may be challenged 
the marketing and sale of our current rotational ivus catheters and pullback products depend on a license for ivus related patents owned or licensed by boston scientific 
boston scientific was required to transfer the related intellectual property rights pursuant to a order of the federal trade commission 
we obtained rights to the license in through our former wholly owned subsidiary  pacific rim medical ventures  which merged into us on december  in the event boston scientific disputes our rights to the license or seeks to terminate the license  we may be required to expend significant time and resources defending our rights 
an adverse determination could cause us to redesign or prevent us from manufacturing or selling our rotational ivus catheters and pullback products  which would have an adverse effect on our business 
additionally  in the event that the chain of title from the transfer of rights from boston scientific through the transfer to us is successfully challenged  we may have fewer rights to the technology than our business requires which will negatively impact our ability to continue our development of rotational ivus catheters and pullback products or subject us to disputes with boston scientific or others with respect to the incorporation of this intellectual property into our products 
our vh ivus business depends on a license from the cleveland clinic foundation  the loss of which would severely impact our business 
the marketing and sale of our vh ivus functionality for ivus depends on an exclusive license to patents owned by the cleveland clinic foundation  the license to which we obtained in april we are aware that maintenance of the license depends upon certain provisions being met by us including payment of royalties  commercialization of the licensed technology and obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals 
if the cleveland clinic foundation were to claim that we committed a material breach or default of these provisions and we were not able to cure such breach or default  the cleveland clinic foundation would have a right to terminate the agreement 
the loss of the rights granted under the agreement could require us to redesign our vh ivus functionality or prevent us from manufacturing or selling our ivus products containing vh ivus in countries covered by these patents 
in addition  our exclusive license shall become non exclusive if we fail to obtain regulatory clearances or approvals to commercialize the licensed technology within a proscribed time period 
the cost of redesigning or an inability to sell our vh ivus products would have a negative impact on our ability to grow our business and achieve our expected revenues 
risks related to our common stock we expect that the price of our common stock will fluctuate substantially 
the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuation 
factors that could cause volatility in the market price of our common stock include the following changes in earnings estimates  investors perceptions  recommendations by securities analysts or our failure to achieve analysts earnings estimates  quarterly variations in our or our competitors results of operations  changes in governmental regulations or in the status of our regulatory clearance or approvals  changes in availability of third party reimbursement in the us or other countries  the announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  
table of contents the announcement of an acquisition or other business combination or strategic transaction  possible sales of our common stock by investors who view the notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in us  the conversion of some or all of the notes and any sales in the public market of shares of our common stock issued upon conversion of the notes  hedging or arbitrage trading activity that may develop involving our common stock  including in connection with the convertible note hedge transaction and warrant transaction we entered into in connection with the notes offering and arbitrage strategies employed or that may be employed by investors in the notes  announcements related to patents issued to us or our competitors  the announcement of pending or threatened litigation and developments in litigation involving us  sales of large blocks of our common stock  including sales by our executive officers and directors  and general market and economic conditions and other factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors 
these factors may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
additional equity issuances or a sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
if our existing stockholders sell a substantial number of shares of our common stock or the public market perceives that existing stockholders might sell shares of our common stock  the market price of our common stock could decline 
in addition  sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate 
because we may need to raise additional capital in the future to continue to expand our business and develop new products  we may  among other things  conduct additional equity offerings 
these future equity issuances  together with any additional shares of our common stock issued or issuable in connection with past or any future acquisitions  would result in further dilution to investors and could depress the market price of our common stock 
no prediction can be made regarding the number of shares of our common stock that may be issued or the effect that the future sales of shares of our common stock will have on the market price of our shares 
our directors  officers and principal stockholders have significant voting power and may take actions that may not be in the best interests of our other stockholders 
as of february   our directors  officers and principal stockholders those holding more than of our common stock collectively controlled a significant portion of our outstanding common stock 
to the extent our directors  officers and principal stockholders continue to hold a significant portion of our outstanding common stock  these stockholders  if they act together  would be able to exert significant influence over the management and affairs of our company and most matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control  might adversely affect the market price of our common stock and may not be in the best interests of our other stockholders 
anti takeover provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and other agreements and in delaware law could discourage a takeover 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that might enable our management to resist a takeover 
these provisions include a classified board of directors  
table of contents advance notice requirements to stockholders for matters to be brought at stockholder meetings  a supermajority stockholder vote requirement for amending certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws  and the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval  which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer 
we are also subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law that  in general  prohibit any business combination or merger with a beneficial owner of or more of our common stock unless the holder s acquisition of our stock was approved in advance by our board of directors 
these provisions might discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of our company or a change in our management 
the existence of these provisions could adversely affect the voting power of holders of common stock and limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
we have adopted a stockholder rights plan that may discourage  delay or prevent a change of control and make any future unsolicited acquisition attempt more difficult 
under the rights plan the rights will become exercisable only upon the occurrence of certain events specified in the plan  including the acquisition of of our outstanding common stock by a person or group  with limited exceptions  each right will entitle the holder  other than an acquiring person  to acquire shares of our common stock at a discount to the then prevailing market price  our board of directors may redeem outstanding rights at any time prior to a person becoming an acquiring person at a minimal price per right  and prior to a person becoming an acquiring person  the terms of the rights may be amended by our board of directors without the approval of the holders of the rights 
in addition  the terms of our notes may require us to purchase these notes for cash in the event of a takeover of our company 
the indenture governing the notes also prohibits us from engaging in certain mergers or acquisitions unless  among other things  the surviving entity assumes our obligations under the notes 
these and other provisions applicable to the notes may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of our company that would otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders 
we have not paid dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends in the future 
we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock 
we currently intend to retain all future earnings for the operation and expansion of our business and  therefore  do not anticipate declaring or paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
the payment of dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our results of operations  capital requirements  financial condition  prospects  contractual arrangements  any limitations on payments of dividends present in our current and future debt agreements  and other factors our board of directors may deem relevant 
if we do not pay dividends  a return on our common stock will only occur if our stock price appreciates

overview we design  develop  manufacture and commercialize a broad suite of precision guided therapy products including intravascular ultrasound  or ivus  and fractional flow reserve  or ffr  products 
we believe that these products enhance the diagnosis and treatment of vascular heart disease by improving the efficiency and efficacy of existing percutaneous interventional  or pci  therapy procedures in the coronary or peripheral arteries 
we are facilitating the adoption of functional pci  in which our ffr technology is used to determine whether or not a stent is necessary  and ivus is used to guide stent placement and optimization 
we market our products to physicians and technicians who perform pci procedures in hospitals and to other personnel who make purchasing decisions on behalf of hospitals 
our products consist of multi modality consoles which are marketed as stand alone units or as customized units that can be integrated into a variety of hospital based interventional surgical suites called catheterization laboratories  or cath labs 
we have developed customized cath lab versions of these consoles and are developing additional functionality options as part of our cath lab integration initiative 
our consoles have been designed to serve as a multi modality platform for our phased array and rotational ivus catheters  ffr pressure wires  image guided therapy catheters and medtronic s pioneer reentry device 
our ivus products include single procedure disposable phased array and rotational ivus imaging catheters and additional functionality options such as virtual histology  or vh  ivus tissue characterization and chromaflo stent apposition analysis 
our ffr offerings can be accessed through our multi modality platforms  and we also provide ffr only consoles 
our ffr disposables are single procedure disposable pressure and flow guide wires used to measure the pressure and flow characteristics of blood around plaque enabling physicians to gauge the plaque s physiological impact on blood flow and pressure 
we are developing additional offerings for integration into the platform  including adenosine free instant wave free ratio ffr  or ifr  forward looking ivus  or fl 
ivus  catheters  focal acoustic computed tomography catheters and ultra high resolution optical coherence tomography  or oct  systems and catheters 
through axsun technologies  inc  or axsun  one of our wholly owned subsidiaries  we also develop and manufacture optical monitors for the telecommunication industry  laser and non laser light sources  and optical engines used in the medical oct imaging systems and advanced photonic components and sub systems used in spectroscopy and other industrial applications 
we believe axsun s proprietary oct technology will provide us competitive advantages in the invasive imaging sector 
we have corporate infrastructure in the us  europe and japan 
our corporate office is located in san diego  california 
our worldwide manufacturing and research and development operations are located in rancho cordova  california 
we also have additional research and development facilities in cleveland  ohio  forsyth county  georgia and san diego  california 
we have sales offices in alpharetta  georgia and tokyo  japan  sales and distribution offices in zaventem  belgium and woodmead  south africa  and third party distribution facilities in tokyo  japan 
in addition  we have facilities in billerica  massachusetts for the manufacturing and operations of axsun  our wholly owned subsidiary  and the research and development of oct and fl 
ivus technology 
during the first half of  we completed our restructuring plan to close our facility in san antonio  texas and consolidated our oct resources into our billerica  massachusetts facility 
we are currently in the process of constructing a manufacturing facility in costa rica and expect to begin commercial manufacturing activities there in at december   we had  full time employees worldwide  including manufacturing employees  sales and marketing employees and research and development employees 
we have focused on building our domestic and international sales and marketing infrastructure to market our products to physicians and technicians who perform pci procedures in hospitals and to other personnel who 
table of contents make purchasing decisions on behalf of hospitals 
we sell our products directly to customers in the us  certain european markets and south africa 
during the third quarter of  we transitioned our business from selling our products primarily through distributors to selling our products directly to customers in japan 
we utilize distributors in other geographic areas 
our distributors are involved in product launch planning  education and training  physician support and clinical trial management 
at december   we had a worldwide installed base of over  consoles 
we intend to grow and leverage this installed base to drive recurring sales of our single procedure disposable catheters and guide wires 
in the year ended december   the sale of our single procedure disposable catheters and guide wires accounted for million  or of our medical segment revenues  a million  or increase from  in which the sale of our single procedure disposable catheters and guide wires accounted for million  or of our medical segment revenues 
we manufacture our multi modality and ffr consoles  ivus catheters and ffr guide wires at our facility in rancho cordova  california 
we use third party manufacturing partners to produce circuit boards and mechanical sub assemblies used in the manufacture of our consoles 
we also use third party manufacturing partners for certain proprietary components used in the manufacture of our single procedure disposable products 
we perform incoming inspection on these circuit boards  mechanical sub assemblies and components  assemble them into finished products  and test the final product to assure quality control 
our revenues have increased from million in to million in and to million in our operating loss was million in  which included an million charge related to in process research and development  or ipr d  for a milestone payment related to the cardiospectra acquisition and a million charge related to the accrual of a milestone payment related to the novelis acquisition 
in we had operating income of million  which included a reversal of the million charge related to the novelis milestone  as we believed we would no longer achieve the milestone 
our operating results also included million in expenses resulting from the judgment related to our ongoing lightlab litigation discussed in more detail in note commitments and other contractual obligations litigation lightlab to our consolidated financial statements 
since our inception  is the first full fiscal year in which profitability was achieved 
in we had operating income of million  and this is the second full fiscal year we achieved profitability 
in the years ended december   and    and  respectively  of our revenues and   and  respectively  of our operating expenses were denominated in various non us dollar currencies  primarily the euro and the japanese yen 
we expect that a significant portion of our revenue and operating expenses will continue to be denominated in non us dollar currencies 
as a result  we are subject to risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  which could affect our operating results in the future 
since our yen denominated sales exceeds our yen denominated costs  whenever the us dollar strengthens relative to the yen  there is an adverse effect on our results of operations 
conversely  whenever the us dollar weakens relative to the yen  there is a positive effect on our results of operations 
on the contrary  because our euro denominated costs exceeds our euro denominated sales  whenever the us dollar strengthens relative to the euro  there is a positive effect on our results of operations 
conversely  whenever the us dollar weakens relative to the euro  there is an adverse effect on our results of operations 
for example  the average exchange rate of one us dollar to yen decreased from in to in  which resulted in a net positive impact to our operational results in the amount of approximately million 
the average exchange rate of one euro to us dollar increased from in to in  which resulted in a net positive impact to our operational results in the amount of approximately million 
the economic conditions in many countries and regions where we generate our revenues remain uncertain 
if our customers do not obtain or do not have access to the necessary capital to operate their businesses  or are otherwise adversely affected by any deterioration in national and worldwide economic conditions  this could result in reductions in the sales of our products  longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies by 
table of contents our customers  which would materially and adversely affect our business 
in addition  our customers and suppliers liquidity  capital resources and credit may be adversely affected by their relative ability or inability to obtain capital and credit  which could adversely affect our ability to collect on our outstanding invoices and lengthen our collection cycles  or limit our timely access to important sources of raw materials necessary for the manufacture of our consoles and catheters 
in addition  the political unrest in the middle east may have adverse consequences to the global economy or to our customers in the middle east  which could negatively impact our business 
the challenging global economic conditions have also led to concerns over the solvency of certain european union member states  including greece  ireland  italy  portugal and spain 
uncertainty about future economic conditions may make it more difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments 
for further discussion  see risk factors general national and worldwide economic conditions may materially and adversely affect our financial performance and results of operations 
financial operations overview the following is a description of the primary components of our revenue and expenses 
revenues 
we derive our revenues from two reporting segments medical and industrial 
our medical segment represents our core business  in which we derive revenues primarily from the sale of our consoles and single procedure disposables 
our industrial segment derives revenues related to the sales of axsun s micro optical spectrometers and optical channel monitors to telecommunication and other industrial companies 
in the year ended december   we generated million of revenues which is composed of million from our medical segment and million from our industrial segment 
we experienced increases in revenues related to ivus and ffr single procedure disposables and ffr consoles in compared with  while ivus console sales remained relatively flat year over year 
in the year ended december   of our medical segment revenues were derived from the sale of our consoles  as compared with in the year ended december  in the year ended december   ivus single procedure disposables accounted for of our medical segment revenues  compared to in  while in the year ended december   of our medical segment revenues were derived from the sale of our ffr single procedure disposables  as compared with in the year ended december  other revenues consist primarily of service and maintenance revenues  shipping and handling revenues  sales of distributed products  spare parts sales  and license fees 
we expect to continue to experience variability in our quarterly revenues from console sales due in part to the timing of hospital capital equipment purchasing decisions 
further  we expect variability of our revenues based on the timing of our new product introductions  which may cause our customers to delay their purchasing decisions until the new products are commercially available 
we may include in our arrangements with customers future deliverables  such as unspecified hardware upgrades or biomedical equipment education 
in these cases  we may be required to defer the allocated arrangement consideration based on the relative estimated selling prices of the undelivered items until all our obligations have been met 
our medical segment sales in the us are generated by our direct sales representatives and our products are shipped to hospitals throughout the us from our facilities in rancho cordova  california and billerica  massachusetts 
our medical segment international sales are generated by our direct sales representatives or through independent distributors and are shipped throughout the world from our facilities in rancho cordova  california  billerica  massachusetts  zaventem  belgium  tokyo  japan  and woodmead  south africa 
our industrial segment sales are generated by our direct sales representatives or through independent distributors and these products are shipped primarily to telecommunications and industrial companies domestically and abroad from our facility in billerica  massachusetts 

table of contents cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists primarily of material costs for the products that we sell and other costs associated with our manufacturing process  such as personnel costs  rent  depreciation related to our manufacturing equipment and utilities 
in addition  cost of revenues includes depreciation of company owned consoles  royalty expenses for licensed technologies included in our products  service costs  provisions for warranty  distribution  freight and packaging costs and stock based compensation expense related to manufacturing employees 
we expect a trend of further improvement in our gross margin for ivus and ffr products if we are successful in our ongoing efforts to streamline and improve our manufacturing processes  increase production volumes and transition certain manufacturing operations to costa rica 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel serving the sales  administrative and marketing functions 
other costs include stock based compensation expense  professional fees for legal and accounting service  travel and entertainment expenses  facility costs  trade show  training and other promotional expenses 
due to ongoing litigation  legal expenses tend to be somewhat unpredictable in their timing and amount 
we expect that our selling  general and administrative expenses will increase as we continue to expand our sales force and marketing efforts and invest in the necessary infrastructure to support our continued growth 
we expect these expenses to grow at a slower rate than our revenues as we plan to leverage these costs as we continue to grow our business 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  consultants  prototype materials  clinical studies  depreciation  regulatory filing fees  certain legal costs related to our intellectual property and stock based compensation expense 
we expense research and development costs as incurred 
due to product development timelines  research and development costs tend to be distributed unevenly between the periods 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase as we continue to develop our products and technologies 
amortization of intangibles 
we amortize intangible assets  consisting of our developed technology  licenses  customer relationships  assembled workforce  patents and trademarks  using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives of up to years 
these assets are regularly tested for impairment and abandonment 
in process research and development 
ipr d consists of our projects acquired in connection with acquisitions that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses as of each acquisition date 
certain additional payments that may be required in connection with our acquisitions could result in future charges to ipr d 
in december  we acquired certain oct assets in connection with our acquisition of cardiospectra  inc  or cardiospectra  which were valued at million 
in vivo testing and regulatory approval remained to be completed as of the acquisition date at an estimated cost of million 
in december  we achieved a milestone specified in the cardiospectra merger agreement and million became payable by us to the former stockholders of cardiospectra 
we paid such amount to the former stockholders of cardiospectra with the issuance of  shares of our common stock and  of cash in january the second milestone specified in the merger agreement was not achieved as of december   and as such was not paid 
although we have received ce mark approval for a preliminary version of our oct product  this version is not intended to be commercialized 
we believe there are significant incremental efforts and costs that must be incurred to complete a product that is suitable for commercialization and there is significant risk that a commercializable product may not result from our efforts 
as of december   we estimate that we will incur million of additional costs in order to obtain a commercializable oct product for a total of approximately million 
due to uncertainties in our oct development program  we are currently unable to predict when we will launch our oct product 
additional milestone payments of up to million may be paid to the former stockholders of cardiospectra upon achievement of the respective revenue targets described in the merger agreement see note acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements 
if we are unable to launch an oct product in a timely manner  or at all  such as if we experience delays associated with significant design changes that result from unsuccessful human trials or discoveries during 
table of contents human trials  we may jeopardize a potential competitive position  experience difficulties in obtaining our forecasted revenues and associated market share and we may not be required to pay some or all of the remaining milestone payments 
in may  we acquired the fl 
ivus project in connection with our acquisition of novelis  which was valued at million 
under the terms of the merger agreement  a milestone payment of million was eligible to be earned by the novelis stockholders upon receipt of fda approval of a k application relating to the novelis fl 
ivus device only in the event that the original k application for such a device was filed with the fda on or before december  at december   a k application had been made to the fda 
at that time  we believed that the k application would be approved and that the milestone would become payable 
accordingly  at december  we recorded an accrual for million in relation to the potential milestone payment 
based on our internal assessments in relation to our ongoing interactions with the fda regarding this k application  during the fourth quarter of it became apparent that our original k application would not be approved prior to its expiration 
accordingly  we reversed the accrual for the milestone payment  resulting in a million credit to ipr d expense during the fourth quarter of we believe there are significant incremental efforts and costs that must be incurred to complete a product that is suitable for commercialization 
as of december   we estimate that we will incur million of additional costs in order to commercialize the first product using fl 
ivus for a total of million 
we originally expected the fl 
ivus project to receive regulatory approvals and be commercialized during as of december   the project was expected to be completed in if the fl 
ivus project is not completed in a timely manner  such as if we experience delays associated with significant design changes that result from unsuccessful human trials or discoveries during human trials  we may jeopardize our competitive position and experience a potential loss of revenues and associated market share 
in august we acquired the forward looking intra cardiac echo  or fl 
ice  project in connection with our acquisition of fluid medical inc  or fluid medical 
this project was recorded as an intangible asset and was valued at million 
at the date of acquisition the estimated costs to complete were million 
at december   the estimated costs to complete are approximately million for a total of million 
as of december   the fl 
ice project was expected to be completed in the following table summarizes our significant ipr d projects in millions as of acquisition date costs incurred since acquisition estimated cost to complete  as of december  total estimated costs to complete since acquisition date project name fair value estimated cost to complete oct fl

ice interest income 
interest income is comprised of interest income earned from our cash and cash equivalents and our short term and long term available for sale investments 
interest expense 
interest expense is comprised of interest expense related to our convertible debt including coupon interest  accretion of debt discount  and amortization of issuance costs  interest expense on the final judgment in our massachusetts litigation see note commitments and contingencies litigation to our consolidated financial statements and interest expense related to our capital lease obligations 
exchange rate gain loss 
exchange rate gain loss is comprised of foreign currency transaction and remeasurement gains and losses  and the effect of changes in value and net settlements of our foreign exchange forward contracts 

table of contents provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate is a blended rate resulting from the composition of taxable income in the global jurisdictions in which we conduct business 
we apply the with and without method direct effects only  in accordance with authoritative guidance  with respect to recognition of stock option excess tax benefits within stockholders equity additional paid in capital 
therefore  provision for domestic income taxes is determined utilizing projected federal and state taxable income before the application of deductible excess tax benefits attributable to stock option exercises 
for the years ended december   and  the provision for income taxes is comprised of federal  foreign and various state and local income taxes 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
during the fourth quarter of  we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize the benefit of a significant portion of our deferred tax assets in the future 
we based this conclusion on historical and projected operating performance  as well as our expectation that our operations will generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize the tax benefit associated with the related deferred tax assets 
as a result  we released million of the valuation allowance on our net federal and state deferred tax assets

comparison of years ended december  and revenues 
overall  the increase in the medical segment revenue in the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  were driven by increased demand for our disposables  as well as higher revenues resulting from our direct sales efforts in japan and favorable impacts of foreign exchange rates related to the yen and euro 
additionally  the increases in ffr disposable revenues were primarily due to the broader availability of ffr technology as this functionality has been incorporated into our multi modality console  and in conjunction with an increased adoption of the technology based on clinical study data 
the revenue increases related to our consoles resulted from increased sales of console units  especially the ffr consoles which achieved increased penetration into the market during the decrease in industrial segment revenues results from lower sales to our international telecommunication customers due to the telecommunications industry s cyclical nature 
the increase in other revenues is primarily due to higher sales of third party products and higher service contract and rental revenues 
we recognized increases in revenues across all our key geographic markets 
the japanese market s growth is due to the continued success of our direct sales efforts and the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange related to the yen 
the decrease in the rest of the world primarily relates to the decline in our industrial segment revenues to customers in china 

table of contents cost of revenues 
the increase in the cost of revenues in the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  was primarily due to higher sales volume 
gross margin was of revenues in the year ended december   up from of revenues in the year ended december  this favorable gross margin was primarily the result of a decrease in the production costs of ivus and ffr disposable products due to favorable product mix  and ongoing cost reduction initiatives  a decline in lower margin axsun industrial sales  and favorable impacts of foreign currency exchange rates to the gross margin related to the yen and euro 
these benefits were partially offset by increased depreciation costs from additions of company owned consoles 
selling  general and administrative 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  was primarily due to increased headcount resulting from the expansion of our us  japan and europe sales organizations  including continued growth in our japan operation to support our direct sales efforts there  expansion of our costa rica general and administrative activities during the pre production phase  unfavorable impacts of foreign currency exchange rates related to the yen and euro  increased information technology and infrastructure expenses to support company growth  and legal expenses related to our litigation matters 
in addition  during the year ended december   we recorded a judgment of million  which is discussed in more detail in note commitments and other contractual obligations litigation lightlab to our consolidated financial statement 
research and development 
the increase in research and development expenses in the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  was primarily due to increased spending on various product development projects  increased clinical expenses  mainly related to the verdict and first clinical programs  and activities supporting other acquired technologies 
amortization of intangibles 
the increase in amortization expense in the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  is primarily due to the addition of intangible assets and related to the amortization of the customer relationship intangibles we acquired upon the termination of a distributor relationship in november in process research and development 
there was no ipr d expense recorded in the year ended december  during  we recorded  of ipr d expense related to the milestone achieved under the oct program offset by a million reversal of an accrual for a milestone payment of million recognized in related to our fl 
ivus project acquired from novelis as we believed we would no longer achieve the milestone 
interest income 
the increase in interest income was primarily due to a significant increase in our investment balances during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   resulting from the proceeds of our convertible debt offering which commenced on september  and favorable cash flows from operations 
interest expense

during the year ended december  and the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates was somewhat mitigated by our hedging practices 
through our hedging program we reduce the volatility of our exchange rate gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of our intercompany receivable balances at current exchange rates 
provision for income taxes 
during the quarter ended december   we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize the benefit of a significant portion of our deferred tax assets in the future 
therefore  we reversed million of the valuation allowance on the company s net federal and certain state deferred income tax assets 
stock option excess tax benefits of  and  were credited to additional paid in capital during the year ended december  and  respectively 
the reversal of the valuation allowance related to convertible senior notes of million was credited to additional paid in capital during the year ended december  
table of contents comparison of years ended december  and revenues 
overall  the increase in our medical segment revenue were driven by increased demand for our disposables  as well as higher revenues resulting from our direct sales efforts in japan

the increase in the revenues related to console sales in the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  was based on an increase in console unit sales 
the increase in the industrial segment resulted from higher sales to our international telecommunications customers 
the increase in other revenues is due primarily to higher service contract and rental revenues  partially offset by lower sales of distributed products 
increases in revenues were realized across all our key geographic markets 
cost of revenues 
the increase in the cost of revenues during the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  was primarily due to higher sales volume 
gross margin was of revenues in the year ended december   up from of revenues in the year ended december  this gross margin improvement was primarily the result of favorable pricing from our transition to the direct sales model in japan  a decrease in the production costs of ivus and ffr disposable products due to ongoing cost reduction initiatives  increased overhead recovery rates due to higher volumes  and lower warranty related costs 
these benefits were partially offset by increased depreciation costs from our console unit placement pool additions 
selling  general and administrative 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses during the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  was primarily due to increased headcount resulting from the expansion of our us  europe and japan sales organizations  including continued growth in our japan operation to support our direct sales efforts there  legal expenses related to our litigation matters  including the lightlab litigation and associated judgment of million which is discussed in more detail in note commitments and other contractual obligations litigation lightlab to our consolidated financial statements  increased infrastructure expenses to support company growth  higher stock based compensation expense  increased marketing expenses related to new product launches  and severance payments related to the resignation of two senior executives 
research and development 
the increase in research and development expenses in the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  was primarily due to increased spending on various new and existing product development projects  including oct and fl 
ivus and activities supporting other acquired technologies  and increased clinical and regulatory expenses 
amortization of intangibles 
the decrease in amortization expense in the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  was primarily related to developed technology that we originally acquired from jomed  nv that was fully amortized as of december  partially offset by amortization expense related to developed technology acquired in february in process research and development 
ipr d expenses were a reduction of expenses of million in the year ended december  this primarily resulted from the reversal of an accrual for a milestone payment of million recognized in related to our fl 
ivus project acquired from novelis as we believed we would no longer achieve the milestone 
ipr d expenses were million in the year ended december  of this amount  million related to a milestone payment for our oct project acquired from cardiospectra and million related to the accrual of a milestone payment for our fl 
ivus project acquired from novelis 
interest income 
the decrease in interest income in the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  was primarily due to a decrease in the weighted average yield earned on our investments 

table of contents interest expense 
the increase in interest expense was primarily due to our convertible debt financing which was completed in september interest expense during the year ended december  related to our convertible debt including coupon interest  accretion of debt discount  and amortization of debt issuance costs and interest expense on our capital lease obligations  while in the year ended december  interest expense was entirely related to our capital lease obligations 
exchange rate gain loss 
the exchange rate gain in the year ended december  was primarily related to the weakening of the us dollar compared to the yen and the related effect on the valuation of euro based monetary assets and liabilities held by volcano europe bvba  or volcano europe 
in october  approximately million of intercompany receivable amounts owed to volcano corporation from volcano japan co 
ltd  or volcano japan  were converted to long term investment  resulting in a decrease in the amount of yen based receivables being marked to market 
in addition  in october  we implemented a hedging program to mitigate the volatility of our exchange rate gains and losses resulting from the translation of our intercompany receivable balances at current exchange rates 
during the year ended december   the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates was significantly reduced through our hedging practices 
provision for income taxes

cash used in operating activities of million for reflected our net loss of million and non cash investment amortization of  in addition  uses of cash include increases in accounts receivable and inventories of million and million  respectively  and a decrease of accounts payable of million 
the increase in accounts receivable is due to the increased sales volume and timing of cash receipts  the increase in inventory is due to anticipated increased sales volume and the decrease in accounts payable is primarily due to the timing of disbursements 
these amounts were offset by benefits realized from non cash expenses consisting of in process research and development expense of million related to milestones of the cardiospectra and novelis acquisitions  depreciation and amortization of million and non cash stock compensation expense of million 
in addition  sources of cash include an increase in accrued compensation of million  primarily due to increased headcount and related accrued benefits  and an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of million primarily related to accrued commissions to goodman and accrued legal costs for the lightlab litigation

future liquidity needs our primary short term needs for capital  which are subject to change  include expenditures related to medical diagnostic equipment that we own and place at our customers premises  our facilities expansion needs  including costs of constructing a new manufacturing facility  acquiring or leasing additional facilities and associated building costs or tenant improvements  the acquisition of equipment and other fixed assets for use in our current and future manufacturing and research and development facilities  upgrades to our information technology infrastructure to enhance our capabilities and improve overall productivity  support of our commercialization efforts related to our current and future products  including expansion of our direct sales force and field support resources in the us and abroad  particularly in japan where our strategy is to continue to pursue a direct sales model  the continued advancement of research and development activities  improvements to and increases in our manufacturing capacity and efficiency  and acquisitions of technologies that enhance our capabilities or complement our markets 

table of contents our capital expenditures are largely discretionary and within our control 
we expect that our product revenue and the resulting operating income  as well as the status of each of our product development programs  will significantly impact our cash management decisions 
at december   we believe our current cash and cash equivalents and our available for sale investments will be sufficient to fund working capital requirements  capital expenditures including the expansion of our manufacturing operations into costa rica and the implementation of a new enterprise resource management system  and operations for at least the next months 
we intend to retain any future earnings to support operations and to finance the growth and development of our business  and we do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will be influenced by numerous factors  including the extent and duration of any future operating losses  the level and timing of future sales and expenditures  the results and scope of ongoing research and product development programs  working capital required to support our sales growth  funds required to service our debt  the receipt of and time required to obtain regulatory clearances and approvals  our sales and marketing programs  our need for infrastructure to support our sales growth  the continuing acceptance of our products in the marketplace  competing technologies and changes in the market and regulatory environment and cash that may be required to settle our foreign currency hedges 
our ability to fund our longer term cash needs is subject to various risks  many of which are beyond our control see risk factors we may require significant additional capital to pursue our growth strategy  and our failure to raise capital when needed could prevent us from executing our growth strategy 
should we require additional funding  such as additional capital investments  we may need to raise the required additional funds through bank borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities 
we cannot assure that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us  if at all 
at december   we have federal and state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million and million  respectively  available to reduce future taxable income if we remain profitable 
pursuant to internal revenue code section  use of net operating loss carry forwards related to acquisitions of approximately million may be limited 
we expect to utilize our available net operating loss carry forwards to reduce future tax obligations in the event we are successful in maintaining continued profitability 
however  future limitations on our ability to use net operating loss carry forwards and other minimum state taxes may increase our overall tax obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements in conjunction with the sale of our products in the ordinary course of business  we provide standard indemnification to business partners and customers for losses suffered or incurred for patent  copyright or any other intellectual property infringement claims by any third parties with respect to our products 
the term of these indemnification arrangements is generally perpetual 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these agreements is unlimited 
at december   we have not incurred any costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification arrangements 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments that are not reflected in our balance sheet at december  for each of the periods indicated in thousands payment due by period total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations and commercial commitments capital lease obligations including interest operating lease obligations non cancelable purchase commitments convertible senior notes interest on convertible senior notes clinical programs commitments for construction of costa rica facility total we lease office space and have entered into other lease commitments in the us as well as locations in europe and asia 
operating lease obligations include future minimum lease payments under all our non cancelable operating leases at december  consists of non cancelable commitments primarily for the purchase of production materials and other inventory items 
we have commitments to provide funding of million to a clinical study conducted by a third party and at december   we have a remaining obligation of up to million 
we will be billed as services are performed under the agreement 
in addition  we have entered into agreements with other third parties to sponsor clinical studies 
generally  we contract with one or more clinical research sites for a single study and no one agreement is material to our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
we are usually billed as services are performed based on enrollment and are required to make payments over periods ranging from less than one year up to three years 
our actual payments under these agreements will vary based on enrollment 
at december   we estimate our contractual obligations related to these clinical studies are approximately million over the next two years 
the total above does not include milestone payments of up to an aggregate of million which may be due to the former shareholders of cardiospectra see note acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements upon the achievement of certain milestones and may  at our election  be payable in either cash or stock  and up to an estimated million in payments for clinical studies which are billed as services are performed see above 
critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
critical accounting policies are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
as the number of variables and assumptions affecting the possible future resolution of the uncertainties increase  those judgments become even more subjective and complex 
in order to provide an understanding about how our management forms its judgments about future events  including the variables and assumptions underlying the estimates  and the sensitivity of those judgments to different circumstances  we have identified our critical accounting policies below 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue from the sale of our products is generally recognized when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer  the terms of which are generally free on board shipping point 
we use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an arrangement 
we use shipping documents and third party proof of delivery to verify that title has transferred 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based upon the terms of the agreement associated with the transaction 
to determine whether collection is probable  we assess a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
we prospectively adopted financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards update asu  no 
 revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu  and asu no 
 software topic certain revenue arrangements that include software elements asu  on january  we have applied asu to our revenue arrangements containing multiple deliverables that were entered into or significantly modified on or after january  these deliverables can consist of consoles  options for the console  single procedure disposable products  among other items and are considered separate units of accounting 
we allocate arrangement consideration based on the relative selling prices of the separate units of accounting contained within an arrangement containing multiple deliverables 
selling prices are determined using fair value  when available  or our estimate of selling price when fair value is not available prior to the adoption of asu  we used the residual method to allocate the arrangement consideration when we had not established fair value of delivered items and deferred all arrangement consideration when fair value was not available for undelivered items 
typically  we recognize revenue for each unit of accounting upon delivery of the item and complete all obligations under an arrangement with multiple deliverables within one year 
all costs associated with the provision of service are recognized in cost of revenues as incurred 
amounts billed in excess of revenue recognized are included as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets 
we sell our products through direct sales representatives in the us and a combination of direct sales representatives and independent distributors in international markets 
sales to distributors are recorded when title and risk of loss transfer upon shipment generally fob shipping point 
no direct sales customers or distributors have price protection 
estimated returns  which are historically nominal  are recorded as an allowance for sales return and as a reduction in revenues 
fair value we record our investments at fair value 
at december   our cash and investments totaled million 
fasb asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  or asc  establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value see note financial statement details to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
each level of input represents varying degrees of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value 
valuations using level and inputs are generally based on price quotations and other observable inputs in active markets and do not require significant management judgment or estimation 
we utilize a third party pricing service to assist us in obtaining fair value pricing for these investments 
while pricing for these securities is based on proprietary models  the inputs used are based on observable market information  therefore we have classified our inputs as level and level we do not value any of our investments using level inputs 
we also record our foreign exchange forward contracts at fair value 
at december   the fair value of our foreign exchange forward contracts of  was included in prepaid and other current assets and  was included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
we classified these fair value inputs as level 
table of contents inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of first in  first out cost or market value 
inventory provisions are recorded for materials that have become obsolete or are no longer used in current production and for inventory that has a market value less than the carrying value in inventory 
we regularly monitor potential inventory excess  obsolescence and lower market values compared to standard costs and  when necessary  reduce the carrying amount of our inventory to its market value 
specific reserves are maintained to reduce the carrying value of inventory items on hand that we know may not be used in finished goods 
if our estimates for potential inventory losses prove to be too low  then our future earnings will be affected when the related additional inventory losses are recorded 
long lived assets our long lived assets consist of property and equipment and intangible assets 
equipment and capitalized software are carried at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which are generally three to ten years  and leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the improvements  which is generally between three and ten years 
the straight line method is used for depreciation and amortization 
intangible assets primarily consist of developed technology  customer relationships  licenses  patents and trademarks  which are amortized using the straight line method over periods ranging from three to years  representing the estimated useful lives of the assets 
we capitalize external legal costs and filing fees associated with obtaining patents on our new discoveries and amortize these costs using the straight line method over the legal life of the patent or the product s estimated useful life  up to years 
acquired intellectual property is recorded at cost and is amortized over its estimated useful life 
we believe the useful lives we assigned to these assets are reasonable 
the long lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
when evaluating long lived assets for potential impairment  we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges 
if the estimated future cash flows are less the carrying value of the asset  we calculate an impairment loss 
the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated fair value  which may be based on estimated future cash flows discounted and with interest charges 
the impairment loss calculation contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values  including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 
no impairment of long lived assets and identifiable intangibles was identified or recorded during the years ended december   or goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually as of october  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable 
we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level  which is at the operating segment level 
our goodwill is allocated entirely to our medical segment 
the impairment evaluation involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
fair value reflects the price a market participant would be willing to pay in a potential sale of the reporting unit 
if the fair value exceeds carrying value  then it is concluded that no goodwill impairment has occurred 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a second step is required to measure possible goodwill impairment loss 
in the second step  the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of all of the reporting unit s assets and liabilities other than goodwill in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill that results from the allocation is 
table of contents then compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference 
these analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation under the provisions of fasb asc topic  compensation stock compensation  or asc  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values on the grant date 
we estimate the fair value of stock based awards on the date of grant using the black scholes merton option pricing model  or black scholes model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods using the straight line method 
we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise our estimate in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
see note stockholders equity to our consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our equity compensation programs and the fair value assumptions used to determine our stock based compensation expense 
we have used the black scholes model to estimate fair value of our stock based awards which requires various judgmental assumptions including estimating stock price volatility  risk free interest rate  and expected option life 
if we had made different assumptions  the amount of our deferred stock based compensation  stock based compensation expense  gross margin  net income loss and net income loss per share amounts could have been significantly different 
we believe that we have used reasonable methodologies  approaches and assumptions to determine the fair value of our common stock and that deferred stock based compensation and related amortization were recorded properly for accounting purposes 
if any of the assumptions used change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
for example  we granted stock options for  shares of our common stock during the year ended december  using our assumptions  we calculated approximately million of stock compensation expense related to these awards that will generally be amortized over four years 
given a ten percent change in our volatility assumption  the value of these awards would have differed by approximately  given a one hundred basis point change in our risk free interest rate assumption  the value of these awards would have differed by approximately  given a one year change in our expected option life assumption  the value of these awards would have differed by approximately  in addition  given a one hundred basis point change in our weighted average forfeiture rate assumption  our stock compensation expense recorded in the year ended december  would have differed by approximately  income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with fasb asc topic  income taxes 
our deferred tax assets are determined by multiplying the differences between the financial reporting and tax reporting bases for assets and liabilities by the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax regulations 
the impact of an uncertain income tax position is recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
if the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
the realization of our deferred tax assets  which have a net carrying value of million at december   is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods and jurisdictions in which those temporary differences 
table of contents become deductible 
during the fourth quarter of  we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize the benefit of a significant portion of our deferred tax assets in the future 
we based this conclusion on historical and projected operating performance  as well as our expectation that our operations will generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize the tax benefit associated with the some of our deferred tax assets 
as a result  we released million of the valuation allowance on our net federal and state deferred tax assets 
we believe it is more likely than not that the benefit from a portion of our state tax credit carry forwards and foreign net operating loss carry forwards will not be realized 
in recognition of this risk  we will continue to provide a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets relating to these items 
we will continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset by evaluating both positive and negative evidence that may exist 
any adjustment to the net deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded in the income statement for the period that the adjustment is determined to be required 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb updated the accounting guidance relating to the test for potential impairment of goodwill that we are required to perform annually 
the updated guidance requires companies to perform the second step of the impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any  when it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists because the carrying amount of a reporting unit is zero or negative 
in considering whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  an entity shall evaluate whether there are adverse qualitative factors 
the updated guidance is effective for us beginning in fiscal year the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb amended the guidance regarding fair value measurement and disclosure 
the amended guidance clarifies the application of existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements 
the amendment is effective for us beginning in fiscal year the adoption of this amendment is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb amended requirements for the presentation of comprehensive income  to increase the prominence of other comprehensive income oci in financial statements 
companies will have the option to present the components of net income and comprehensive income in either one or two consecutive financial statements 
this amendment eliminates the option to present other comprehensive income in the statement of stockholders equity 
we adopted this amendment and presented comprehensive income in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss for the year ended december   and in this annual report on form k 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our historical results of operations  however  there can be no assurance that our business will not be materially affected by inflation in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of changes in the value of market risk sensitive instruments caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity prices 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our results of operations and cash flows 
in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to interest rate and foreign exchange risk 
fluctuations in interest rates and the rate of exchange between the us dollar and foreign currencies  primarily the euro and yen  could adversely affect our financial results 
we do not carry significant inventory of transducers  substrates or scanner subassemblies 
if we had to change suppliers  we expect that it would take six to months to identify appropriate suppliers  complete design work and undertake the necessary inspections and testing before the new transducers  substrates and subassemblies would be available 

table of contents interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk at december  is related to the investment of our excess cash into highly liquid financial investments as well as our convertible debt which has a fixed rate 
fixed rate investments and borrowings may have their fair market value adversely impacted from changes in interest rates 
at december   we held million in cash and cash equivalents and available for sale investments of which million consisted of highly liquid financial investments with original final maturities of one year or less and the remaining amount was long term available for sale investments with original final maturities over one year 
based upon our balance of cash and cash equivalents and investments  the impact of an increase or decrease in interest rates of basis points would cause a corresponding increase or decrease in our annual interest income of approximately  from these investments 
we invest in cash and cash equivalents and available for sale investments in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields consistent with our tolerance for investment risk 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments 
we do not hold mortgage backed securities 
due to the generally short term nature of the majority of our investments  we have assessed that there is no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from them 
foreign currency exchange risk we are exposed to foreign currency risk related primarily to our operations in europe and japan 
fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and foreign currencies  primarily the euro and the yen  could adversely affect our financial results 
during the year ended december   and of our revenues were denominated in the euro and yen  respectively  and and of our operating expenses were denominated in the euro and the yen  respectively 
since our yen denominated sales exceeds our yen denominated costs  whenever the us dollar strengthens relative to the yen  there is an adverse effect on our results of operations 
conversely  whenever the us dollar weakens relative to the yen  there is a positive effect on our results of operations 
on the contrary  because our euro denominated costs exceeds our euro denominated sales  whenever the us dollar strengthens relative to the euro  there is a positive effect on our results of operations 
conversely  whenever the us dollar weakens relative to the euro  there is an adverse effect on our results of operations 
for example  the average exchange rate of one us dollar to yen decreased from in to in  which resulted in a net positive impact to our operational results of million 
the average exchange rate of one euro to us dollar increased from in to in  which resulted in a net positive impact to our operational results of million 
exchange rate fluctuations resulting from the remeasurement of the inter company balances between volcano corporation  our us entity  and volcano japan  and volcano corporation and volcano europe  and other non us dollar denominated liabilities into non us dollars are recorded as foreign currency transaction gains or losses and are included in exchange rate gain in the consolidated statement of operations 
on october   approximately million of intercompany receivable owed to volcano corporation from volcano japan was converted into a long term investment  resulting in a decrease in the amount of yen based receivables being marked to market 
in april  million of intercompany receivable owed to volcano corporation from volcano europe was converted into equity  resulting in a decrease in the amount of euro based receivables being marked to market 
these conversions thereby reduce the impact of the exchange rate fluctuations in our consolidated statements of operations 
commencing october  we began using foreign exchange forward contracts to manage a portion of the foreign currency risk for foreign subsidiaries with monetary assets and liabilities denominated in the yen and the euro 
we only use derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates  we do not hold any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we primarily use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency 
table of contents exposures  and they generally have terms of one year or less 
realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of financial contracts used to hedge the exchange rate exposure of these monetary assets and liabilities are also included in the determination of net income  as these transactions have not been designated for hedge accounting treatment 
these contracts effectively fix the exchange rate at which these specific monetary assets and liabilities will be settled so that gains or losses on the forward contracts offset the losses or gains from changes in the value of the underlying monetary assets and liabilities 
these contracts contain net settlement features 
if we experience unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates  we may be required to use material amounts of cash to settle the transactions which may adversely affect the operating results that we report with respect to the corresponding period 
during the years ended december   and  we recorded exchange rate losses of million  million and an exchange rate gain of  respectively  related to our foreign exchange forward contracts 
we currently hold foreign exchange forward contracts with two counterparties 
the bank counterparties in these contracts exposes us to credit related losses in the event of their nonperformance 
however  to mitigate that risk  we only contract with counterparties who meet our minimum credit quality guidelines 
in addition  our exposure in the event of a default by our counterparty is limited to the changes in value of our hedged balances 
at december   we were in a net asset position with our counterparty for  market price sensitive instruments in order to reduce the potential equity dilution that would result upon conversion of the notes  we entered into convertible note hedge transactions the hedge entitling us to purchase up to million shares of our common stock at an initial stock price of per share  subject to adjustment 
upon conversion of the notes  the hedge is expected to reduce the equity dilution if the daily volume weighted average price per share of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the hedge 
we also entered into warrant transactions with the counterparties of the hedge entitling them to acquire up to million shares of our common stock  subject to adjustment  at an initial strike price of per share  subject to adjustment 
the warrant transactions could have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the price of our common stock during a given measurement period the quarter or year to date period at maturity of the warrants exceeds the strike price of the warrants 
in addition  non performance by the counterparties under the hedge would potentially expose us to dilution of our common stock to the extent our stock price exceeds the conversion price
