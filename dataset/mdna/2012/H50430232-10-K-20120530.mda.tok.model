the 
table of contents lifesize division maintains a separate marketing and sales organization  which sells lifesize products and services worldwide 
lifesize product development and product management organizations are separate  but coordinated with our peripherals business  particularly our webcam and video communications groups 
we sell our lifesize products and services to distributors  value added resellers  oems  and  occasionally  direct enterprise customers 
sales of lifesize products were of our net sales in the fiscal years ended march  and we seek to fulfill the increasing demand for interfaces between people and the expanding digital world across multiple platforms and user environments 
the interface evolves as platforms  user models and our target markets evolve 
as access to digital information has expanded  we have extended our focus to mobile devices  the digital home  and the enterprise as access points to the internet and the digital world 
all of these platforms require interfaces that are customized according to how the devices are used 
we believe that continued investment in product research and development is critical to creating the innovation required to strengthen our competitive advantage and to drive future sales growth 
we are committed to identifying and meeting current and future customer trends with new and improved product technologies  partnering with others where our strengths are complementary  as well as leveraging the value of the logitech and lifesize brands from a competitive  channel partner and consumer experience perspective 
we believe innovation and product quality are important to gaining market acceptance and maintaining market leadership 
we are developing new categories of products  such as tablet accessories  expanding in emerging retail markets  such as china  russia  india and latin america  increasing our presence in digital music  and entering new product arenas  such as hosted video conferencing as a service  and peripherals and services for uc unified communications 
as we do so  we are confronting new competitors  many of which have more experience in the categories or markets and have greater marketing resources and brand name recognition than we have 
in addition  because of the continuing convergence of the markets for computing devices and consumer electronics  we expect greater competition in the future from well established consumer electronics companies in our new categories as well as future ones we might enter 
many of these companies have greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources than we have 
our peripherals and video conferencing industries are intensely competitive 
the peripherals industry is characterized by platform evolution  short product life cycles  continual performance enhancements  and rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors in our retail markets  and price sensitivity in the oem market 
we experience aggressive price competition and other promotional activities from our primary competitors and from less established brands  including brands owned by some retail customers known as house brands  in response to declining consumer demand in both mature retail markets and oem markets 
we may also encounter more competition if any of our competitors in one or more categories decide to enter other categories in which we currently operate 
as we address the current and future market challenges we face  we are evaluating our current product portfolio and roadmap to align our resources  prioritize our investments  fill product gaps  and introduce more innovative  differentiated products 
from time to time  we may seek to partner with or acquire  when appropriate  companies that have products  personnel  and technologies that complement our strategic direction 
we continually review our product offerings and our strategic direction in light of our profitability targets  competitive conditions  changing consumer trends  and the evolving nature of the interface between the consumer and the digital world 

table of contents summary of financial results our total net sales for the fiscal year ended march  decreased compared with the fiscal year ended march  growth in our asia pacific region  led by china  was offset by sales declines in our americas and emea regions 
retail sales in fiscal year decreased and retail units increased compared with fiscal year our overall retail average selling price in fiscal year declined compared with fiscal year retail sales in our asia pacific region increased in fiscal year compared with fiscal year china continued to be the single biggest driver in the region  with sales up by in fiscal year retail sales in our americas region decreased by  due to lower sales from logitech revue and our google tv peripherals  which were impacted by the price drop implemented in our second fiscal quarter of and our exit from the product line  and weak performance in the digital home and video categories 
lackluster economic conditions in western europe and product gaps in our video and remotes product categories led to the decrease in emea retail sales of in fiscal year if foreign currency exchange rates had been the same in fiscal years and  the percentage changes in our constant dollar retail sales would have been an increase of in asia pacific  a decrease of in the americas  and a decrease of in emea 
oem sales decreased in fiscal year compared with fiscal year  and oem units sold increased  primarily due to increased pointing device sales 
sales of lifesize communications products  which were of total net sales in both fiscal years and  increased by in fiscal year compared with fiscal year our gross margin for fiscal year was compared with in the prior fiscal year  due to increased manufacturing and distribution costs  a million inventory valuation adjustment related to logitech revue and related peripherals  and an unfavorable shift in retail product mix towards products with lower average selling prices 
operating expenses for fiscal year were of net sales compared with in fiscal year the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to the expansion of lifesize  increased investment in areas of future growth opportunities  such as china  and new product development  offset by lower advertising  marketing  bonus and stock compensation expenses 
net income for the year ended march  was million  compared with net income of million in fiscal year the decline in net income was due to lower net sales  lower gross margin  and increased operating expenses 
trends in our business our sales of pc peripherals for use by consumers in the americas and europe have historically made up the large majority of our revenues 
we believe logitech s future sales growth will be determined by our ability to create innovative products across all digital platforms  and our ability to increase sales in emerging markets  digital music  products for enterprises  and lifesize video conferencing 
the increasing popularity of smaller  mobile computing devices such as tablets and smartphones with touch interfaces and the declining popularity of desktop pcs have rapidly changed the market and usage model for pc peripherals 
logitech has begun to offer peripherals and accessories to augment the use of mobile devices 
for example  consumers are optimizing their audio experiences on their tablets and smartphones with premium earphones and speakers that pair easily with their mobile devices 
and they are enhancing their tablet experience with a range of accessories and peripherals such as the logitech keyboard case that enable them to create  consume and share digital content more conveniently and comfortably 
however  consumer acceptance and demand for our products for tablets and other mobile devices is still developing 

table of contents in our traditional  mature markets  such as north america  western and nordic europe  japan  and australia  although the installed base of pc users is large  consumer demand for pcs and peripherals is slowing and potentially may decline in future years 
we believe there are continued growth opportunities for our pc peripherals outside the more mature markets of the americas and europe 
we have invested significantly in growing the number of our sales  marketing and administrative personnel in china  with the result that china was our third largest country in retail sales for fiscal year we are also expanding our presence and our sales in russia  india and latin america 
we believe these markets offer high potential for us  but growing and conducting business in these markets will continue to require significant investment and management focus  and our return on investment is not certain due to  among other things  the challenges presented by potentially entrenched local competition  higher credit risks  and other factors that affect consumer trends in ways which may be substantially different from our current major markets 
we believe that digital music  the seamless consumption of audio content on home and mobile devices  presents a significant and natural growth opportunity for logitech  based on our history of successful earphone  headset and speaker products 
today s consumers consider listening to music as a pervasive entertainment activity  fueled by the growth in smartphones  tablets  music services and internet radio 
logitech has a solid foundation of audio solutions to satisfy consumers needs for music consumption  including logitech ue earphones and speakers  and squeezebox wi fi music players 
as we have increased our focus on products for the consumption of digital music  we are encountering competitors with higher consumer recognition and retailer shelf space  which may challenge our success in the digital music arena 
we are also increasing our efforts on creating and selling products and services to enterprises 
we believe the preferences of employees increasingly drive companies choices in the information technologies they deploy to their employee base  and this consumerization of information technology has made the enterprise market open to embracing consumer technology and design 
while our lifesize division has extensive experience in developing and selling products for enterprises  we are still in the early stages of our enterprise market team s efforts for our productivity peripherals and related services 
growing our enterprise business will continue to require investment in creation of business specific products  targeted product marketing  and sales channel development 
our video conferencing segment represented of our net sales for the fiscal years ended march  and the trend among businesses and institutions to use video conferencing offers a key growth opportunity for logitech 
however  the growth of our video conferencing segment depends in part on our ability to increase sales to enterprises with installed bases of competitor equipment  and to enterprises that may purchase competitor equipment in the future 
we believe the ability of our lifesize products to interoperate with the equipment of other telecommunications  video conferencing or telepresence equipment suppliers to be a key factor in purchasing decisions by current or prospective lifesize customers 
in addition  lifesize has broadened its product portfolio to include infrastructure  cloud services and other offerings which require different approaches to developing customer solutions 
sales of retail video products represented and of our total retail sales for the fiscal years ended march  and future sales of tethered consumer webcams in the consumer market is unclear  as the embedded webcam experience appears to be sufficient to meet the needs of many retail consumers as the quality of embedded webcams improves 
at the beginning of the quarter ended march   we launched the logitech hd pro webcam c this product is an example of how we intend to enhance our webcam product line up by enabling experiences that cannot be easily achieved with an embedded webcam 
sales in our digital home category have declined significantly 
we believe the disappointing sales results for harmony fiscal year reflect the aging of our harmony products at the mid and high level price points as we previously directed significant digital home engineering and marketing resources towards our logitech revue and related peripherals for google tv 
we have exited the google tv product category  and we plan to strengthen our harmony line in fiscal year 
table of contents sales of our oem mice and keyboards have historically made up the bulk of our oem sales 
oem sales accounted for and of total revenues during the fiscal years ended march  and in recent years  the shift away from desktop pcs adversely affected our sales of oem mice and keyboards  which are sold with name brand desktop pcs 
we expect this trend to continue and for oem sales to comprise a smaller percentage of our total revenues in the future 
we continue to evaluate potential acquisitions to enhance the breadth and depth of our expertise in engineering and other functional areas  our technologies and our product offerings 
our balance sheet includes goodwill of million related to various past acquisitions which are part of our peripherals reporting unit  and million related to our video conferencing reporting unit 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment test annually as of december  or more frequently  if certain events or circumstances warrant 
events or changes in circumstances which might indicate potential impairment in goodwill include the company specific factors described in our form k  volatility in stock price  a sustained decline in market capitalization relative to net book value  and lower than projected revenue  market growth  or operating results 
management performed a goodwill impairment analysis  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements  of each of our reporting units as of december   and determined that the fair value of our peripherals reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit by more than of the carrying value  and the fair value of our video conferencing reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit by more than of the carrying value 
management continues to evaluate and monitor all key factors impacting the carrying value of our recorded goodwill  as well as other long lived assets 
adverse changes in the company s expected operating results  market capitalization  business climate  or other negative events could result in a material non cash impairment charge in the future 
most of our revenue comes from sales to our retail channels  which resell to consumers  retailers and distributors 
as a result  our customers demand for our products depends in substantial part on trends in consumer confidence and consumer spending  as well as the levels of inventory which our customers  and their customers  choose to maintain 
we use sell through data  which represents sales of our products by our retailer customers to consumers  and by our distributor customers to their customers  along with other metrics to assess consumer demand for our products 
sell through data is subject to limitations due to collection methods and the third party nature of the data and thus may not be an accurate indicator of actual consumer demand for our products 
in addition  the customers supplying sell through data vary by geographic region and from period to period  but typically represent a majority of our retail sales 
although our financial results are reported in us dollars  approximately of our sales for the fiscal year ended march  were made in currencies other than the us dollar  such as the euro  chinese renminbi  japanese yen  canadian dollar and australian dollar 
our product costs are primarily in us dollars and chinese renminbi 
our operating expenses are incurred in us dollars  chinese renminbi  swiss francs  euros  and  to a lesser extent  other currencies 
to the extent that the us dollar significantly increases or decreases in value relative to the currencies in which our sales and operating expenses are denominated  the reported dollar amounts of our sales and expenses may decrease or increase our gross margins vary with the mix of products sold  competitive activity  product life cycle  new product introductions  unit volumes  commodity and supply chain costs  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  geographic sales mix  and the complexity and functionality of new product introductions 
changes in consumer demand affect the need for us to undertake promotional efforts  such as cooperative marketing arrangements  customer incentive programs or other pricing programs  which alter our product gross margins 
gross margins for the fiscal year ended march  were  compared with in fiscal year  primarily due to increased manufacturing and distribution costs  a million inventory valuation adjustment related to logitech revue and related peripherals  and an unfavorable shift in retail product mix towards products with lower average selling prices 

table of contents logitech is incorporated in switzerland but operates in various countries with differing tax laws and rates 
a portion of our income before taxes and the provision for income taxes are generated outside of switzerland 
therefore  our effective income tax rate depends on the amount of profits generated in each of the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
for the fiscal years ended march  and  the income tax provisions were million and million based on effective income tax rates of and of pre tax income 
the change in the effective income tax rate for the fiscal year ended march  compared with was primarily due to the mix of income and losses in the various tax jurisdictions in which the company operates  and a discrete tax benefit of million in fiscal year ended march  for the closure of income tax audits in certain jurisdictions 
the company is under examination in various tax jurisdictions 
the company is not able to estimate the potential impact that these examinations may have on income tax expense 
if the examinations are resolved unfavorably  there is a possibility they may have a material negative impact on our results of operations 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires the company to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we consider an accounting estimate critical if it i requires management to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain  and ii is important to an understanding of logitech s financial condition and operating results 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future  actual results could differ from those estimates 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
we believe the following accounting estimates are most critical to our business operations and to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations  and reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
accruals for customer programs we record accruals for product returns  cooperative marketing arrangements  customer incentive programs and pricing programs 
an allowance against accounts receivable is recorded for accruals and program activity related to our direct customers and those indirect customers who receive payments for program activity through our direct customers 
an accrued liability is recorded for accruals and program activity related to our indirect customers who receive payments directly and do not have a right of offset against a receivable balance 
the estimated cost of these programs is recorded as a reduction of revenue or as an operating expense  if we receive a separately identifiable benefit from the customer and can reasonably estimate the fair value of that benefit 
significant management judgment and estimates must be used to determine the cost of these programs in any accounting period 
returns 
the company grants limited rights to return product 
return rights vary by customer  and range from just the right to return defective product to stock rotation rights limited to a percentage approved by management 
estimates of expected future product returns are recognized at the time of sale based on analyses of historical return trends by customer and by product  inventories owned by and located at distributors and retailers  current customer demand  current operating conditions  and other relevant customer and product information 
return trends are influenced by product life cycle status  new product introductions  market acceptance of products  sales levels  product sell through  the type of customer  seasonality  product quality issues  competitive pressures  operational policies and procedures and other factors 
return rates can fluctuate over time  but are sufficiently predictable to allow us to estimate expected future product returns 

table of contents cooperative marketing arrangements 
we enter into customer marketing programs with many of our distribution and retail customers  and with certain indirect partners  allowing customers to receive a credit equal to a set percentage of their purchases of the company s products  or a fixed dollar credit for various marketing arrangements 
the objective of these arrangements is to encourage advertising and promotional events to increase sales of our products 
accruals for these marketing arrangements are recorded at the time of sale  or time of commitment  based on negotiated terms  historical experience and inventory levels in the channel 
customer incentive programs 
customer incentive programs include performance based incentives and consumer rebates 
we offer performance based incentives to our distribution customers  retail customers and indirect partners based on pre determined performance criteria 
accruals for performance based incentives are recognized as a reduction of the sale price at the time of sale 
estimates of required accruals are determined based on negotiated terms  consideration of historical experience  anticipated volume of future purchases  and inventory levels in the channel 
consumer rebates are offered from time to time at the company s discretion for the primary benefit of end users 
estimated costs of consumer rebates and similar incentives are recorded at the time the incentive is offered  based on the specific terms and conditions 
certain incentive programs  including consumer rebates  require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular programs 
pricing programs 
we have agreements with certain of our customers that contain terms allowing price protection credits to be issued in the event of a subsequent price reduction 
at management s discretion  we also offer special pricing discounts to certain customers 
special pricing discounts are usually offered only for limited time periods or for sales of selected products to specific indirect partners 
our decision to make price reductions is influenced by product life cycle stage  market acceptance of products  the competitive environment  new product introductions and other factors 
estimates of expected future pricing actions are recognized at the time of sale based on analyses of historical pricing actions by customer and by product  inventories owned by and located at distributors and retailers  current customer demand  current operating conditions  and other relevant customer and product information  such as stage of product life cycle 
we regularly evaluate the adequacy of our accruals for product returns  cooperative marketing arrangements  customer incentive programs and pricing programs 
future market conditions and product transitions may require the company to take action to increase such programs 
in addition  when the variables used to estimate these costs change  or if actual costs differ significantly from the estimates  we would be required to record incremental increases or reductions to revenue or increase operating expenses 
if  at any future time  the company becomes unable to reasonably estimate these costs  recognition of revenue might be deferred until products are sold to end users  which would adversely impact revenue in the period of transition 
investment securities our investment securities portfolio as of march  and consisted of bank time deposits  marketable securities related to a deferred compensation plan and auction rate securities collateralized by residential and commercial mortgages 
the bank time deposits are classified as cash equivalents  and are recorded at cost  which approximates fair value 
the marketable securities related to the deferred compensation plan are classified as non current trading investments  and are recorded at fair value based on quoted market prices 
the auction rate securities are classified as non current available for sale assets  and are recorded at estimated fair value  determined by estimating future cash flows through time according to each security s terms  including periodic consideration of overcollateralization and interest coverage tests  and incorporating estimates of default rate  loss severity  prepayment  and delinquency assumptions when available  for the underlying assets in the securities based on representative indices and various research reports 
the estimated coupon and principal payments are discounted at the rate of 
table of contents return required by investors  based on the characteristics of each security as calculated from the indices 
the markets for the auction rate securities which the company holds as of march  have failed since august and are not expected to resume in the foreseeable future  if at all 
allowance for doubtful accounts we sell our products through a worldwide network of distributors  retailers  value added resellers  business enterprises and oem customers 
logitech generally does not require any collateral from its customers 
however  we seek to control our credit risk through ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts 
the allowances are based on management s assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts  including their credit worthiness and financial condition  as well as the company s historical experience with bad debts and customer deductions  receivables aging  current economic trends and geographic or country specific risks and the financial condition of our distribution channel 
if management determines that a customer s accounts receivable balance is uncollectible  recognition of revenue from that customer is deferred until collectibility is reasonably assured 
as of march   one customer group represented of total accounts receivable 
the customers comprising the ten highest outstanding trade receivable balances accounted for approximately of total accounts receivable as of march  a deterioration of a significant customer s financial condition could cause actual write offs to be materially different from the estimated allowance 
if any of these customers receivable balances should be deemed uncollectible or if actual write offs are higher than historical experience  we would have to make adjustments to our allowance for doubtful accounts  which could result in an increase in the company s operating expenses 
inventory valuation the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of customer orders 
further  our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  short term customer commitments and rapid changes in demand 
we record inventories at the lower of cost or market value and record write downs of inventories which are obsolete or in excess of anticipated demand or market value 
a review of inventory is performed each fiscal quarter that considers factors including the marketability and product life cycle stage  product development plans  component cost trends  demand forecasts and current sales levels 
we identify inventory exposures by comparing inventory on hand  in the channel and on order to historical and forecasted sales over six month periods 
inventory on hand which is not expected to be sold or utilized based on review of forecasted sales and utilization is considered excess  and we recognize the write off in cost of sales at the time of such determination 
the write off is determined by comparison of the current replacement cost with the estimated selling price less any costs of completion and disposal net realizable value and the net realizable value less an allowance for normal profit 
at the time of loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances would not result in an increase in the cost basis 
if there were an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for logitech s products or an unanticipated change in technological or customer requirements  we may be required to record additional write downs which could adversely affect gross margins in the period when the write downs are recorded 

table of contents share based compensation expense share based compensation expense includes compensation expense  reduced for estimated forfeitures  for awards granted after april  based on the grant date fair value 
the grant date fair value for stock options and stock purchase rights is estimated using the black scholes merton option pricing valuation model 
the grant date fair value of rsus restricted stock units which vest upon meeting certain market conditions is estimated using the monte carlo simulation method 
the grant date fair value of time based rsus is calculated based on the share market price on the date of grant 
for stock options and restricted stock assumed by logitech when lifesize was acquired  the grant date used to estimate fair value was deemed to be december   the date of acquisition 
compensation expense for awards granted or assumed after april  is recognized on a straight line basis over the service period of the award 
for share based compensation awards granted prior to but not yet vested as of april   share based compensation expense is based on the grant date fair value estimated using the black scholes merton option pricing valuation model reduced for estimated forfeitures  and recognized on a straight line basis over the service period for each separately vesting portion of the award 
see note employee benefit plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of share based compensation 
our estimates of share based compensation expense require a number of complex and subjective assumptions including our stock price volatility  employee exercise patterns  future forfeitures  dividend yield  related tax effects and the selection of an appropriate fair value model 
we estimate expected share price volatility based on historical volatility using daily prices over the term of past options  rsus or purchase offerings  as we consider historical share price volatility as most representative of future volatility 
we estimate expected life based on historical settlement rates  which we believe are most representative of future exercise and post vesting termination behaviors 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting forfeitures  and we record share based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
the dividend yield assumption is based on the company s history and future expectations of dividend payouts 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based compensation expense and related tax effects represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  or if we decide to use a different valuation model  our share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future from what we have recorded in the current period  which could materially affect our results of operations 
accounting for income taxes logitech operates in multiple jurisdictions and its profits are taxed pursuant to the tax laws of these jurisdictions 
the company s effective income tax rate may be affected by the changes in or interpretations of tax laws in any given jurisdiction  utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  changes in geographical mix of income and expense  and changes in management s assessment of matters such as the ability to realize deferred tax assets 
as a result of these considerations  we must estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  considering all available evidence such as historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies 
we believe it is more likely than not such assets will be realized  however  ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time 
when we determine that we 
table of contents are not able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets  an adjustment is charged to earnings in the period when such determination is made 
likewise  if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized  the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 
we make certain estimates and judgments about the application of tax law  the expected resolution of uncertain tax positions and other matters surrounding the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax benefits 
in the event that uncertain tax positions are resolved for amounts different than our estimates  or the related statutes of limitations expire without the assessment of additional income taxes  we will be required to adjust the amounts of the related assets and liabilities in the period in which such events occur 
such adjustments may have a material impact on our income tax provision and our results of operations 
valuation of long lived assets we review long lived assets  such as investments  property  plant and equipment  and goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment whenever events indicate that the carrying amount of these assets might not be recoverable 
factors considered important which could require us to review an asset for impairment include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or the strategy for the company s overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in the company s stock price for a sustained period  and market capitalization relative to net book value 
recoverability of investments  property  plant and equipment  and other intangible assets is measured by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate with its carrying amount 
if an asset is considered impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment test annually as of december  or more frequently  if certain events or circumstances warrant 
events or changes in circumstances which might indicate potential impairment in goodwill include the company specific factors described in our form k  volatility in stock price  a sustained decline in market capitalization relative to net book value  and lower than projected revenue  market growth  or operating results 
management performed a goodwill impairment analysis  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements  of each of our reporting units as of december   and determined that the fair value of our peripherals reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit by more than of the carrying value  and the fair value of our video conferencing reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit by more than of the carrying value 
management continues to evaluate and monitor all key factors impacting the carrying value of our recorded goodwill  as well as other long lived assets 
adverse changes in the company s expected operating results  market capitalization  business climate  or other negative events could result in a material non cash impairment charge in the future 
in determining fair value  we consider various factors including estimates of future market growth and trends  forecasted revenue and costs  expected periods over which our assets will be utilized  and other variables 
we calculate the company s fair value based on the present value of projected cash flows using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate to the risk inherent in the company s current business model 
we also consider the company s operating results  market capitalization  business climate  and other factors 
to date  we have not recognized any impairment of goodwill 
logitech bases its fair value estimates on assumptions it believes to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic 
asu provides entities the option to first assess qualitatively whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
if an entity concludes  as a result of its qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the quantitative two step goodwill impairment test is required 
an entity may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed to perform the first step of the two step goodwill impairment test 
asu is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  the company will adopt asu in the first quarter of fiscal year the adoption of asu is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
as a global concern  the company faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial results 
foreign currency exchange rates the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk as it transacts business in multiple foreign currencies  including exposure related to anticipated sales  anticipated purchases and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
logitech transacts business in over currencies worldwide  of which the most significant to operations are the cny chinese renminbi  taiwanese dollar  australian dollar  japanese yen  mexican peso  euro and canadian dollar 
the functional currency of the company s operations is primarily the us dollar 
to a lesser extent  certain operations use the euro  cny  swiss franc  or the local currency of the country as their functional currencies 
accordingly  unrealized foreign currency gains or losses resulting from the translation of net assets or liabilities denominated in foreign currencies to the us dollar are accumulated in the cumulative translation adjustment component of other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
the table below provides information about the company s underlying transactions that are sensitive to foreign exchange rate changes  primarily assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency  where the net exposure is greater than million at march  the table also presents the us dollar impact on earnings of a appreciation and a depreciation of the functional currency as compared with the transaction currency in thousands functional currency transaction currency net exposed long short currency position fx gain loss from appreciation of functional currency fx gain loss from depreciation of functional currency us dollar chinese renminbi    taiwanese dollar us dollar    us dollar australian dollar    japanese yen us dollar  mexican peso us dollar  euro british pound  us dollar canadian dollar  euro swiss franc  singapore dollar us dollar  euro swedish krona us dollar swiss franc euro norwegian krone euro romanian leu euro russian ruble euro polish zloty long currency positions represent net assets being held in the transaction currency while short currency positions represent net liabilities being held in the transaction currency 

table of contents the company s principal manufacturing operations are located in china  with much of its component and raw material costs transacted in cny 
however  the functional currency of its chinese operating subsidiary is the us dollar as its sales and trade receivables are transacted in us dollars 
to hedge against any potential significant appreciation of the cny  the company maintains a portion of its cash investments in cny denominated accounts 
at march   net assets held in cny totaled million 
the company continues to evaluate the level of net assets held in cny relative to component and raw material purchases and interest rates on cash equivalents 
the company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge against exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to its subsidiaries forecasted inventory purchases 
the primary risk managed by using derivative instruments is the foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the company has designated these derivatives as cash flow hedges 
logitech does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
these hedging contracts generally mature within four months  and are denominated in the same currency as the underlying transactions 
gains and losses in the fair value of the effective portion of the hedges are deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged inventory purchases are sold  at which time the gains or losses are reclassified to cost of goods sold 
the company assesses the effectiveness of the hedges by comparing changes in the spot rate of the currency underlying the forward contract with changes in the spot rate of the currency in which the forecasted transaction will be consummated 
if the underlying transaction being hedged fails to occur or if a portion of the hedge does not generate offsetting changes in the foreign currency exposure of forecasted inventory purchases  the company immediately recognizes the gain or loss on the associated financial instrument in other income expense 
as of march   the notional amounts of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding related to forecasted inventory purchases were million million 
deferred realized losses of million are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss at march   and are expected to be reclassified to cost of goods sold when the related inventory is sold 
deferred unrealized gains of million related to open cash flow hedges are also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss as of march  and these forward contracts will be revalued in future periods until the related inventory is sold  at which time the resulting gains or losses will be reclassified to cost of goods sold 
the company also enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the short term effects of foreign currency fluctuations on certain foreign currency receivables or payables 
these forward contracts generally mature within three months 
the company may also enter into foreign exchange swap contracts to economically extend the terms of its foreign exchange forward contracts 
the primary risk managed by using forward and swap contracts is the foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the gains or losses on foreign exchange forward contracts are recognized in earnings based on the changes in fair value 
cash flows from these contracts are classified as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
the notional amounts of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at march  relating to foreign currency receivables or payables were million 
open forward contracts as of march  consisted of contracts in british pounds to sell euros and contracts in australian dollars to purchase us dollars at future dates at a predetermined exchange rate 
the notional amounts of foreign exchange swap contracts outstanding at march  were million 
swap contracts outstanding at march  consisted of contracts in taiwanese dollars  mexican pesos and japanese yen 
unrealized net gains on the contracts outstanding at march  were million 
if the us dollar had appreciated by at march  compared with the foreign currencies in which we have forward or swap contracts  an unrealized gain of million in our forward foreign exchange contract portfolio would have occurred 
if the us dollar had depreciated by compared with the foreign currencies in which we have forward or swap contracts  a million unrealized loss in our forward foreign exchange contract portfolio would have occurred 

table of contents interest rates changes in interest rates could impact the company s anticipated interest income on its cash equivalents and investment securities 
the company prepared sensitivity analyses of its interest rate exposures to assess the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates 
based on the results of these analyses  a basis point decrease or increase in interest rates from the march  and march  period end rates would not have a material effect on the company s results of operations or cash flows
