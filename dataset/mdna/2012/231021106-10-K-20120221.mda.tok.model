our md a is presented in the following sections executive summary and financial highlights outlook results of operations restructuring and other charges operating segment results liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations and other commercial commitments application of critical accounting estimates recently adopted and recently issued accounting pronouncements 
table of contents executive summary and financial highlights we are a global power leader that designs  manufactures  distributes and services diesel and natural gas engines and engine related component products  including filtration  exhaust aftertreatment  fuel systems  controls systems  air handling systems and electric power generation systems 
we sell our products to original equipment manufacturers oems  distributors and other customers worldwide 
we have long standing relationships with many of the leading manufacturers in the markets we serve  including paccar inc  chrysler group  llc  daimler trucks north america  man nutzfahrzeuge ag  ford motor company  komatsu  volvo ab and case new holland 
we serve our customers through a network of more than company owned and independent distributor locations and approximately  dealer locations in more than countries and territories 
our reportable operating segments consist of the following engine  components  power generation and distribution 
this reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves and allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers 
the engine segment produces engines and parts for sale to customers in on highway and various industrial markets 
our engines are used in trucks of all sizes  buses and recreational vehicles  as well as in various industrial applications  including construction  mining  agriculture  marine  oil and gas  rail and military equipment 
the components segment sells filtration products  exhaust aftertreatment systems  turbochargers and fuel systems 
the power generation segment is an integrated provider of power systems which sells engines  generator sets and alternators 
the distribution segment includes wholly owned and partially owned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines  generator sets and service parts  as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various oems throughout the world 
our financial performance depends  in large part  on varying conditions in the markets we serve  particularly the on highway  construction and general industrial markets 
demand in these markets tends to fluctuate in response to overall economic conditions and is particularly sensitive to changes in interest rate levels and our customers access to credit 
our sales may also be impacted by oem inventory levels and production schedules and stoppages 
economic downturns in markets we serve generally result in reductions in sales and pricing of our products 
as a worldwide business  our operations are also affected by currency  political  economic and regulatory matters  including adoption and enforcement of environmental and emission standards  in the countries we serve 
as part of our growth strategy  we invest in businesses in certain countries that carry high levels of these risks such as china  brazil  india  mexico  south africa  russia and countries in the middle east 
at the same time  our geographic diversity and broad product and service offerings have helped limit the impact from a drop in demand in any one industry or customer or the economy of any single country on our consolidated results 
in  certain north american markets experienced robust recoveries  especially the north american on highway markets which was enhanced by the depletion of transition engine inventory purchased in in advance of the epa s emission change 
demand for heavy duty on highway products in north america was three times higher in compared to and medium duty truck and bus shipments in north america were two times higher 
north american oil and gas markets and global mining markets also continued to experience strong growth in emerging markets continued to experience strong growth in  especially in the international construction markets 
emerging market growth was particularly strong in china  india and brazil  although the growth rates began to soften in the second half of the year  especially in the on highway truck and off highway construction markets in china and power generation markets in india 
growth rates are slowing in certain emerging markets like china and india as governments look to control inflation through tight monetary policies in the form of rising interest rates and tightening access to credit 
currently  inflation concerns appear to be declining in china and there is a growing expectation that the government will start to ease monetary policy  which would enhance our end markets 
inflation concerns in india also appear to be 
table of contents declining 
the european economy remains an uncertainty as we enter  with continued volatility in the euro countries 
although we do not have any significant direct exposure to european sovereign debt  we do generate approximately nine percent of our net sales from euro zone countries 
therefore  continued economic decline in europe could have an adverse impact on our financial results

liquidity and capital resources management s assessment of liquidity our financial condition and liquidity continue to strengthen 
our solid balance sheet and credit ratings enable us to have ready access to credit 
we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate adequate cash to fund our operating  investing and financing activities 
we generate significant ongoing cash flow  which has been used  in part  to fund repurchases of common stock  capital expenditures and pay dividends on our common stock 
our cash flow from operations in more than doubled the cash flow from operations 
cash provided by operations is our principal source of liquidity 
as of december   other sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents of billion  of which approximately percent was located in the us and percent was located primarily in the uk  china  brazil and india  
table of contents marketable securities of million  which were located primarily in india and brazil and the majority of which could be liquidated into cash within a few days  revolving credit facility with billion available  net of outstanding letters of credit  international and other domestic credit facilities with million available and accounts receivable sales program with million available  based on eligible receivables 
we believe our liquidity provides us with the financial flexibility needed to fund working capital  capital expenditures  projected pension obligations  dividend payments  common stock repurchases and debt service obligations 
our revolving credit agreement provides us with a billion unsecured revolving credit facility  the proceeds of which are to be used for our general corporate purposes 
see note  debt to our consolidated financial statements for further information 
the credit agreement includes two financial covenants a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio 
the required leverage ratio  which measures the sum of total debt plus securitization financing to consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda for the four fiscal quarters may not exceed to at december   our leverage ratio was to the required interest coverage ratio  which is consolidated ebitda minus capital expenditures to consolidated interest expense  in each case for the prior four quarters  may not be less than to at december   our interest coverage ratio was to a significant portion of our cash flows is generated outside the us as of december   the total of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was billion  the vast majority of which was located in the uk  china  india  brazil and singapore 
the geographic location of our cash and marketable securities aligns well with our business growth strategy 
we manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed 
as a result  we do not anticipate any local liquidity restrictions to preclude us from funding our expansion or operating needs with local resources 
if the foreign cash balances were repatriated to the us we could be required to accrue and pay us taxes for earnings primarily from our uk domiciled subsidiaries  as we have asserted that these earnings are permanently reinvested outside of the us at present we do not foresee an immediate need to repatriate any earnings from these subsidiaries in the near future 
however  we do anticipate repatriating available cash from foreign subsidiaries to help fund us cash needs as they arise  and we have transferred and will continue to transfer cash from these subsidiaries to the us and to other international subsidiaries when it is cost effective to do so 
earnings from our china operations will be considered permanently reinvested beginning in  while earnings generated prior to  for which us deferred tax liabilities have already been recorded  will be repatriated in future years 
we continuously monitor our pension assets and believe that we have limited exposure to the european debt crisis 
no sovereign debt instruments of crisis countries are held in the trusts  while any equities are held with large well diversified multinational firms or are de minimis amounts in large index funds 
in addition  we rebalanced our asset portfolios in the us and the us in with equities representing a smaller segment of the total portfolios and we continue to rebalance as necessary to maintain our target range 
our pension plans have not experienced any significant impact on liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the volatility in the credit markets 
the maturity schedule of our existing long term debt does not require significant cash outflows in the intermediate term 
required annual principal payments range from million to million over each of the next five years

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap which often requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts presented and disclosed in the financial statements 
management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience  changes in business conditions and other relevant factors they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
in any given reporting period  our actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates are defined as follows the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made  different estimates reasonably could have been used  or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and the change would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies  related accounting estimates and the disclosures set forth below with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe our critical accounting estimates include those addressing the estimation of liabilities for warranty programs  recoverability of investment related to new products  accounting for income taxes and pension benefits 
warranty programs we estimate and record a liability for base warranty programs at the time our products are sold 
our estimates are based on historical experience and reflect management s best estimates of expected costs at the time products are sold and subsequent adjustment to those expected costs when actual costs differ 
as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall programs  the liability for such programs is recorded when we commit to a recall action or when a recall becomes probable and estimable  which generally occurs when it is announced 
our warranty liability is generally affected by component failure rates  repair costs and the point of failure within the product life cycle 
future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to our liability 
new product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available 
product specific experience is typically available four or five quarters after product launch  with a clear experience trend evident eight quarters after launch 
we generally record warranty expense for new products upon shipment using a preceding product s warranty history and a multiplicative factor based upon preceding similar product experience and new product assessment until sufficient new product data is available for warranty estimation 
we then use a blend of actual new product experience and preceding product 
table of contents historical experience for several subsequent quarters  and new product specific experience thereafter 
note  product warranty liability  to our consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the activity in our warranty liability account for and including adjustments to pre existing warranties 
recoverability of investment related to new products at december   we have capitalized million associated with the future launch of our light duty diesel engine product 
development of this product began in market uncertainty related to the global recession that began in resulted in some customers delaying or cancelling their vehicle programs 
at december   we reviewed our investment of million for possible impairment 
we used projections to assess whether future cash flows on an undiscounted basis related to the assets are likely to exceed the related carrying amount to determine if a write down is appropriate 
these projections required estimates about product volume and the size of the market for vehicles that are not yet developed 
we used input from our customers in developing alternative cash flow scenarios 
our analysis indicated that the assets were recoverable 
customers that are expected to purchase sufficient quantities to recover our investment in the light duty diesel engine products remained active with the development of this product through and there were no significant changes to the assumptions used in if customer expectations or projected volumes deteriorate and we do not identify alternative customers and or product applications  we could be required to write down these assets to net realizable value 
accounting for income taxes we determine our income tax expense using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
future tax benefits of tax loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets 
at december   we recorded net deferred tax assets of million 
these assets included million for the value of tax loss and credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance of million was recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believed was more likely than not to be realized 
in the event our operating performance deteriorates  future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets 
in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time to resolve 
we reduce our net tax assets for the estimated additional tax and interest that may result from tax authorities disputing uncertain tax positions we have taken and we believe we have made adequate provision for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit based upon the latest information available 
a more complete description of our income taxes and the future benefits of our tax loss and credit carryforwards is disclosed in note  income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements 
pension benefits we sponsor a number of pension plans primarily in the us and the uk and to a lesser degree in various other countries 
in the uk and the uk we have several major defined benefit plans that are separately funded 
we account for our pension programs in accordance with employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans under gaap 
gaap requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined using an actuarial basis 
as a result  our pension benefit programs are based on a number of statistical and judgmental assumptions that attempt to 
table of contents anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans each year at december these assumptions include discount rates used to value liabilities  assumed rates of return on plan assets  future compensation increases  employee turnover rates  actuarial assumptions relating to retirement age  mortality rates and participant withdrawals 
the actuarial assumptions we use may differ significantly from actual results due to changing economic conditions  participant life span and withdrawal rates 
these differences may result in a material impact to the amount of net periodic pension expense to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements in the future 
the expected long term return on plan assets is used in calculating the net periodic pension expense 
we considered several factors in developing our expected rate of return on plan assets 
the long term rate of return considers historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations and is generally applied to a year average market value of return 
projected returns are based primarily on broad  publicly traded equity and fixed income indices and forward looking estimates of active portfolio and investment management 
as of december   based upon our target asset allocations it is anticipated that our us investment policy will generate an average annual return over the year projection period equal to or in excess of percent approximately percent of the time while returns of percent or greater are anticipated percent of the time 
we expect additional positive returns from active investment management 
the one year return was percent  combined with the very favorable returns in has eliminated the significant deterioration in pension assets experienced in as a result of the credit crisis and related market recession 
based on the historical returns and forward looking return expectations  we believe an investment return assumption of percent per year in for us pension assets is reasonable 
the methodology used to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets in the uk was based on establishing an equity risk premium over current long term bond yields adjusted based on target asset allocations 
as of december   based upon our target asset allocations  it is anticipated that our uk investment policy will generate an average annual return over the year projection period equal to or in excess of percent approximately percent of the time while returns of percent or greater are anticipated percent of the time 
we expect additional positive returns from active investment management 
the one year return for our uk plan was approximately six percent for and similar to our us plan  the market related deterioration in our plan assets has been eliminated 
our strategy with respect to our investments in pension plan assets is to be invested with a long term outlook 
therefore  the risk and return balance of our asset portfolio should reflect a long term horizon 
based on the historical returns and forward looking return expectations  we believe an investment return assumption of percent in for uk pension assets is reasonable 
our pension plan asset allocation at december  and and target allocation for are as follows us plans us plans percentage of plan assets at december  percentage of plan assets at december  target allocation target allocation investment description equity securities fixed income real estate other total 
table of contents the differences between the actual return on plan assets and expected long term return on plan assets are recognized in the asset value used to calculate net periodic expense over five years 
the table below sets forth the expected return assumptions used to develop our pension expense for the period and our expected rate for long term expected return assumptions us plans non us plans a lower expected rate of return will increase our net periodic pension expense and reduce profitability 
gaap for pensions offers various acceptable alternatives to account for the differences that eventually arise between the estimates used in the actuarial valuations and the actual results 
it is acceptable to delay or immediately recognize these differences 
under the delayed recognition alternative  changes in pension obligation including those resulting from plan amendments and changes in the value of assets set aside to meet those obligation are not recognized in net periodic pension cost as they occur but are recognized initially in comprehensive income and subsequently amortized as components of net periodic pension cost systematically and gradually over future periods 
in addition to this approach  gaap also allows immediate recognition of gains or losses 
immediate recognition introduces volatility in financial results 
we have chosen to delay recognition and amortize actuarial differences over future periods 
if we adopted the immediate recognition approach  we would record a loss of  million million after tax for our us and us pension plans 
the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred from recognition in our results of operations and  under certain circumstances such as when the difference exceeds percent of the market value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation pbo  amortized over future years of service 
this is also true of changes to actuarial assumptions 
as of december   we had net pension actuarial losses of million and million for the us and us pension plans  respectively 
under gaap  the actuarial gains and losses are recognized and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
increases in actuarial losses decreased our shareholders equity by million after tax in the increases were due to liability losses from reduced discount rates  partially offset by improved us plan asset performance in as these amounts exceed percent of our pbo  the excess is amortized over the average remaining service lives of participating employees 
the table below sets forth the net periodic pension expense for the period through and our expected expense for net periodic pension expense in millions pension expense we expect pension expense to be approximately the same as  the favorable impacts of investment returns and higher asset values are offset by higher service cost due to increased headcount and a decrease in discount rate 
the decrease in periodic pension expense in  was due to improved returns on assets as the capital markets began to recover  strong contributions in and the absence of any curtailment charges 
the decrease in periodic pension expense in was due to improved returns on assets as the capital markets began to recover  strong contributions in and the absence of any curtailment charges 
another key assumption used in the development of the net 
table of contents periodic pension expense is the discount rate 
the weighted average discount rates used to develop our net periodic pension expense are set forth in the table below 
discount rates us plans non us plans changes in the discount rate assumptions will impact the interest cost component of the net periodic pension expense calculation 
the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date 
the guidelines for setting this rate are discussed in gaap which suggests the use of a high quality corporate bond rate 
we used bond information provided by moody s investor service inc  standard poor s rating services  fitch ratings and dominion bond rating 
all bonds used to develop our hypothetical portfolio in the us and us were high quality  non callable bonds aa or better as of december   by at least two of the bond rating agencies 
the average yield of this hypothetical bond portfolio was used as the benchmark for determining the discount rate to be used to value the obligations of the plans subject to gaap for pensions and other postretirement benefits 
our model called for years of benefit payments for the us plans and years of payments for the uk for both countries  our model matches the present value of the plan s projected benefit payments to the market value of the theoretical settlement bond portfolio 
a single equivalent discount rate is determined to align the present value of the required cash flow with the value of the bond portfolio 
the resulting discount rate is reflective of both the current interest rate environment and the plan s distinct liability characteristics 
the table below sets forth the estimated impact on our net periodic pension expense relative to a change in the discount rate and a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets 
in millions impact on pension expense increase decrease discount rate used to value liabilities percent increase percent decrease expected rate of return on assets one percent increase one percent decrease the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time 
a higher discount rate decreases the plan obligations and decreases our net periodic pension expense 
a lower discount rate increases the plan obligations and increases our net periodic pension expense 
it should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear 
note  pension and other postretirement benefits  to our consolidated financial statements provides a summary of our pension benefit plan activity  the funded status of our plans and the amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents recently adopted and recently issued accounting pronouncements accounting pronouncements recently adopted in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended its standards related to the testing of goodwill for impairment 
the objective of this amendment is to simplify the annual goodwill impairment evaluation process 
the amendment provides entities the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
the two step impairment test is now only required if an entity determines through this qualitative analysis that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
the new rules become effective during interim and annual periods beginning after december   however entities are permitted to early adopt the standard 
we elected to early adopt the standard and applied the qualitative analysis to certain reporting units in our goodwill impairment testing process 
because the measurement of a potential impairment loss has not changed  the standard did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb amended its rules regarding the accounting for multiple element revenue arrangements 
the objective of the amendment is to allow vendors to account for revenue for different deliverables separately as opposed to part of a combined unit when those deliverables are provided at different times 
specifically  this amendment addresses how to separate deliverables and simplifies the process of allocating revenue to the different deliverables when more than one deliverable exists 
the new rules were effective for us beginning january  this amendment did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements as multiple element arrangements are not material to our business 
in june  the fasb amended its existing standards related to the consolidation of variable interest entities  which was effective for interim and annual fiscal periods beginning after november  the new standard requires entities to analyze whether their variable interests give it a controlling financial interest of a variable interest entity vie and outlines what defines a primary beneficiary 
the new standard amends gaap by a changing certain rules for determining whether an entity is a vie  b replacing the quantitative approach previously required for determining the primary beneficiary with a more qualitative approach  and c requiring entities to continuously analyze whether they are the primary beneficiary of a vie among other amendments 
the new standard also requires enhanced disclosures regarding an entity s involvement in a vie 
the only significant impact of the adoption of this standard was to deconsolidate cummins komatsu engine corporation ckec as of january  and to account for ckec under gaap for equity method investees 
ckec is an engine manufacturing entity jointly owned and operated by us and our equity partner 
prior to january   we were deemed the primary beneficiary of this vie due to the pricing arrangements of purchases and the substantial volume of purchases we made from the vie 
the impact of the deconsolidation on our consolidated statements of income was minimal as all sales were eliminated in consolidation in the past 
the most significant impacts on our consolidated balance sheets were to decrease current assets by million  decrease long term assets by million  increase investments and advances related to equity method investees by million and decrease noncontrolling interest by million in accounting pronouncements issued but not yet effective in december  the fasb amended its standards related to offsetting assets and liabilities 
this amendment requires entities to disclose both gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting agreement 
this information will enable users of 
table of contents the financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position 
the new rules will become effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january   and interim periods within those annual periods 
it is also required that the new disclosures are applied retrospectively for all comparative periods presented 
we do not believe this amendment will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements  however we are currently evaluating the potential impacts to our footnote disclosures 
in june  the fasb amended its rules regarding the presentation of comprehensive income 
the objective of this amendment is to improve the comparability  consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income 
specifically  this amendment requires that all non owner changes in shareholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in addition  the standard also requires disclosure of the location of reclassification adjustments between other comprehensive income and net income on the face of the financial statements 
the new rules are scheduled to become effective during interim and annual periods beginning after december  in december  the fasb deferred certain aspects of this standard beyond the current effective date  specifically the provisions dealing with reclassification adjustments 
because the standard only impacts the display of comprehensive income and does not impact what is included in comprehensive income  the standard will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb amended its standards related to fair value measurements and disclosures 
the objective of the amendment is to improve the comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap and international financial reporting standards 
primarily this amendment changed the wording used to describe many of the requirements in us gaap for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements in addition to clarifying the board s intent about the application of existing fair value measurement requirements 
the new standard also requires additional disclosures related to fair value measurements categorized within level of the fair value hierarchy and requires disclosure of the categorization in the hierarchy for items which are not recorded at fair value but fair value is required to be disclosed 
the new rules will become effective during interim and annual periods beginning after december  as of december   we had no fair value measurements categorized within level the only impact for us is expected to be the disclosure of the categorization in the fair value hierarchy for those items where fair value is only disclosed primarily our debt obligations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial risk resulting from volatility in foreign exchange rates  commodity prices and interest rates 
this risk is closely monitored and managed through the use of financial derivative instruments including foreign currency forward contracts  commodity swap contracts and interest rate swaps 
as stated in our policies and procedures  financial derivatives are used expressly for hedging purposes  and under no circumstances are they used for speculative purposes 
when material  we adjust the value of our derivative contracts for counter party or our credit risk 
further information regarding financial instruments and risk management is contained in note  derivatives  to our consolidated financial statements 
the following describes our risk exposures and provides results of sensitivity analysis performed as of december  the sensitivity analysis assumes instantaneous  parallel shifts in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 

table of contents foreign exchange rates as a result of our international business presence  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks 
we transact business in foreign currencies and  as a result  our income experiences some volatility related to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
to help manage our exposure to exchange rate volatility  we use foreign exchange forward contracts on a regular basis to hedge forecasted intercompany and third party sales and purchases denominated in non functional currencies 
our internal policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flows for up to one year 
these foreign currency forward contracts are designated and qualify as foreign currency cash flow hedges under gaap 
the effective portion of the unrealized gain or loss on the forward contract is deferred and reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss aocl 
when the hedged forecasted transaction sale or purchase occurs  the unrealized gain or loss is reclassified into income in the same line item associated with the hedged transaction in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects income 
the ineffective portion of the hedge  unrealized gain or loss  if any  is recognized in current income during the period of change 
as of december   the amount we expect to reclassify from aocl to income over the next year is an unrealized net loss of million 
for the years ended december  and  there were no circumstances that would have resulted in the discontinuance of a foreign currency cash flow hedge 
to minimize the income volatility resulting from the remeasurement of net monetary assets and payables denominated in a currency other than the functional currency  we enter into foreign currency forward contracts  which are considered economic hedges 
the objective is to offset the gain or loss from remeasurement with the gain or loss from the fair market valuation of the forward contract 
these derivative instruments are not designated as hedges under gaap 
as of december   the potential gain or loss in the fair value of our outstanding foreign currency contracts  assuming a hypothetical percent fluctuation in the currencies of such contracts  would be approximately million 
the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next months 
the analysis ignores the impact of foreign exchange movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels 
it should be noted that any change in the value of the contracts  real or hypothetical  would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items see note  derivatives  to our consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates 
we manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations through the use of interest rate swaps 
the objective of the swaps is to more effectively balance our borrowing costs and interest rate risk 
in november  we entered into an interest rate swap to effectively convert our million debt issue  due in  from a fixed rate of percent to a floating rate based on a libor spread 
the terms of the swap mirror those of the debt  with interest paid semi annually 
this swap qualifies as a fair value hedge under gaap 
the gain or loss on this derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current income as interest expense 
the following table summarizes these gains and losses for the years presented below for the years ended december  in millions income statement classification gain loss on swaps gain loss on borrowings gain loss on swaps gain loss on borrowings interest expense 
table of contents commodity price risk we are exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices due to contractual agreements with component suppliers 
in order to protect ourselves against future price volatility and  consequently  fluctuations in gross margins  we periodically enter into commodity swap contracts with designated banks to fix the cost of certain raw material purchases with the objective of minimizing changes in inventory cost due to market price fluctuations 
certain commodity swap contracts are derivative contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges under gaap 
we also have commodity swap contracts that represent an economic hedge  however do not qualify for hedge accounting and are marked to market through earnings 
for those contracts that qualify for hedge accounting  the effective portion of the unrealized gain or loss is deferred and reported as a component of aocl 
when the hedged forecasted transaction purchase occurs  the unrealized gain or loss is reclassified into income in the same line item associated with the hedged transaction in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects income 
the ineffective portion of the hedge  if any  is recognized in current income in the period in which the ineffectiveness occurs 
as of december   we expect to reclassify an unrealized net loss of million from aocl to income over the next year 
our internal policy allows for managing these cash flow hedges for up to three years 
as of december   the potential gain or loss related to the outstanding commodity swap contracts  assuming a hypothetical percent fluctuation in the price of such commodities  was million 
the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in commodity prices assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next months 
the analysis ignores the impact of commodity price movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels 
it should be noted that any change in the value of the swap contracts  real or hypothetical  would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items see note  derivatives  to the consolidated financial statements
