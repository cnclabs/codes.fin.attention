presentation of financial and operating data we operate on a fiscal year that ends on the last tuesday in december 
fiscal years  and were weeks in length  while the quarters for those years were weeks in length 
long term strategies to grow earnings per share our long term strategies with respect to increasing net income and earnings per share include the following expanding our restaurant base 
we will continue to evaluate opportunities to develop texas roadhouse restaurants in existing markets and new domestic or international markets 
domestically  we will remain focused primarily on mid sized markets where we believe a significant demand for our restaurants exists because of population size  income levels and the presence of shopping and entertainment centers and a significant employment base 
our ability to expand our restaurant base is influenced by many factors beyond our control and therefore we may not be able to achieve our anticipated growth 
we moderated our restaurant development plans for and due  in part  to increasing restaurant development costs  particularly during to in  our new store returns increased due  in part  to our ability to lower restaurant development costs  along with improved sales in as a result  we increased development to restaurants in and plan to 
table of contents open restaurants in our average capital investment for texas roadhouse restaurants opened during  including pre opening expenses  was million  which is relatively unchanged from our average capital investment in of million 
we anticipate that our development costs will be consistent with our costs 
we continue to focus on driving sales and managing restaurant development costs in order to further increase our restaurant development in the future 
we may  at our discretion  add franchise restaurants  domestically and or internationally  primarily with franchisees who have demonstrated prior success with the texas roadhouse or other restaurant concepts and in markets in which the franchisee demonstrates superior knowledge of the demographics and restaurant operating conditions 
in conjunction with this strategy  we signed our first international franchise agreement on in for the development of texas roadhouse restaurants in eight countries in the middle east over the next ten years  the first of which opened in august additionally  in  we entered into a joint venture agreement with a casual dining restaurant operator in china for minority ownership in three non texas roadhouse restaurants  one of which opened in we continue to explore opportunities in other countries for international expansion 
we may also look to acquire franchise restaurants under terms favorable to the company and our stockholders 
additionally  from time to time  we will evaluate potential mergers  acquisitions  joint ventures or other strategic initiatives to acquire or develop additional concepts 
of the restaurants we owned and operated at the end of  operated as texas roadhouse restaurants  while three operated under the name of aspen creek 
all of our planned restaurant growth in will be texas roadhouse restaurants 
maintaining and or improving restaurant level profitability 
we plan to maintain  or possibly increase  restaurant level profitability through a combination of increased comparable restaurant sales and operating cost management 
in  our average unit volumes and comparable restaurant sales increased and  respectively for texas roadhouse restaurants 
the growth in these measures was primarily due to higher guest traffic counts and increases in menu pricing taken throughout we believe the increased guest traffic counts is due to our continued focus on encouraging repeat visits by our guests by not sacrificing any operational standards relating to our quality of food and service  along with an improvement in the overall economy 
we also continue to drive various localized marketing programs in order to attract new guests and increase the frequency of visits of our existing guests 
in an effort to partially offset inflationary pressures  we have increased menu prices approximately and in and  respectively 
in general  we continue to maintain our conservative approach on pricing as we remain focused on the long term success of texas roadhouse 
this may create a challenge in terms of maintaining and or increasing restaurant margins  as a percentage of sales  in any given year  depending on the level of inflation we experience 
in addition to restaurant margin  as a percentage of sales  we also focus on restaurant margin dollar growth per store week as a measure of restaurant level profitability 
while our average unit volumes and comparable restaurant sales increased in  these measures declined from through primarily as a result of lower guest traffic counts and lower increases in average guest check 
we believe the lower guest traffic counts across these periods were primarily attributable to a general softening of the overall consumer environment  consistent with the casual dining industry  as a whole  experiencing lower guest traffic counts 
during this three year span  consumer casual dining restaurant demand was negatively impacted by increasing unemployment rates and higher menu prices resulting from inflationary pressures such as certain state minimum and tipped wage increases  along with higher gasoline prices 
in addition  we experienced guests shifting their selections to lower priced menu items and or purchasing fewer alcoholic beverages over the last few years 
we believe all of these pressures negatively impacted guest traffic counts and average guest check  for us  as well as the industry 
leveraging our scalable infrastructure 
to support our growth  we continue to make investments in our infrastructure 
over the past several years  we have made significant investments in our infrastructure including information systems  real estate  human resources  legal  marketing and 
table of contents operations 
in  general and administrative costs increased at a slower growth rate than our revenue 
whether we are able to continue leveraging our infrastructure will depend  in part  on our new restaurant and comparable restaurant sales growth rates going forward 
returning capital to shareholders 
we continue to look at opportunities to return capital to our shareholders  including through the repurchases of common stock and the payment of dividends 
in  we paid million to repurchase  shares of our common stock and implemented a dividend program through which we declared quarterly dividends of per share of common stock 
since  we have paid million to repurchase  shares of our common stock 
in  we paid dividends of million 
in  we increased our first quarter dividend to per share of common stock and our long term strategy includes increasing that amount over time 
the declaration and payment of cash dividends on our common stock is at the discretion of our board of directors  and any decision to declare a dividend will be based on a number of factors  including  but not limited to  earnings  financial condition  applicable covenants under our credit facility and other contractual restrictions  or other factors deemed relevant

for  the exemptions under the hire act were replaced by a tax credit which results in a reduction in income tax expense rather than payroll tax expense 
for  the net impact of this change year over year was an increase in payroll expense of million

recent accounting pronouncements fair value measures and disclosures asu in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu which amends asc  fair value measures and disclosures 
asu no 
amends the asc to require disclosure of transfer into and out of level and level fair value measurements  and also require more detailed disclosure about the activity within level fair value measurements 
the changes as a result of this update are effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after december  our fiscal year  except for requirements related to level disclosures  which are effective for annual and interim period beginning after december  our fiscal year 
this guidance requires new disclosures only  and had no impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
comprehensive income asu in june  the fasb issued asu  presentation of comprehensive income 
asu eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity  which is our current presentation  and also requires presentation of reclassification adjustments from other comprehensive income to net income on the face of the financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued asu  deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in asu  to defer the effective date of the specific requirement to present items that are reclassified out of accumulated comprehensive income to net income alongside their respective components of net income and other comprehensive income

the adoption of this new guidance will have no impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows  though it will change our financial statement presentation 
goodwill and other intangibles asu in september  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other  testing goodwill for impairment  which permits an entity to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying value before applying the two step goodwill impairment model that is currently in place 
if it is determined through the qualitative assessment that a reporting unit s fair value is more likely than not greater than its carrying value  the remaining impairment steps would be unnecessary 
the qualitative assessment is optional  allowing companies to go directly to the quantitative assessment 
this update is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed in fiscal years beginning after december  our fiscal year  with early adoption permitted 
we do not anticipate any changes to the content of our financial statements or disclosures as a result of adopting this guidance 
critical accounting policies and estimates the above discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that we believe are most important to portraying our financial condition and results of operations and also require the greatest amount of subjective or complex judgments by management 
judgments or uncertainties regarding the application of these policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment at the individual restaurant level when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable 
when we evaluate restaurants  cash flows are the primary indicator of impairment 
our evaluation requires an estimation of the future undiscounted cash flows from operating the restaurant over its estimated useful life  which can be for a period of over years 
in the estimation of future cash flows  we consider the period of time the restaurant has been open  the trend of operations over such period and future periods and expectations for future sales growth 
we limit assumptions about important factors such as trend of future operations and sales growth to those that are supportable based upon our plans for the restaurant and actual results at comparable restaurants 
both qualitative and quantitative information are considered when evaluating for potential impairments 
as we assess the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of our long lived assets  these factors could cause us to realize a material impairment charge 

table of contents if assets are determined to be impaired  we measure the impairment charge by calculating the amount by which the asset carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
the determination of asset fair value is also subject to significant judgment 
we generally measure estimated fair value by discounting estimated future cash flows or by independent third party appraisal  if available 
when fair value is measured by discounting estimated future cash flows  the assumptions used are consistent with what we believe hypothetical market participants would use 
we also use a discount rate that is commensurate with the risk inherent in the projected cash flows 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
see note in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding closures and impairments recorded in  and  including the impairments of goodwill and other long lived assets 
goodwill 
goodwill is tested annually for impairment  and is tested more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
we have assigned goodwill to the reporting unit  which we consider to be the individual restaurant level 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 
the determination of impairment consists of two steps 
first  we determine the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to its carrying amount 
the fair value of the reporting unit may be based on several valuation approaches including capitalization of earnings  discounted cash flows  comparable public company market multiples and comparable acquisition market multiples 
second  if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit  in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
the valuation approaches used to determine fair value are subject to key judgments and assumptions that are sensitive to change such as judgment and assumptions about our appropriate revenue growth rates  operating margins  weighted average cost of capital  and comparable company and acquisition market multiples 
in estimating the fair value using the discounted cash flows or the capitalization of earnings method we consider the period of time the restaurant has been open  the trend of operations over such period and future periods  expectations of future sales growth and terminal value 
assumptions about important factors such as trend of future operations and sales growth are limited to those that are supportable based upon the plans for the restaurant and actual results at comparable restaurants 
when developing these key judgments and assumptions  we consider economic  operational and market conditions that could impact our fair value 
the judgments and assumptions used are consistent with what we believe hypothetical market participants would use 
however  estimates are inherently uncertain and represent only our reasonable expectations regarding future developments 
if the estimates used in performing the impairment test prove inaccurate  the fair value of the restaurants may ultimately prove to be significantly lower  thereby causing the carrying value to exceed the fair value and indicating impairment has occurred 
at december   we had reporting units  primarily at the restaurant level  with allocated goodwill of million 
the average amount of goodwill associated with each reporting unit is million with six reporting units having goodwill in excess of million 
based on our estimate of fair value  we are currently monitoring seven restaurants with total goodwill of million for potential impairment 
since we determine the fair value of goodwill at the restaurant level  any significant decreases in cash flows at these restaurants or others could trigger an impairment charge in the future 
the fair value of each of our other reporting units was substantially in excess of their respective carrying values as of the goodwill impairment test 
see note in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding closures and impairments recorded in  and  including the impairments of goodwill and other long lived assets 

table of contents insurance reserves 
we self insure a significant portion of expected losses under our workers compensation  general liability  employment practices liability and property insurance programs 
in addition  starting in fiscal  we self insure a significant portion of expected losses under our employee healthcare insurance program 
we purchase insurance for individual claims that exceed the amounts listed below employment practices liability workers compensation general liability property employee healthcare we record a liability for unresolved claims and for an estimate of incurred but not reported claims at the anticipated cost to us based on estimates provided by management  a third party administrator and or an actuary 
our estimated liability is based on a number of assumptions and factors regarding economic conditions  the frequency and severity of claims and claim development history and settlement practices 
an increase or decrease in the discount rate of basis points would change the reserve  and resulting expense  by an immaterial amount 
we also monitor actuarial observations of historical claim development for the industry 
our assumptions are reviewed  monitored  and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with asc under which deferred assets and liabilities are recognized based upon anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
a valuation allowance is established to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets if it is considered more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
any change in the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
uncertain tax positions are accounted for under fasb asc fasb asc requires that a position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not ie  a likelihood of more than fifty percent that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities that have full knowledge of all relevant information 
a recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon settlement 
leases and leasehold improvements 
we lease land  buildings and or certain equipment for the majority of our restaurants under non cancelable lease agreements 
our land and building leases typically have initial terms ranging from to years  and certain renewal options for one or more five year periods 
we account for leases in accordance with asc  leases  and other related authoritative guidance 
when determining the lease term  we include option periods for which failure to renew the lease imposes a penalty on us in such an amount that a renewal appears  at the inception of the lease  to be reasonably assured 
the primary penalty to which we are subject is the economic detriment associated with the existence of leasehold improvements which might become impaired if we choose not to continue the use of the leased property 
certain of our operating leases contain predetermined fixed escalations of the minimum rent during the original term of the lease 
for these leases  we recognize the related rent expense on a straight line basis over the lease term and record the difference between the amounts charged to operations and amounts paid as deferred rent 
we generally do not receive rent concessions or leasehold improvement incentives upon opening a restaurant that is subject to a lease 
we may receive rent holidays  which would begin on the possession date and end on the date construction of the restaurant begins  during which no cash rent payments are typically due under the terms of the lease 
rent holidays are included in the lease term when determining straight line rent expense 

table of contents additionally  certain of our operating leases contain clauses that provide for additional contingent rent based on a percentage of sales greater than certain specified target amounts 
we recognize contingent rent expense prior to the achievement of the specified target that triggers the contingent rent  provided achievement of the target is considered probable 
this may result in some variability in rent expense as a percentage of revenues over the term of the lease in restaurants where we pay contingent rent 
we make judgments regarding the probable term for each restaurant property lease  which can impact the classification and accounting for a lease as capital or operating  the rent holiday and or escalations in payments that are taken into consideration when calculating straight line rent and the term over which leasehold improvements for each restaurant are amortized 
these judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation  amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different assumed lease terms were used 
in an exposure draft issued in  the fasb  together with the international accounting standards board  has proposed a comprehensive set of changes in generally accepted accounting policies gaap for leases 
we are continuing to monitor the fasb and international accounting standards board s activities regarding leases and will disclose expected impacts on our business and financial statements as rules are finalized 
effects of inflation we believe inflation has had a negative effect on our restaurant profitability during the past few years as we have not substantially offset increases in our restaurant and operating costs resulting from inflation by altering our menu  increasing menu prices and or making other adjustments 
whether we are able and or choose to offset the effects of inflation will determine to what  if any  extent inflation affects our restaurant profitability in future periods 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on debt and changes in commodity prices 
our exposure to interest rate fluctuations is limited to our outstanding bank debt 
our options for the rate are the base rate  which is the higher of the issuing bank s prime lending rate or the federal funds rate plus  or libor plus an applicable margin 
at december   there was million in outstanding borrowings under our revolving line of credit  which bears interest at approximately to basis points depending on our leverage ratios over libor 
we had various other notes payable totaling million with fixed interest rates ranging from to on october   we entered into an interest rate swap  which started on november   with a notional amount of million to hedge a portion of the cash flows of our variable rate credit facility 
we have designated the interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge of our exposure to variability in future cash flows attributable to interest payments on a million tranche of floating rate debt borrowed under our revolving credit facility 
under the terms of the swap  we pay a fixed rate of on the million notional amount and receive payments from the counterparty based on the month libor rate for a term ending on november   effectively resulting in a fixed rate on the libor component of the million notional amount 
on january   we entered into another interest rate swap  starting february   with a notional amount of million to hedge a portion of the cash flows of our variable rate credit facility 
we have designated the interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge of our exposure to variability in future cash flows attributable to interest payments on a million tranche of floating rate debt borrowed under our revolving credit facility 
under the terms of the swap  we pay a fixed rate of on the million notional amount and receive payments from the counterparty based on the 
table of contents month libor rate for a term ending on january   effectively resulting in a fixed rate libor component of the million notional amount 
by using a derivative instrument to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates  we expose ourselves to credit risk 
credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract 
we minimize the credit risk by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties whose credit rating is evaluated on a quarterly basis 
our counterparty in the interest rate swap is jp morgan chase bank  na many of the ingredients used in the products sold in our restaurants are commodities that are subject to unpredictable price volatility 
there are no established fixed price markets for certain commodities such as produce and cheese  and we are subject to prevailing market conditions when purchasing those types of commodities 
for other commodities  we employ various purchasing and pricing contract techniques in an effort to minimize volatility  including fixed price contracts for terms of one year or less and negotiating prices with vendors with reference to fluctuating market prices 
we currently do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices  but we will continue to evaluate their effectiveness 
extreme and or long term increases in commodity prices could adversely affect our future results  especially if we are unable  primarily due to competitive reasons  to increase menu prices 
additionally  if there is a time lag between the increasing commodity prices and our ability to increase menu prices or if we believe the commodity price increase to be short in duration and we choose not to pass on the cost increases  our short term financial results could be negatively affected 
we are subject to business risk as our beef supply is highly dependent upon four vendors 
while we maintain relationships with additional suppliers  if any of these vendors were unable to fulfill its obligations under its contracts  we may encounter supply shortages and incur higher costs to secure adequate supplies  any of which would harm our business
