item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in note to our consolidated financial statements 
industry overview drug discovery and development is the process of creating drugs for the treatment of human disease 
the drug discovery process aims to identify potential drug candidates  while the drug development process involves the testing of these drug candidates in animals and humans to meet regulatory requirements 
discovering and developing new drugs is an extremely expensive  complex  high risk and time consuming process 
multiple industry sources estimate the fully capitalized cost of developing and commercializing a new pharmaceutical product ranges from million to over billion 
in addition  it generally takes between and years to develop a new prescription drug and obtain approval to market it in the united states 
the drug development services industry provides independent product development services to pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology companies  and government organizations 
this industry has evolved from providing limited clinical trial services in the s to a full service industry today characterized by broader relationships with clients and by service offerings that encompass the entire drug development process  including preclinical evaluations  study design  clinical trial management  data collection  biostatistical analyses  regulatory consulting  clinical laboratory and diagnostic services  pre and post approval safety analysis  product registration and post approval support 
over the past years  technological advances  as well as the emergence of the biotechnology industry  have dramatically changed the drug discovery process 
new and improved technologies have evolved such as ultra high throughput screening  new in vitro and in vivo preclinical profiling techniques and the gene based drug research commonly referred to as genomics 
the objective of these innovations is to find more drug targets and to screen chemical compounds against targets much more quickly  with literally millions of compounds possible 
this process is expected to produce many more molecules having the ability to affect biological activity 
these molecules then need to be tested quickly and economically to determine their viability as potentially safe and effective drug candidates 
trends affecting the drug discovery and development industry our services and products are marketed globally to pharmaceutical  medical research and biotechnology companies and institutions engaged in drug research and development 
the research services industry is highly fragmented among many niche vendors led by a small number of larger companies  the latter offer an ever growing portfolio of start to finish pharmaceutical development services 
our products are also marketed to academic and governmental institutions 
our services and products may have distinctly different clients often separate divisions in a single large pharmaceutical company and requirements 
we believe that all clients are facing increased pressure to outsource facets of their research and development activities and that the following factors will increase client outsourcing accelerated drug development clients continue to demand faster  more efficient  more selective development of an increasing pool of drug candidates 
consequently  our clients require fast  high quality service in order to make well informed decisions to quickly exclude poor candidates and speed development of successful ones 
the need for additional development capacity to exploit more opportunities  accelerate development  extend market exclusivity and increase profitability drives the demand for outsourced services 
increase in potential new drug candidates while research and development spending and the number of drug candidates are increasing  the time and cost required to develop a new drug candidate also have increased 
many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies do not have sufficient internal resources to pursue development of all of these new drug candidates on their own 
consequently  these companies are looking to the drug discovery and development services industry for cost effective  innovative and rapid means of developing new drugs 
cost pressures of introducing new drugs market forces  healthcare reform and other governmental initiatives place significant pressures on pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to reduce drug prices 
in addition  increased competition as a result of patent expiration  market acceptance of generic drugs  and governmental and privately managed care organization efforts to reduce healthcare costs have added to drug pricing pressures 
the industry is responding by consolidating  streamlining operations  decentralizing internal discovery and development processes  and minimizing fixed costs 
in addition  increased pressures to differentiate products and justify drug pricing are resulting in an increased focus on healthcare economics  safety monitoring and commercialization services 
moreover  pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are attempting to increase the speed and efficiency of internal new drug discovery and development processes 
patent expiration as exclusivity ends with patent expiry  drug companies defend their proprietary positions against generic competition with various patent extension strategies 
both the drug company creating these extensions and the generic competitors should provide additional opportunities for us 
alliances strategic alliances allow pharmaceutical companies to share research know how and to develop and market new drugs faster in more diverse  global markets 
we believe that such alliances will lead to a greater number of potential drugs in testing  many under study by small companies lacking broad technical resources 
those small companies can add shareholder value by further developing new products through outsourcing  reducing risk for potential allies 
clients seek realistic business partnerships with their service provider in an effort to ensure that costs are controlled as their development programs progress 
we have long standing business relationships with many pharmaceutical companies and continue to offer flexible services and adapt to our client s requirements 
mergers and acquisitions consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry is commonplace 
as firms blend personnel  resources and business activities  we believe they will continue to streamline operations and minimize staffing  which may lead to more outsourcing 
consolidation may result in a disruption in the progress of drug development programs as merging companies rationalize their respective drug development pipelines 
biotechnology industry and virtual drug company growth the us biotechnology industry has grown rapidly over the last decade and has emerged as a key client segment for the drug discovery and development services industry 
in recent years  this industry has generated significant numbers of new drug candidates that will require development and regulatory approval 
many biotechnology drug developers do not have in house resources to conduct development 
many new companies choose only to carry a product to a developed stage sufficient to attract a partner who will manufacture and market the drug 
because of the time and cost involved  these companies rely heavily on cros to conduct research for their drug candidates 
unique technical expertise the increasing complexity of new drugs requires highly specialized  innovative  solution driven research not available in all client labs 
we believe that this need for unique technical expertise will increasingly lead to outsourcing of research activity 
data management and quality expertise our clients and the fda require more data  greater access to that data  consistent and auditable management of that data  and greater security and control of that data 
we have made significant investments in software throughout our contract services groups to optimize efficiency and ensure compliance with fda regulations and market expectations 
changes in the regulatory environment the drug discovery and development process is heavily regulated by the fda and its center for drug evaluation and research 
recent product safety concerns  increases in drug and general healthcare costs and the emergence of importation issues have placed the fda and other regulatory agencies under increased scrutiny 
the war on terror  the risk of global vaccine shortages and the threat of new potential pandemics have elevated the fda s focus on research in the areas of bioterrorism and vaccine development 
as a result of these and other events  drug safety  cost and availability are under intense monitoring and review by congress  the fda and other government agencies 
in  primarily in response to the fda s handling of postmarket data and recent drug safety concerns  the fda act was signed into law 
in addition to reauthorizing and amending various provisions that were scheduled to expire  this act provided the fda with new regulatory authority to require drug sponsors to run post approval studies and clinical trials and develop and implement risk evaluation and mitigation strategies 
it is also likely that additional legislation will be passed that will impact the fda and drug development and approval process in the united states 
the fda act  continued drug safety issues and future legislation could have a lasting and pronounced impact on the drug discovery and development industry 
globalization of the marketplace foreign firms rely on independent development companies with experience in the us to provide integrated services through all phases of product development and to assist in preparing complex regulatory submissions 
domestic drug firms are broadening product availability globally  demanding local regulatory approval 
we believe that domestic service providers with global reach  established regulatory expertise  and a broad range of integrated development services will benefit from this trend 
our solution we address the needs of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries  as well as academic  non profit and government organizations  for drug discovery and development by providing integrated services to help our clients maximize the return on their research and development investments 
our application of innovative technologies and products and our commitment to quality throughout the drug discovery and development process offer our clients a way to identify and develop successful drugs and devices more quickly and cost effectively 
we have obtained significant drug development expertise from more than years of operation 
the company s role in the drug development process after a new drug candidate is identified and carried through preliminary screening  the development process for new drugs has three distinct phases 
the preclinical phase includes safety testing to prepare an investigational new drug ind application for submission to the fda 
the ind must be accepted by the fda before the drug can be tested in humans 
once a pharmacologically active molecule is fully analyzed to confirm its integrity  the initial dosage form for clinical trials is created 
an analytical chemistry method is developed to enable reliable quantification 
stability and purity of the formulation are also determined 
clients work with our preclinical services group to establish pharmacokinetics pk  pharmacodynamics pd and safety testing of the new drug 
these safety studies range from dose ranging studies  that involve acute safety monitoring of drugs and medical devices to chronic  multi year oncogenicity and reproductive toxicity studies 
dose formulation analysis is provided by our pharmaceutical analysis group 
bioanalyses of blood sampled under these protocols by our bioanalytical services group provide pharmacokinetic and metabolism data that is used with the safety and toxicity information to determine the exposure required to demonstrate toxicity 
a no effect level is then established for the drug and sets the basis for future dose levels in further safety testing and clinical phase i studies 
upon successful completion of preclinical safety studies  an ind submission is prepared and provided to the fda for review prior to human clinical trials 
many of our products are designed for use in discovery and preclinical development 
the culex family of robotic automated dose delivery and blood and other biofluids sampling and physiological parameters measurement systems enable researchers to quickly and cost effectively determine pk pd profiles of drugs in large and small animal models 
the culex system allows experiments on freely moving conscious animals from early research for therapeutic target validation to lead optimization of compounds 
using the culex system  researchers are able to automatically dose and sample in vivo to develop pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of drugs during early screening in rodents and other animals quickly and cost effectively 
our bioanalytical services group utilizes our depth of expertise in liquid chromatography with detection by mass spectrometry to support research  preclinical and clinical programs 
we also offer bioanalytical services that utilize electrochemistry  spectrophotometric uv vis or fluorescence and corona discharge detection as options 
we have invested heavily in robotics and mass spectrometry systems 
application of this technology allows us to rapidly develop and validate methods for new compounds and obtain information suitable for regulatory submission 
the clinical phase further explores the safety and efficacy of the drug candidate in humans 
the sponsor conducts phase i human clinical trials in a limited number of healthy individuals to determine safety and tolerability 
bioanalytical assays determine the availability and metabolism of the active ingredient following administration 
expertise in method development and validation is critical  particularly for new chemical entities 
exhaustive safety  tolerability and dosing regimens are established in sick patients in phase ii trials 
phase iii clinical trials verify efficacy and safety 
after successful completion of phase iii trials  the sponsor of the new drug submits a new drug application nda or product license application pla to the fda requesting that the product be approved for marketing 
early manufacturing demonstrates production of the substance in accordance with fda good manufacturing practices gmp guidelines 
data are compiled in an nda  or for biotechnology products a pla  for submission to the fda requesting approval to market the drug or product 
the bioanalytical sample count per study grows rapidly from phase i through phase iii 
phase ii and iii studies may take several years to complete  supported by well proven  consistently applied analytical methods 
our services include evaluation of bioequivalence and bioavailability to monitor the rate and extent to which a drug is available in the body and to demonstrate that the availability is consistent between formulations 
we also offer in vitro bioequivalence testing for non absorbed oral drugs 
we offer support and testing services in clinical sample development  release and stability 
the post approval phase follows fda approval of the nda or pla 
this includes production and continued analytical and clinical monitoring of the drug 
the post approval phase also includes development and regulatory approval of product modifications and line extensions  including improved dosage forms 
the drug manufacturer must comply with quality assurance and quality control requirements throughout production and must continue analytical and stability studies of the drug during commercial production to continue to validate production processes and confirm product shelf life 
samples from each manufactured batch must be tested prior to release of the batch for distribution to the public 
we also provide services in all areas during the post approval phase  including bioequivalence studies of new formulations  line extensions  new disease indications and drug interaction studies 
our ability to offer gmp electrochemical detection services has provided increased business opportunities for release testing 
the increases in our services offerings have resulted in our ability to provide a broader range of services to our clients  often using combined services of several disciplines to address client needs 
our ability to solve client problems by combining our knowledge base  services and products has been a factor in our selection by major pharmaceutical companies to assist in several preclinical through the post approval phases 
company services and products overview we focus on developing innovative services and products that increase efficiency and reduce costs associated with taking new drugs to market 
we operate in two business segments contract research services and research products  both of which address the bioanalytical  preclinical  and clinical research needs of drug developers 
both segments arose out of our expertise in a number of core technologies designed to quantify trace chemicals in complex matrices 
services the contract research services segment provides screening and pharmacological testing  preclinical safety testing  formulation development  regulatory compliance and quality control testing 
revenues from the services segment were million for fiscal the following is a description of the services provided by our contract research services segment product characterization  method development and validation analytical methods  primarily performed in west lafayette  indiana  determine potency  purity  chemical composition  structure and physical properties of a compound 
methods are validated to ensure that data generated are accurate  precise  reproducible and reliable and are used consistently throughout the drug development process and in later product support 
bioanalytical testing we analyze specimens from preclinical and clinical trials to measure drug and metabolite concentrations in complex biological matrices 
bioanalysis is performed at our facilities in west lafayette  indiana 
stability testing we test stability of drug substances and formulated drug products and maintain secure storage facilities in west lafayette  indiana to establish and confirm product purity  potency and shelf life 
we have multiple international conference on harmonization validated controlled climate gmp good manufacturing practices systems in place  and the testing capability to complete most stability programs 
in vivo pharmacology we provide preclinical in vivo sampling services for the continuous monitoring of chemical changes in life  in particular  how a drug enters  travels through  and is metabolized in living systems 
most services are performed in customized facilities in west lafayette and evansville  indiana using our robotic culex aps automated pharmacology system system 
preclinical and pathology services we provide pharmacokinetic and safety testing in studies ranging from acute safety monitoring of drugs and medical devices to chronic  multi year oncogenicity studies in our evansville  indiana site 
depending on protocol  multiple tissues may be collected to monitor pathological changes 
research products we focus our products business on expediting preclinical screening of developmental drugs 
we compete in small niches of the multibillion dollar analytical instrument industry 
the products business targets unique niches in life science research 
we design  develop  manufacture and market state of the art in vivo sampling systems and accessories including disposables  training and systems qualification physiology monitoring tools liquid chromatography and electrochemistry instruments platforms revenues for our products segment were million for fiscal we offer three principal product lines analytical products  in vivo sampling products and vetronics products 
the following is a brief description of the products offered analytical products the analytical products consist of our liquid chromatographic and electrochemical instruments with associated accessories 
the critical component of these products is the epsilon electrochemical platform 
this incorporates all the hardware capabilities needed for most electrochemical experiments but can be modified through software development 
the market is principally academic institutions and industrial research companies 
in vivo sampling products the in vivo sampling products consist of the culex family of automated in vivo sampling and dosing instruments 
these are used by pharmaceutical researchers to dose animals and collect biological samples blood  bile  urine  microdialysate  feces or any bio fluid from the animals 
since dosing and sample collections are automated  animals are not manually handled  reducing stress on the animals and producing more representative pharmacological data 
behavior and other physiological parameters can also be monitored simultaneously 
compared to manual methods  the culex products offer significant reduction in test model use and comparable reduction in labor 
the line also includes miniaturized in vivo sampling devices sold to drug developers and medical research centers to assist in the study of a number of medical conditions including stroke  depression  alzheimer s and parkinson s diseases  diabetes and osteoporosis 
vetronics products the vetronics products consist of instruments and related software to monitor and diagnose cardiac function electro cardiogram and measure other vital physiological parameters primarily in cats and dogs in veterinary clinics 
clients over the past five years  we have regularly provided our services and or products to most of the top pharmaceutical companies in the world  as ranked by the number of research and development projects 
approximately of our revenues are generated from customers outside of north america 
we balance our business development effort between large pharmaceutical developers and smaller drug development companies 
the preferred provider agreement ppa with pharmasset  inc expired under its own terms  though they remain a large client of the company 
pharmasset  inc  now known as gilead sciences  inc 
gilead via acquisition  accounted for approximately and of our total revenues in fiscal and  respectively  and and of total trade accounts receivable at september  and  respectively 
pfizer  inc remains a large client  accounting for approximately and of our total revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
pfizer  inc accounted for and of total trade accounts receivable at september  and  respectively 
there can be no assurance that our business will not continue to be dependent on continued relationships with gilead and pfizer  inc or other clients  or that annual results will not be dependent on a few large projects 
in addition  there can be no assurance that significant clients in any one period will continue to be significant clients in other periods 
in any given year  there is a possibility that a single pharmaceutical company may account for or more of our total revenue 
since we do not have long term contracts with most of our clients  the importance of a single client may vary dramatically from year to year 
sales and marketing with a primary focus on both large and small pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  we promote our services through concentrated business development efforts  scientist to scientist communications and centralized corporate marketing programs 
we recognize that our growth and customer satisfaction depend upon our ability to continually improve and create new client relationships 
our sales and global marketing initiatives include integrated campaigns designed to help differentiate and promote our products and services 
through trade events  online and print advertising in trade publications  direct communication  newsletters  and our website  we provide our perspective on current industry challenges or developments to create an ongoing dialogue with our clients and to promote our industry expertise  quality  technology and innovation 
we reinforce key messages and selling points through client presentations  corporate material  at trade events and industry conferences 
we encourage and sponsor the participation of our scientific and technical personnel in a variety of professional endeavors  including speaking and the presentation of papers at national and international professional trade meetings and the publication of scientific articles in medical and pharmaceutical journals 
through these presentations and publications  we seek to further our reputation for professional excellence 
we currently have employees on our global sales and marketing staff 
we have a network of established distributors covering japan  the pacific basin  south america  the middle east  india  south africa and eastern europe 
all of our distributor relationships are managed from the corporate headquarters in west lafayette  indiana 
contractual arrangements our service contracts typically establish an estimated fee to be paid for identified services 
in most cases  some percentage of the contract costs is paid in advance 
while we are performing a contract  clients often adjust the scope of services to be provided based on interim project results 
fees are adjusted accordingly 
generally  our fee for service contracts are terminable by the client upon written notice of days or less for a variety of reasons  including the client s decision to forego a particular study  the failure of product prototypes to satisfy safety requirements  and unexpected or undesired results of product testing 
cancellation or delay of ongoing contracts may result in fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results 
we are generally able to recover at least our invested costs when contracts are terminated 
our products business offers annual service and maintenance agreements on most product lines 
backlog the contracts pursuant to which we provide our services are terminable upon written notice of days or less 
we maintain projections based on bids and contracts to optimize asset utilization 
we have increased the use of sales forecasts in manufacturing our products  with the result that we rarely have a significant backlog for products 
for services  backlog generally includes work to be performed under signed agreements ie  contracts and letters of intent 
once work under a signed agreement begins  net revenues are recognized over the life of the project 
some of our studies and projects are performed over an extended period of time  which may exceed several years 
we maintain an order backlog to track anticipated net revenues yet to be earned for work that has not been performed 
although backlog can provide meaningful information to our management with respect to a particular study  we believe that our backlog for services as of any date is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of our future results for a variety of reasons 
studies vary in duration  the scope of studies may change  which may either increase or decrease their value  and studies may be terminated  or delayed at any time by the client or regulatory authorities 
competition services we compete with in house research  development  quality control and other support service departments of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
there are also full service contract research organizations cros that compete in this industry 
several of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources than we do 
the largest cro competitors offering similar research services include covance  inc  pharmaceutical product development  inc  charles river laboratories  inc  parexel  and mds health group ltd 
cros generally compete on regulatory compliance record  reputation for on time quality performance quality system  previous experience  medical and scientific expertise in specific therapeutic areas  scientist to scientist relationships  quality of contract research  financial viability  database management  statistical and regulatory services  ability to recruit investigators  ability to integrate information technology with systems to optimize research efficiency  quality of facilities  an international presence with strategically located facilities  and price 
products founded as a provider of instrumentation and products utilized in life and physical sciences research laboratories  we continue to serve these product niches today 
though many global analytical instruments competitors exist  we have an extensive  long standing network of customers who are repeat buyers and recommend our products 
in contrast  there are few competitors for our in vivo sampling products 
the primary market is large pharmaceutical research departments 
our differentiators are high quality  flexibility to meet customers specific needs and superior technical support and service 
we provide equipment that enables our customers to attain premium scientific laboratory information on a reasonable operating investment 
as customers needs constantly change  we continually invest in the refinement of our products and in new product opportunities that meet our operating objectives 
government regulation we are subject to various regulatory requirements designed to ensure the quality and integrity of our data and products 
these regulations are promulgated primarily under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  and include good laboratory practice glp  good manufacturing practice gmp  and good clinical practice gcp guidelines administered by the fda 
the standards of glp  gmp  and gcp are required by the fda and by similar regulatory authorities around the world 
these guidelines demand rigorous attention to employee training  detailed documentation  equipment validation  careful tracking of changes and routine auditing of compliance 
noncompliance with these standards could result in disqualification of project data collected by the company 
material violation of glp  gmp  or gcp guidelines could result in regulatory sanctions and  in severe cases  could also result in a discontinuance of selected operations 
since october  we have been audited  on a routine basis  by the fda and uk s mhra twenty times 
the fda has visited seven times in west lafayette  three times each at the oregon and evansville locations and twice at the uk location 
mhra has visited the uk facility five times 
of the fifteen fda audits  seven were without findings 
where the fda had findings  which have not been significant to our operations  we have taken actions to address the findings 
the uk facility was found to be compliant with glp and gcp 
we have not experienced any significant problems to date in complying with the regulations of such agencies and do not believe that any existing or proposed regulations will require material capital expenditures or changes in our method of operation 
analytical services laboratories that provide information included in inds  ndas and plas must conform to regulatory requirements that are designed to ensure the quality and integrity of the testing process 
most of our contract research services are subject to government standards for laboratory practices that are embodied in guidelines for glp 
the fda and other regulatory authorities require that test results submitted to such authorities be based on studies conducted in accordance with glp 
these guidelines are set out to help the researcher perform work in compliance with a pre established plan and standardized procedures 
these guidelines include but are not restricted to resources organization  personnel  facilities and equipment rules protocols and written procedures characterization test items and test systems documentation raw data  final report and archives quality assurance unit formalized internal audit function we must also maintain reports for each study for specified periods for auditing by the study sponsor and by the fda or similar regulatory authorities in other parts of the world 
noncompliance with glp can result in the disqualification of data collected during the preclinical trial 
preclinical services our animal research facilities are subject to a variety of federal and state laws and regulations  including the animal welfare act and the rules and regulations enforced by the united states department of agriculture usda and the national institutes of health nih 
these regulations establish the standards for the humane treatment  care and handling of animals by dealers and research facilities 
our animal research facilities maintain detailed standard operating procedures and other documentation necessary to comply with applicable regulations for the humane treatment of the animals in our custody 
besides being licensed by the usda as a research facility  we are also accredited by the association for assessment and accreditation of laboratory animal care international aaalac and have registered assurance with the nih 
quality assurance and information technology to assure compliance with applicable regulations  we have established quality assurance programs at our facilities that audit test data  train personnel and review procedures and regularly inspect facilities 
in addition  fda regulations and guidelines serve as a basis for our standard operating procedures sops where applicable 
on an ongoing basis  we endeavor to standardize sops across all relevant operations 
in addition  we have both developed and purchased software to ensure compliant documentation  handling and reporting of laboratory generated study data 
in fiscal  we purchased cfr part fda guidelines on electronic records and electronic signatures that define the criteria under which electronic records and electronic signatures are considered to be trustworthy  reliable and equivalent to paper records compliant software for our preclinical research group 
at the end of fiscal  our contract research operations were compliant with applicable us fda regulations including cfr part in our analytical  bioanalytical  toxicology  lab information management  and document management systems 
systems compliant with cfr part were formally validated and released for use in regulated studies 
we manage our business systems through the use of an enterprise resource planning erp system 
we are continually refining and adjusting our erp system to improve efficiency  provide better management tools and address changes in our business 
these changes are appropriately documented and tested before implementation 
we also test these systems in connection with management s annual review of our internal control systems 
management s assessment and report on internal controls over financial reporting is included in item a 
controlled  hazardous  and environmentally threatening substances some of our development and testing activities are subject to the controlled substances act administered by the drug enforcement agency dea  which strictly regulates all narcotic and habit forming substances 
we maintain restricted access facilities and heightened control procedures for projects involving such substances due to the level of security and other controls required by the dea 
in addition  we are subject to other federal and state regulations concerning such matters as occupational safety and health and protection of the environment 
our laboratories are subject to licensing and regulation under federal  state and local laws relating to hazard communication and employee right to know regulations  the handling and disposal of medical specimens and hazardous waste  as well as the safety and health of laboratory employees 
all of our laboratories are subject to applicable federal and state laws and regulations relating to the storage and disposal of all laboratory specimens  including the regulations of the environmental protection agency  the department of transportation  the national fire protection agency and the resource conservation and recovery act 
although we believe that we are currently in compliance in all material respects with such federal  state and local laws  failure to comply could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business  fines  criminal penalties and other enforcement actions 
the regulations of the us department of transportation  the us public health service and the us postal service apply to the surface and air transportation of laboratory specimens 
our laboratories also comply with the international air transport association regulations which govern international shipments of laboratory specimens 
furthermore  when materials are sent to a foreign country  the transportation of such materials becomes subject to the laws  rules and regulations of such foreign country 
safety in addition to comprehensive regulation of safety in the workplace  the occupational safety and health administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for health care employers whose workers may be exposed to blood borne pathogens such as hiv and the hepatitis b virus 
these regulations  among other things  require work practice controls  protective clothing and equipment  training  medical follow up  vaccinations and other measures designed to minimize exposure to chemicals  and transmission of blood borne and airborne pathogens 
furthermore  relevant employees receive initial and periodic training focusing on compliance with applicable hazardous materials regulations and health and safety guidelines 
hipaa the us department of health and human services has promulgated final regulations under the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa that govern the disclosure of confidential medical information in the united states 
we have had a global privacy policy in place since january and believe that we are in compliance with the current european union and hipaa requirements 
we continue to monitor our compliance with these regulations  and we intend to take appropriate steps to ensure compliance as these and other privacy regulations are revised or come into effect 
product liability and insurance we maintain product liability and professional errors and omissions liability insurance  providing approximately million in coverage on a claims made basis 
additionally  in certain circumstances  we seek to manage our liability risk through contractual provisions to be indemnified by the client or covered by the client s liability insurance policies 
also  in certain types of engagements  we seek to limit our contractual liability to clients to the amount of fees received 
the contractual arrangements are subject to negotiation with clients  and the terms and scope of such indemnification  liability limitation and insurance coverage vary by client and project 
research and development in fiscal and  we spent and  respectively  on research and development 
separate from our contract research services business  we maintain applications research and development to enhance our products business 
expenditures cover hardware and software engineering costs  laboratory supplies  labor  prototype development and laboratory demonstrations of new products and applications for those products 
intellectual property we believe that our patents  trademarks  copyrights and other proprietary rights are important to our business 
accordingly  we actively seek protection for those rights both in the united states and abroad 
where we deem it to be an appropriate course of action  we will vigorously prosecute patent infringements 
we do not believe  however  that the loss of any one of our patents  trademarks  copyrights or other proprietary rights would be material to our consolidated revenues or earnings 
we currently hold three federally registered trademarks 
we also have two pending patents  one on the dried blood spot dbs sampling card for the culex automated blood sampling instrumentation and the second for the no blood waste technology also for the culex instrument 
the former dbs reduces the cost of bio sample collection  shipment and storage and the latter is important for the precise sampling of bio fluids of very small volume from animals such as mice 
we also generate client value through continuing client support  hardware and software upgrades  system reliability and accuracy 
in addition to these formal intellectual property rights  we rely on trade secrets  unpatented know how and continuing applications research which we seek to protect through means of reasonable business procedures  such as confidentiality agreements 
we believe that the greatest value that we generate for our clients comes from these trade secrets  know how and applications research 
raw materials there are no specialized raw materials that are particularly essential to our business 
we have a variety of alternative suppliers for our essential components 
employees at september   we had full time employees and part time employees 
all employees enter into confidentiality agreements intended to protect our proprietary information 
we believe that our relations with our employees are good 
none of our employees are represented by a labor union 
our performance depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified professional  scientific and technical staff 
the level of competition among employers for skilled personnel is high 
we believe that our employee benefit plans enhance employee morale  professional commitment and work productivity and provide an incentive for employees to remain with the company

if any of the events or circumstances described below occurs  our business and financial performance could be adversely affected  our actual results could differ materially from our expectations and the market value of our stock could decline 
the risks and uncertainties discussed below are not the only ones we face 
there may be additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material that may adversely affect our business and financial performance 
if we fail to meet our current debt covenants  refinance our existing indebtedness or extend the maturity date of our loans with regions bank  our business and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
we have notes payable to regions bank regions that are secured by mortgages on our facilities in west lafayette and evansville  indiana 
we also have a line of credit with entrepreneur growth capital llc egc and together with regions  the lenders 
borrowings under the egc credit agreement are secured by a blanket lien on our personal property  including certain eligible accounts receivable  inventory  and intellectual property assets  a second mortgage on our west lafayette and evansville  indiana real estate  and all common stock of our us subsidiaries and of the common stock of our non united states subsidiary 
the regions loans contain cross default provisions with each other and with the revolving line of credit with egc 
the egc credit agreement also contains cross default provisions with the regions loans and any future egc loans 
the agreements governing the regions and egc indebtedness include certain financial covenants with which we must comply each quarter  including a fixed charge coverage and a tangible net worth covenant 
a breach of any of these covenants or our inability to comply with any required financial ratios could result in a default under one or more credit agreements  unless we are able to obtain the necessary waivers or amendments to the credit agreements 
upon the occurrence of an event of default that is not waived  and subject to any appropriate cure periods  the lenders under the affected credit agreements could elect to exercise any of their available remedies  which may include the right to not lend any additional amounts to us or  in certain instances  to declare all outstanding borrowings  together with accrued interest and other fees  to be immediately due and payable 
if we are unable to repay the borrowings with respect to such credit facility when due  the lenders would be permitted to proceed against their collateral 
in addition  egc could refuse to make further advances to us under our line of credit 
if the lenders take any or all of these steps  our operating results and financial condition will be materially adversely affected and we may be unable to continue to fund our operations 
the regions loans originally matured on november  we secured an extension of that maturity date to october  all amounts due under this credit facility are due and payable on the maturity date 
we are pursuing alternatives to refinance the regions indebtedness  including borrowing from another lending institution and a sale and leaseback of our west lafayette  indiana building 
in the event we are unable to refinance or extend the maturity of our existing indebtedness  our lenders would be entitled to exercise remedies against us  including their right to foreclose or otherwise enforce their mortgage liens and security interests in our assets 
if the lender takes any or all of these steps  our operating results and financial condition will be materially adversely affected and we may be unable to continue to fund our operations 
the decline in our revenues has reduced the amount of cash provided by our operating activities and we have limited ability to raise additional cash 
we depend on cash generated by our operations and borrowings on our line of credit to fund our business operations 
the decline in our revenue during fiscal contributed to a decrease in our cash flow fron operations and a reduction in our borrowing capacity under our revolving line of credit  reducing liquidity 
substantially all of our assets are encumbered as security for our existing indebtedness 
it could be difficult to raise additional debt without additional collateral for security 
there is also a limited market for our common shares  which could make it difficult to issue additional equity 
it could therefore be difficult to raise additional cash if our revolving line of credit and operations do not generate sufficient cash to fund our operations 
we have experienced periods of losses on our operating activities 
our overall strategy includes increasing revenue and reducing controlling operating expenses 
we have concentrated our efforts in ongoing  company wide efficiency activities intended to increase productivity and reduce costs including personnel reductions  reduction or elimination of non personnel expenses and realigning and streamlining operations 
we cannot assure that our efforts will result in any increased profitability  or if our efforts result in profit  that profits will continue  for any meaningful period of time 
we rely on a limited number of key customers and a loss of one or more of these key customers will adversely affect our operating results 
two customers account for approximately of our total revenue in fiscal and of our total revenues in fiscal our agreement with one of those large customers that required the customer to use us as their preferred provider for toxicology services expired on july  although the parties continue to operate under substantially the same economic terms and conditions as are set forth in the preferred provider agreement  neither we nor our customer are obliged to do so 
the loss of a significant amount of business from one of our major customers would materially and adversely affect our results of operations until such time  if ever  as we are able to replace the lost business 
dependence on a small number of customers could make it difficult for us to negotiate attractive prices for our products 
moreover  to the extent that we are dependent on any single customer  we are subject to the risks faced by that customer to the extent that such risks impede the customer s ability to stay in business and make timely payments to us 
the majority of our customers contracts can be terminated upon short notice 
most of our contracts for cro services are terminable by the client upon days notice 
clients terminate or delay their contracts for a variety of reasons  including but not limited to products being tested fail to satisfy safety requirements  products have undesired clinical results  the client decides to forego a particular study  inability to enroll enough patients in the study  inability to recruit enough investigators  production problems cause shortages of the drug  and actions by regulatory authorities 
the loss  reduction in scope or delay of a large contract or the loss or delay of multiple contracts could materially adversely affect our business  although our contracts frequently entitle us to receive the costs of winding down the terminated projects  as well as all fees earned by us up to the time of termination 
some contracts also entitle us to a termination fee 
we may bear financial risk if we underprice our contracts or overrun cost estimates 
since some of our contracts are structured as fixed price or fee for service  we bear the financial risk if we initially underprice our contracts or otherwise overrun our cost estimates 
such underpricing or significant cost overruns could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
a reduction in research and development budgets at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may adversely affect our business 
our customers include researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
our ability to continue to grow and win new business is dependent in large part upon the ability and willingness of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries to continue to spend on research and development and to outsource the products and services we provide 
fluctuations in the research and development budgets of these researchers and their organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services 
research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources  mergers of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  spending priorities and institutional budgetary policies 
our business could be adversely affected by any significant decrease in life sciences research and development expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
similarly  economic factors and industry trends that affect our clients in these industries also affect our business 
in recent years  we have seen evidence that suggests that many customers have reduced their research and development budgets 
we believe that this is in connection with the general economic slowdown and consolidation in our target industry 
while this condition continues  our revenues may be negatively impacted 
our future success depends on our ability to keep pace with rapid technological changes that could make our services and products less competitive or obsolete 
the biotechnology  pharmaceutical and medical device industries generally  and contract research services more specifically  are subject to increasingly rapid technological changes 
our competitors or others might develop technologies  services or products that are more effective or commercially attractive than our current or future technologies  services or products  or that render our technologies  services or products less competitive or obsolete 
if competitors introduce superior technologies  services or products and we cannot make enhancements to ours to remain competitive  our competitive position  and in turn our business  revenues and financial condition  would be materially and adversely affected 
hardware or software failures  delays in the operations of our computer and communications systems or the failure to implement system enhancements could harm our business 
our success depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications systems 
a failure of our network or data gathering procedures could impede the processing of data  delivery of databases and services  client orders and day to day management of our business and could result in the corruption or loss of data 
while some of our operations have disaster recovery plans in place  they might not adequately protect us 
despite any precautions we take  damage from fire  floods  hurricanes  power loss  telecommunications failures  computer viruses  break ins and similar events at our computer facilities could result in interruptions in the flow of data to our servers and from our servers to our clients 
in addition  any failure by our computer environment to provide our required data communications capacity could result in interruptions in our service 
in the event of a delay in the delivery of data  we could be required to transfer our data collection operations to an alternative provider of server hosting services 
such a transfer could result in delays in our ability to deliver our products and services to our clients 
additionally  significant delays in the planned delivery of system enhancements  improvements and inadequate performance of the systems once they are completed could damage our reputation and harm our business 
finally  long term disruptions in the infrastructure caused by events such as natural disasters  the outbreak of war  the escalation of hostilities and acts of terrorism  particularly involving cities in which we have offices  could adversely affect our businesses 
although we carry property and business interruption insurance  our coverage might not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur 
we operate in a highly competitive industry 
the cro services industry is highly competitive 
we often compete for business not only with other  often larger and better capitalized  cro companies  but also with internal discovery and development departments within our clients  some of which are large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies with greater resources than we have 
if we do not compete successfully  our business will suffer 
the industry is highly fragmented  with numerous smaller specialized companies and a handful of full service companies with global capabilities much larger than ours 
increased competition might lead to price and other forms of competition that might adversely affect our operating results 
as a result of competitive pressures  our industry experienced consolidation in recent years 
this trend is likely to produce more competition among the larger companies for both clients and acquisition candidates 
the loss of our key personnel could adversely affect our business 
our success depends to a significant extent upon the efforts of our senior management team and other key personnel 
the loss of the services of such personnel could adversely affect our business 
also  because of the nature of our business  our success is dependent upon our ability to attract  train  manage and retain technologically qualified personnel 
there is substantial competition for qualified personnel  and an inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel may impact our ability to grow our business and compete effectively in our industry 
in particular  during fiscal  we experienced substantial turnover throughout our organization due to our restructuring efforts 
our chief executive officer and vice president of business development and marketing resigned and the senior vice presidents of the instruments division and human resources retired during the current fiscal year 
we also replaced our chief financial officer earlier in the year 
we are currently evaluating and rebuilding our organization 
there is no assurance that our efforts will be successful 
any failure by us to comply with existing regulations could harm our reputation and operating results 
any failure on our part to comply with existing regulations could result in the termination of ongoing research or the disqualification of data for submission to regulatory authorities 
for example  if we were to fail to properly monitor compliance with study protocols  the data collected could be disqualified 
if this were to happen  we may be contractually required to repeat a study at no further cost to the customer  but at substantial cost to us 
this would harm our reputation  our prospects for future work and our operating results 
furthermore  the issuance of a notice from the fda based on a finding of a material violation by us of good clinical practice  good laboratory practice or good manufacturing practice requirements could materially and adversely affect our business and financial performance 
our business uses biological and hazardous materials  which could injure people or violate laws  resulting in liability that could adversely impact our financial condition and business 
our activities involve the controlled use of potentially harmful biological materials  as well as hazardous materials  chemicals and various radioactive compounds 
we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from the use  storage  handling or disposal of these materials 
in the event of contamination or injury  we could be held liable for damages that result  and any liability could exceed our insurance coverage and ability to pay 
any contamination or injury could also damage our reputation  which is critical to getting new business 
in addition  we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  storage  handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products 
the cost of compliance with these laws and regulations is significant and if changes are made to impose additional requirements  these costs could increase and have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
our products business depends on our intellectual property 
our products business is dependent  in part  on our ability to obtain patents in various jurisdictions on our current and future technologies and products  to defend our patents and protect our trade secrets and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others 
there can be no assurance that our patents will not be challenged by third parties or that  if challenged  those patents will be held valid 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any technologies or products developed by us will not be challenged by third parties owning patent rights and  if challenged  will be held not to infringe on those patent rights 
the expense involved in any patent litigation can be significant 
we also rely on unpatented proprietary technology  and there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop or obtain similar products or technologies 
we might incur substantial expense to develop products that are never successfully commercialized 
we have incurred and expect to continue to incur substantial research and development and other expenses in connection with our products business 
the potential products to which we devote resources might never be successfully developed or commercialized by us for numerous reasons  including inability to develop products that address our customers needs  competitive products with superior performance  patent conflicts or unenforceable intellectual property rights  demand for the particular product  and other factors that could make the product uneconomical 
incurring significant expenses for a potential product that is not successfully developed and or commercialized could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  prospects and stock price 
providing cro services creates a risk of liability 
in certain circumstances  we seek to manage our liability risk through contractual provisions with clients requiring us to be indemnified by the clients or covered by the clients product liability insurance policies 
although most of our clients are large  well capitalized companies  the financial performance of these indemnities is not secured 
therefore  we bear the risk that the indemnifying party may not have the financial ability to fulfill its indemnification obligations or the liability would exceed the amount of applicable insurance 
furthermore  we could be held liable for errors and omissions in connection with the services we perform 
there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will be adequate  or that insurance coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms  or that we can obtain indemnification arrangements or otherwise be able to limit our liability risk 
we may expand our business through acquisitions 
we occasionally review acquisition candidates and acquisitions which we have already made 
factors which may affect our ability to grow successfully through acquisitions include inability to obtain financing  difficulties and expenses in connection with integrating the acquired companies and achieving the expected benefits  diversion of management s attention from current operations  the possibility that we may be adversely affected by risk factors facing the acquired companies  acquisitions could be dilutive to earnings  or in the event of acquisitions made through the issuance of our common stock to the shareholders of the acquired company  dilutive to the percentage of ownership of our existing stockholders  potential losses resulting from undiscovered liabilities of acquired companies not covered by the indemnification we may obtain from the seller  and loss of key employees of the acquired companies 
changes in government regulation or in practices relating to the pharmaceutical industry could change the need for the services we provide 
governmental agencies throughout the world  but particularly in the united states  strictly regulate the drug development process 
our business involves helping pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies comply with the regulatory drug approval process 
changes in regulation  such as a relaxation in regulatory requirements or the introduction of simplified drug approval procedures  or an increase in regulatory requirements that we have difficulty satisfying  or that make our services less competitive  could substantially change the demand for our services 
also  if the government increases efforts to contain drug costs and pharmaceutical and biotechnology company profits from new drugs  our customers may spend less  or reduce their growth in spending on research and development 
privacy regulations could increase our costs or limit our services 
the us department of health and human services has issued regulations under the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa 
these regulations demand greater patient privacy and confidentiality 
some state governments are considering more stringent regulations 
these regulations might require us to increase our investment in security or limit the services we offer 
we could be found legally liable if we fail to meet existing or proposed regulation on privacy and security of health information 
we may be affected by health care reform 
in march  the united states congress enacted health care reform legislation intended over time to expand health insurance coverage and impose health industry cost containment measures 
this legislation may significantly impact the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries 
in addition  the us congress  various state legislatures and european and asian governments may consider various types of health care reform in order to control growing health care costs 
we are presently uncertain as to the effects of the recently enacted legislation on our business and are unable to predict what legislative proposals will be adopted in the future  if any 
implementation of health care reform legislation may have certain benefits but also may contain costs that could limit the profits that can be made from the development of new drugs 
this could adversely affect research and development expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  which could in turn decrease the business opportunities available to us both in the united states and abroad 
in addition  new laws or regulations may create a risk of liability  increase our costs or limit our service offerings 
we rely on air transportation to serve our customers 
our laboratories and certain of our other businesses are heavily reliant on air travel for transport of samples and other material  products and people 
a significant disruption to the air travel system  or our access to it  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we depend on the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries 
over the past several years  some areas of our businesses have grown significantly as a result of the increase in pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies outsourcing their preclinical and clinical research support activities 
we believe that due to the significant investment in facilities and personnel required to support drug development  pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies look to outsource some or all of those services 
by doing so  they can focus their resources on their core competency of drug discovery  while obtaining the outsourced services from a full service provider like us 
our revenues depend greatly on the expenditures made by these pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in research and development 
in some instances  companies in these industries are reliant on their ability to raise capital in order to fund their research and development projects 
accordingly  economic factors and industry trends that affect our clients in these industries also affect our business 
if companies in these industries were to reduce the number of research and development projects they conduct or outsource  our business could be materially adversely affected 
unfavorable general economic conditions may materially adversely affect our business 
unfavorable global economic conditions  including the recent recession in the united states and the recent financial crisis affecting the banking system and financial markets  could negatively affect our business 
while it is difficult for us to predict the impact of general economic conditions on our business  these conditions could reduce customer demand for some of our services  which could cause our revenue to decline 
also  our customers  particularly smaller biotechnology companies which are especially reliant on the credit and capital markets  may not be able to obtain adequate access to credit or equity funding  which could affect their ability to make timely payments to us 
moreover  we rely on credit facilities to provide working capital to support our operations 
we regularly evaluate alternative financing sources 
further changes in the commercial credit market or in the financial stability of our creditors may impact the ability of our creditors to provide additional financing 
in addition  the financial condition of our credit facility providers  which is beyond our control  may adversely change 
any decrease in our access to borrowings under our credit facility  tightening of lending standards and other changes to our sources of liquidity could adversely impact our ability to obtain the financing we need to continue operating the business in our current manner 
for these reasons  among others  if the economic conditions stagnate or decline  our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
risks related to share ownership our share price could be volatile and our trading volume may fluctuate substantially 
the market price of our common stock has historically experienced and might continue to experience volatility 
many factors could have a significant impact on the future price of our common shares  including our failure to successfully implement our business objectives  compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements  market acceptance of our products  technological innovations  new commercial products or drug discovery efforts and preclinical and clinical activities by us or our competitors  changes in government regulations  general economic conditions and other external factors  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial and operating results  the degree of trading liquidity in our common shares  and our ability to meet the minimum standards required for remaining listed on the nasdaq capital market 
these factors also include ones beyond our control  such as market conditions within our industry and changes in pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries 
in addition  in recent years  the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations 
the stock market  and in particular the market for pharmaceutical and biotechnology company stocks  has also experienced significant decreases in value in the past 
this volatility and valuation decline have affected the market prices of securities issued by many companies  often for reasons unrelated to their operating performance  and might adversely affect the price of our common stock 
although we currently meet the listing requirements for the nasdaq capital market  our common stock could be de listed from the nasdaq capital market 
the national association of securities dealers nasdaq has certain standards for the continued listing of a security on the nasdaq capital market 
these standards require  among other things  that a listed issuer have a publicly held securities with a market value of at least million  b a bid price of at least per share  and c any one of the following i minimum stockholders equity of million  ii net income from continuing operations of  in the most recently completed fiscal year or in two of the three most recently completed fiscal years  or iii market value of the listed securities of at least million 
if we are unsuccessful in maintaining our nasdaq listing  then we may pursue listing and trading of our common stock on the over the counter bulletin board or another securities exchange or association with different listing standards than nasdaq 
a change in listings may result in a reduction in some or all of the following  each of which could have a material adverse effect on our shareholders the liquidity of our common stock  the market price of our common stock  our ability to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations  the number of institutional and general investors that will consider investing in our common stock  the number of investors in general that will consider investing in our common stock  the number of market makers in our common stock  the availability of information concerning the trading prices and volume of our common stock  and the number of broker dealers willing to execute trades in shares of our common stock

business overview we are an international contract research organization providing drug discovery and development services 
our clients and partners include pharmaceutical  biotechnology  academic and governmental organizations 
we apply innovative technologies and products and a commitment to quality to help clients and partners accelerate the development of safe and effective therapeutics and maximize the returns on their research and development investments 
we offer an efficient  variable cost alternative to our clients internal product development programs 
outsourcing development work to reduce overhead and speed drug approvals through the food and drug administration fda is an established alternative to in house development among pharmaceutical companies 
we derive our revenues from sales of our research services and drug development tools  both of which are focused on determining drug safety and efficacy 
the company has been involved in the research of drugs to treat numerous therapeutic areas for over years 
we support the preclinical and clinical development needs of researchers and clinicians for small molecule and large biomolecule drug candidates 
we believe our scientists have the skills in analytical instrumentation development  chemistry  computer software development  physiology  medicine  analytical chemistry and toxicology to make the services and products we provide increasingly valuable to our current and potential clients 
our principal clients are scientists engaged in analytical chemistry  drug safety evaluation  clinical trials  drug metabolism studies  pharmacokinetics and basic research at many of the small start up biotechnology companies and the largest global pharmaceutical companies 
our business is largely dependent on the level of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies efforts in new drug discovery and approval 
our services segment is a direct beneficiary of these efforts  through outsourcing by these companies of research work 
our products segment is an indirect beneficiary of these efforts  as increased drug development leads to capital expansion  providing opportunities to sell the equipment we produce and the consumable supplies we provide that support our products 
research services are capital intensive 
the investment in equipment and facilities to serve our markets is substantial and continuing 
while our physical facilities are adequate to meet market needs for the near term  rapid changes in automation  precision  speed and technologies necessitate a constant investment in equipment and software to meet market demands 
we are also impacted by the heightened regulatory environment and the need to improve our business infrastructure to support our operations  which will necessitate additional capital investment 
our ability to generate capital to reinvest in our capabilities  both through operations and financial transactions  is critical to our success 
while we are currently committed to fully utilizing recent additions to capacity  sustained growth will require additional investment in future periods 
our financial position could limit our ability to make such investments 
executive overview our revenues are dependent on a relatively small number of industries and clients 
as a result  we closely monitor the market for our services 
for a discussion of the trends affecting the market for our services  see item business trends affecting the drug discovery and development industry 
in fiscal  we experienced decreased demand for our products and services as compared to fiscal we believe in the fundamentals of the market and that it will continue to slowly rebound in future periods 
for fiscal  we plan to focus on sales execution  operational excellence and building strategic partnerships with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  to differentiate our company and create value for our clients and shareholders 
we review various metrics to evaluate our financial performance  including revenue  margins and earnings 
revenues declined approximately and gross margin declined from fiscal in fiscal  we consolidated our bioanlaytical laboratories into our headquarters in west lafayette  indiana  closing facilities in mcminnville  oregon and the uk to reduce operating costs and strengthen our ability to meet clients needs by improving laboratory utilization 
we also implemented personnel reductions and other cost cutting measures in selling  r d and general and administrative functions 
the cost of these restructuring activities totaled  in the current year 
as a result  we reported a net loss of  in fiscal as compared to net income of in fiscal the majority of the restructuring activities  though  occurred in the second half of the fiscal year 
due to these activities  gross margin improved in the second half of fiscal operating expenses declined in the same time period 
as a result  we had operating income of before restructuring charges in the second half of fiscal compared to an operating loss of  in the first half 
we will continue initiatives to control costs and improve productivity to achieve our financial objectives 
for a detailed discussion of our revenue  margins  earnings and other financial results for the fiscal year ended september   see results of operations compared to below 
as of september   we had of cash and cash equivalents as compared to  of cash and cash equivalents at the end of fiscal in fiscal  we used in cash from operations primarily from the net loss we reported versus net income in fiscal total capital expenditures declined in fiscal  particularly in the second half  as we limited spending to only necessary expenditures 
we negotiated an amendment on our loans with regions bank  extending the maturity date to october our line of credit with entrepreneur growth capital llc was automatically renewed for another year 
we listed for sale our headquarters facility in west lafayette  indiana with the intent to leaseback of that square footage in which to continue our laboratory and manufacturing operations 
further  we announced the launch of culex nxt  the latest generation of the company s proprietary in vivo automated sampling system  which we expect to begin shipping in our second quarter of fiscal we are poised for increased capacity utilization and potential strategic growth in fiscal we believe that the development of innovative new drugs is going through an evolution  evidenced by the significant reduction of expenditures on research and development at several major international pharmaceutical companies  accompanied by increases in outsourcing and investments in smaller start up companies that are performing the early development work on new compounds 
many of these companies are funded by either venture capital or pharmaceutical investment  or both  and generally do not build internal staffs that possess the extensive scientific and regulatory capabilities to perform the various activities necessary to progress a drug candidate to the filing of an investigative new drug ind application with the fda 
while continuing to maintain and develop our relationships with large pharmaceutical companies  we intend to aggressively promote our services to developing businesses  which will require us to expand our existing capabilities to provide services early in the drug development process  and to consult with clients on regulatory strategy and compliance leading to their fda filings 
we have launched our enhanced drug discovery services as part of this strategy  utilizing our proprietary culex technology to provide early experiments in our laboratories that previously would have been conducted in the sponsor s facilities 
as we move forward  we must balance the demands of the large pharmaceutical companies with the personal touch needed by smaller biotechnology companies to develop a competitive advantage 
we intend to accomplish this through the use of and expanding upon our existing project management skills  strategic partnerships and progressive relationship management 
we are focused on improving our cash flow from operations in fiscal to reduce our reliance on our line of credit 
if we are unable to increase cash flow from operations in fiscal  we may not have sufficient liquidity to continue our business 
patient protection and affordable care act in march  the patient protection and affordable care act the act was enacted by the us congress and signed into law by the president 
the purpose of the legislation is to extend medical insurance coverage to a higher percentage of us citizens 
many of the provisions in the act have delayed effective dates over the next decade  and will require extensive regulatory guidance 
companies in our principal client industry  pharmaceuticals  will be required under the act to provide additional discounts on medicines provided under medicare and medicaid to assist in the funding of the program  however  government estimates are that over million additional citizens will eventually be covered by medical insurance as a result of the act  which should expand the markets for their products 
it is premature to accurately predict the impacts these and other competing forces will have on our basic client market  drug development 
additionally  the act does not directly impact spiraling health care costs in the us  which could lead to additional legislation impacting our target markets in the future 
we maintain an optional health benefits package for all of our full time employees  which is largely paid by our contributions with employees paying a portion of the cost  generally less than of the total 
based on our current understanding of the act  we do not anticipate significant changes to our programs or of their costs to the company or our employees as a result of the act 
we have experienced increases in the costs of our health benefit programs in excess of inflation rates  and expect those trends to continue 
we are exploring options in plan funding  delivery of benefits and employee wellness in our continuing effort to obtain maximum benefit for our health care expenditures  while maintaining quality programs for our employees 
we do not expect these efforts to have a material financial impact on the company 
results of operations the following table summarizes the consolidated statement of operations as a percentage of total revenues year ended september  service revenue product revenue total revenue cost of service revenue a cost of product revenue a total cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses restructuring charges operating income loss other expense income loss before income taxes income tax expense net income loss a percentage of service and product revenues  respectively 
compared to service and product revenues revenues for the year ended september  decreased to  compared to  for the year ended september  our services revenue decreased to  compared to  for the prior fiscal year primarily as a result of lower bioanalytical analysis and toxicology revenues 
study delays by clients  lower new bookings in the current fiscal year and price declines contributed to the decline in bioanalytical analysis revenues as did the closure of our mcminnville  oregon laboratory as part of our restructuring activities described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the decline in toxicology revenues stems mainly from the residual effect of two significant customers merging their operations which led to a cancellation of a large contract expected to earn revenues in the current fiscal year 
this decline was slightly offset by higher pharmaceutical analysis and discovery services revenues  included in other laboratory services in the table below  as new bookings and volumes of studies have increased from the prior year 
our enhanced drug discovery services were launched in fiscal the following table shows more detail for our service revenue 
fiscal year ended september  change bioanalytical analysis    toxicology    other laboratory services   sales in our products segment decreased from  to  when compared to the prior fiscal year 
the majority of the decrease stems both from lower sales of our culex automated in vivo sampling systems over prior fiscal year with the release of the culex nxt system in fiscal believed to have caused a slowdown in fiscal orders and from lower analytical instruments sales due to customer spending slowdown 
the following table shows more detail for our product revenue 
fiscal year ended september  change culex  in vivo sampling systems   analytical instruments   other instruments cost of revenue cost of revenue for the year ended september  was  or of revenue compared to  or of revenue for the comparable prior period 
cost of service revenue as a percentage of service revenue increased to in the current fiscal year from in the prior year 
the principal cause of this increase was the revenue decline which led to lower absorption of the fixed costs in our service segment 
a significant portion of our costs of productive capacity in the service segment are fixed 
thus  decreases in revenues lead to increases in costs as a percentage of revenue 
cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue in the current fiscal year increased to from in the prior fiscal year 
this increase is mainly due to a change in the mix of products sold in fiscal operating expenses selling expenses for the year ended september  increased by to  from  for the year ended september  this increase was primarily driven by an increase in the number of sales personnel and higher spending for marketing  advertising and consulting services as we implemented our new sales and marketing strategy in the first half of the fiscal year 
in the second half of fiscal  we reduced selling expenses due to restructuring activities at our west lafayette  indiana and uk locations 
research and development expenses for the year ended september  increased to from for the year ended september  in the second half of fiscal  we reduced research and development expenses due to personnel reductions as part of restructuring activities 
general and administrative expenses for the current fiscal year decreased to  from  for the prior year 
more specifically  general and administrative expenses for the second half of fiscal were lower than the first half of fiscal due to restructuring activities at our west lafayette and evansville  indiana locations as well as our uk location 
this decrease occurred despite recording severance expenses for our former ceo and cfo  higher consulting and accounting fees and increased product liability insurance and software maintenance 
other income expense other income expense  net  was for the year ended september  as compared to for the year ended september  income taxes our effective tax rate for continuing operations for the year ended september   was compared to for the prior fiscal year 
the current year expense primarily relates to state franchise taxes 
the expense in fiscal relates to cash tax expense for us corporate alternative minimum tax 
no net benefits have been provided on taxable losses in the current fiscal year 
restructuring activities in march  we announced a plan to restructure our bioanalytical laboratory operations 
we consolidated our laboratory in mcminnville  oregon into our  square foot headquarters facility in west lafayette  indiana 
this plan was implemented to reduce operating costs and strengthen our ability to meet clients needs by improving laboratory utilization 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we decided to initiate closure of our facility and bioanalytical laboratory in warwickshire  united kingdom after careful evaluation of its financial performance and analysis of our strategic alternatives 
we will continue to sell our products globally while further consolidating delivery of our cro services into our indiana locations 
as part of the overall evaluation of our business  personnel reductions in the selling  r d and general and administrative functions were also implemented at both of our indiana locations during the second half of fiscal in total  employees were terminated as part of the restructuring activities this fiscal year 
the following table sets forth the costs incurred in connection with these restructuring activities during the year ended september  description amount one time termination benefits  lease related costs equipment moving costs and method transfers travel and relocation costs loss on sale of equipment other costs total  we have reserved for lease payments at the cease use date and have considered free rent  sublease rentals and the number of days it would take to restore the space to its original condition prior to our improvements 
based on this  we have reserved for lease related costs 
restructuring related costs incurred during fiscal totaled  in our services segment  in our products segment and  in corporate expenses 
the following table sets forth the rollforward of the restructuring activity for the year ended september  balance  september  total charges cash payments other balance  september  one time termination benefits   lease related costs equipment moving costs and method transfers travel and relocation costs loss on sale of equipment other costs total    other costs include legal and professional fees and other costs incurred in connection with transitioning services from sites being closed as well as costs incurred to remove improvements previously made to the uk facility 
other activity in the reserve rollforward primarily reflects a receivable for settlement of the capital lease in the uk 
liquidity and capital resources comparative cash flow analysis at september   we had cash and cash equivalents of compared to  at september  net cash used by operating activities was for the year ended september   compared to  provided for the year ended september  the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in the current fiscal year partially results from our current operating loss versus operating income in the prior year period as well as cash paid during the current year for restructuring activities of  other contributing factors to our cash from operations were an increase in accounts payable of  partially due to the restructuring liabilities of  and noncash charges of  of depreciation and amortization 
included in operating activities for fiscal are non cash charges of  for depreciation and amortization offset by a decrease in customer advances of  the impact on operating cash flow of other changes in working capital was not material 
we have seen significant reductions in expenses in the second half of fiscal as compared to the first half 
operating expenses declined approximately in the second half of fiscal primarily due to restructuring efforts and cost containment initiatives 
investing activities used in fiscal for capital expenditures 
our principal investments included a waste water treatment facility at one of our sites  renovation costs associated with a health care clinic at our corporate headquarters  new laboratory equipment  replacements and upgrades in all of our facilities  as well as general building and information technology infrastructure expenditures at all sites 
the proceeds from sale of equipment relate to the closure of our uk facility 
the decrease in capital spending from fiscal is a result of cost containment initiatives during the year 
financing activities used  in the current fiscal year as compared to  provided in fiscal the main use of cash in fiscal was for long term debt and capital lease payments of  these were slightly offset by net borrowings on our line of credit of and a direct common share purchase by company executives and directors  which provided the main source of cash in fiscal was the completion of our may equity offering  which netted  as well as net borrowings on our line of credit of  offset by long term debt and capital lease payments of  including the two individual principal payments on one mortgage and one note payable and the down payments of for the new capital leases for laboratory equipment 
capital resources property and equipment spending totaled  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in spending in fiscal is the result of cost containment initiatives during the year 
we have notes payable to regions bank regions aggregating approximately  regions notes payable currently include two outstanding mortgages on our facilities in west lafayette and evansville  indiana  which total  the mortgage loans initially matured in november with an interest rate fixed at and monthly principal payments of approximately plus interest 
on november   we executed amendments on two loans with regions 
regions agreed to accept a principal payment on the note payable maturing on december  and a principal payment on one mortgage maturing on february  the principal payments were made on december  and february   respectively 
upon receipt of these two payments  regions incorporated the two loans into a replacement note payable for  maturing on november  the replacement note payable bears interest at a per annum rate equal to the day libor plus basis points minimum of with monthly principal payments of approximately plus interest 
the replacement note payable is secured by real estate at our west lafayette and evansville  indiana locations 
at september   the replacement note payable had a balance of  as part of the amendment  regions also agreed to amend the loan covenants for the related debt to be more favorable to us 
regions requires us to maintain certain ratios including a fixed charge coverage ratio and total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio 
the fixed charge coverage ratio calculation currently requires a ratio of not less than to 
we are also required to maintain a ratio of our total liabilities to tangible net worth of not greater than to 
if we fail to comply with these covenants   the loan agreement restricts our ability to purchase fixed assets 
on november   we executed a sixth amendment with regions 
on december   we executed an amended and restated sixth amendment with regions 
regions agreed to extend the term loan and mortgage loan maturity dates to october  the unpaid principal on the notes was incorporated into a replacement note payable for  bearing interest at libor plus basis points minimum of with monthly principal payments of approximately plus interest 
the replacement note payable is secured by real estate at our west lafayette and evansville  indiana locations 
at september   we were not in compliance with the fixed charge coverage and the total liabilities to tangible net worth ratios in the regions agreements  mainly due to the net losses in the first nine months of fiscal and restructuring charges incurred in current fiscal year 
on november   regions waived compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio 
on december   regions waived compliance with the total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio 
based on projections for fiscal  we expect to be in compliance with the regions covenants for fiscal failure to comply with those covenants in future quarters would be a default under the regions loans  requiring us to negotiate with regions regarding loan modifications or waivers 
if we are unable to obtain such modifications or waivers  regions could accelerate the maturity of the loans and cause a cross default with our other lender 
borrowings under our credit agreements are collateralized by substantially all assets related to our operations and all common stock of our us subsidiaries and of the common stock of our non united states subsidiaries 
under the terms of our credit agreements  we have agreed to restrict advances to subsidiaries and limit additional indebtedness 
the regions loan agreements both contain cross default provisions with each other and with the revolving line of credit with entrepreneur growth capital llc egc described below 
the replacement note payable with regions matures in the first quarter of fiscal we intend to refinance the amounts in lieu of making balloon payments for the remaining principal balances or sell the building in west lafayette  indiana 
on july   we listed for sale our acres and  square foot facility at kent avenue  west lafayette  indiana with the intent to leaseback approximately of that square footage in which to continue our laboratory and manufacturing operations 
the asking price was  we performed an impairment analysis on the building when we listed it for sale  but noted no impairment 
as of september  the net book value of the facility and land was  we may be unsuccessful in renegotiating the terms of the debt or they may be unfavorable to us 
for these reasons  if we are unsuccessful at refinancing our long term debt  our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
revolving line of credit on january   we entered into a new  revolving line of credit agreement credit agreement with egc 
the term of the credit agreement expires on january  if we terminate prior to the expiration of the term  then we are subject to an early termination fee equal to the minimum interest charges of for each of the months remaining until expiration 
borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at an annual rate equal to citibank s prime rate plus five percent  or as of september   with minimum monthly interest of interest is paid monthly 
the line of credit also carries an annual facilities fee of and a collateral monitoring fee 
borrowings under the credit agreement are secured by a blanket lien on our personal property  including certain eligible accounts receivable  inventory  and intellectual property assets  a second mortgage on our west lafayette and evansville real estate and all common stock of our us subsidiaries and of the common stock of our non united states subsidiary 
borrowings are calculated based on of eligible accounts receivable 
under the credit agreement  the company has agreed to restrict advances to subsidiaries  limit additional indebtedness and capital expenditures and maintain a minimum tangible net worth of at least  pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement  the line of credit will automatically renew on january  unless either party gives a day notice of intent to terminate or withdraw 
on december   we negotiated an amendment to this credit agreement 
the amendment reduced the minimum tangible net worth covenant requirement from  to  effective on january   and waived all non compliances with this covenant through december  the credit agreement also contains cross default provisions with the regions loans and any future egc loans 
at september   we were not in compliance with the minimum tangible net worth covenant requirement 
on december  egc waived compliance with this covenant as part of the amendment 
at september   we had available borrowing capacity of  on this line  of which  was outstanding and of cash on hand 
we had a decrease in our total borrowing capacity of  from  to  from the fiscal year ended september  primarily as a result of lower accounts receivable from lower revenues offset slightly by our success in collecting receivables 
based on our current business activities and cash on hand  we expect to borrow on our revolving credit facility in fiscal to finance working capital 
based on projections for fiscal  we expect to be in breach of the tangible net worth covenant for our first quarter of fiscal  but in compliance the remaining three quarters 
egc waived our projected breach in the amendment to the credit agreement on december  failure to comply with the minimum tangible net worth covenant or any other event of default under the credit agreement would allow egc to stop rendering advances and to accelerate the maturity of the outstanding balance 
to conserve cash  we instituted a freeze on non essential capital expenditures and are monitoring all spending closely 
for fiscal  we expect to see slow but continued improvement in the volume of new bookings with little improvement in pricing 
we also expect improved gross profit margins due to cost controls implemented and restructuring activities 
based on our expected revenue  the availability on our line of credit  the impact of the cost reductions implemented and restructuring activities during fiscal  we project that we will have the liquidity required to meet our fiscal operations and debt obligations 
should operations materially fail to meet our expectations for the coming fiscal year  we may not be able to comply with all of our debt covenants  requiring that we obtain a waiver at that time 
if that situation arises  we will be required to negotiate with our lending bank again to obtain loan modifications or waivers as described above 
we cannot predict whether our lenders will provide those waivers  if required  what the terms of any such waivers might be or what impact any such waivers will have on our liquidity  financial condition or results of operations 
we are focused on improving our cash flow from operations in fiscal to reduce our reliance on our line of credit 
if we are unable to increase cash flow from operations in fiscal  we may not have sufficient liquidity to continue our business 
the following table summarizes the cash payments under our contractual term debt and other obligations at september  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future fiscal periods amounts in thousands 
the table does not include our revolving line of credit 
additional information on the debt is described in note  debt arrangements 
total notes payable   capital lease obligations operating leases we anticipate spending approximately million in fiscal on capital assets 
equity offering amounts in this section not in thousands on may   we completed a registered public offering of  units at a price of  per unit 
each unit consists of one series a convertible preferred share which is convertible into common shares at a conversion price of per share  one class a warrant to purchase common shares at an exercise price of per share  and one class b warrant to purchase common shares at an exercise price of per share 
the designation  rights  preferences and other terms and provisions of the preferred shares are set forth in the certificate of designation 
until may   the series a preferred shares have a stated dividend rate of per annum  payable quarterly in cash or  subject to certain conditions  in common shares or a combination of cash and common shares  at our election 
after may   the series a preferred shares will participate in any dividends payable upon our common shares on an as converted basis 
if the preferred shares are converted prior to may   we must also pay to the converting holder in cash  or subject to certain conditions  in common shares or a combination thereof  per  of the stated value of the preferred shares less any dividends paid prior to conversion a make whole payment 
class a warrants are exercisable immediately and expire in may class b warrants expired in may the net proceeds from the sale of the units  after deducting the fees and expenses of the placement agent and other expenses were million 
we used the proceeds for the purchase of laboratory equipment and for working capital and general corporate purposes 
because the preferred dividend or make whole payment is triggered at the option of the preferred shareholder  we recorded the dividend liability at the time of the offering close and will not have any preferred dividends subsequent to the fiscal quarter ended june  as of september    preferred shares have been converted into  common shares and  common shares have been issued for quarterly preferred dividends for remaining outstanding  unconverted preferred shares 
no warrants have been exercised as of september  at september    preferred shares and  warrants remained outstanding 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material adverse effect on our business  operations or financial condition 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and liquidity and capital resources discusses the consolidated financial statements of the company  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
preparation of these financial statements requires management to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
certain significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of the financial statements require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments  and are considered critical accounting policies 
we have identified the following areas as critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition the majority of our service contracts involve the processing of bioanalytical samples for pharmaceutical companies 
these contracts generally provide for a fixed fee for each assay method developed or sample processed and revenue is recognized under the specific performance method of accounting 
under the specific performance method  revenue and related direct costs are recognized when services are performed 
other service contracts generally consist of preclinical studies for pharmaceutical companies 
service revenue is recognized based on the ratio of direct costs incurred to total estimated direct costs under the proportional performance method of accounting 
losses on contracts are provided in the period in which the loss becomes determinable 
revisions in profit estimates are reflected on a cumulative basis in the period in which such revisions become known 
the establishment of contract prices and total contract costs involves estimates made by the company at the inception of the contract period 
these estimates could change during the term of the contract which could impact the revenue and costs reported in the consolidated financial statements 
projected losses on contracts are provided for in their entirety when known 
revisions to estimates have not been material 
service contract fees received upon acceptance are deferred and classified within customer advances  until earned 
unbilled revenues represent revenues earned under contracts in advance of billings 
product revenue from sales of equipment not requiring installation  testing or training is recognized upon shipment to customers 
one product includes internally developed software and requires installation  testing and training  which occur concurrently 
revenue from these sales is recognized upon completion of the installation  testing and training when the services are bundled with the equipment sale 
long lived assets  including goodwill long lived assets  such as property and equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized of the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
we carry goodwill at cost 
other intangible assets with definite lives are stated at cost and are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
all intangible assets acquired that are obtained through contractual or legal right  or are capable of being separately sold  transferred  licensed  rented  or exchanged  are recognized as an asset apart from goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized 
goodwill is tested annually for impairment  and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
first  we can assess qualitative factors in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment aspect of this guidance due to the restructuring circumstances 
then  we followed a two step quantitative process 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit  as computed primarily by present value cash flow calculations  to its book carrying value  including goodwill 
we do not believe that market value is indicative of the true fair value of the company mainly due to average daily trading volumes of less than 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired and we would then complete step in order to measure the impairment loss 
in step  the implied fair value is compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill  we would recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference 
the implied fair value is calculated by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in step to all of its assets and liabilities including unrecognized intangible assets and any excess in fair value that is not assigned to the assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
the discount rate  gross margin and sales growth rates are the two material assumptions utilized in our calculations of the present value cash flows used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units when performing the annual goodwill impairment test 
our reporting units with goodwill at september  are vetronics  which is included in our products segment  bioanalytical services and preclinical services located in evansville  indiana  which are both included in our services segment  based on the discrete financial information available which is reviewed by management 
we utilize a cash flow approach in estimating the fair value of the reporting units  where the discount rate reflects a weighted average cost of capital rate 
the cash flow model used to derive fair value is sensitive to the discount rate and sales growth assumptions used 
due to the closure of the mcminnville  oregon site  we tested for impairment of the bioanalytical business at the end of our third fiscal quarter using the cash flow approach as explained above 
this test resulted in no impairment to the goodwill valuation as currently recorded on the books 
we also performed our annual impairment test for all reporting units mentioned above at september  using a discount rate of and a revenue growth rate of for the bioanalytical services and for both the preclinical services and vetronics units  the fair values of the reporting units described above are greater than the carrying values by approximately million 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows 
assumptions used in our impairment evaluations  such as forecasted sales growth rates and our cost of capital or discount rate  are based on the best available market information 
changes in these estimates or a continued decline in general economic conditions could change our conclusion regarding an impairment of goodwill and potentially result in a non cash impairment loss in a future period 
the assumptions used in our impairment testing could be adversely affected by certain of the risks discussed in risk factors in item a of this report 
there have been no significant events since the timing of our impairment tests that would have triggered additional impairment testing 
at september   remaining recorded goodwill was  and the net balance of other intangible assets was stock based compensation we recognize the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions in our financial statements using a fair value based method 
we measure compensation cost for all share based awards based on estimated fair values and recognize compensation over the vesting period for awards 
we recognized stock based compensation related to stock options of and during the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively 
we use the binomial option valuation model to determine the grant date fair value 
the determination of fair value is affected by our common stock price as well as assumptions regarding subjective and complex variables such as expected employee exercise behavior and our expected stock price volatility over the term of the award 
generally  our assumptions are based on historical information and judgment is required to determine if historical trends may be indicators of future outcomes 
we estimated the following key assumptions for the binomial valuation calculation risk free interest rate 
the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury yields in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the option 
expected volatility 
we use our historical stock price volatility on our common stock for our expected volatility assumption 
expected term 
the expected term represents the weighted average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding 
the expected term is determined based on historical exercise behavior  post vesting termination patterns  options outstanding and future expected exercise behavior 
expected dividends 
we assumed that we will pay no dividends 
employee stock based compensation expense recognized in fiscal and was calculated based on awards ultimately expected to vest and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates and an adjustment will be recognized at that time 
changes to our underlying stock price  our assumptions used in the binomial option valuation calculation and our forfeiture rate as well as future grants of equity could significantly impact compensation expense recognized in future periods 
income tax accounting as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we recognize the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we record valuation allowances based on a determination of the expected realization of tax assets 
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position 
we measure the amount of the accrual for which an exposure exists as the largest amount of benefit determined on a cumulative probability basis that we believe is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement of the position 
we record interest and penalties accrued in relation to uncertain income tax positions as a component of income tax expense 
any changes in the accrued liability for uncertain tax positions would impact our effective tax rate 
over the next twelve months we do not anticipate resolution to the carrying value of our reserve 
interest and penalties are included in the reserve 
as of september  and  we had a and liability for uncertain income tax positions  respectively 
we file income tax returns in the us  several us states  and the foreign jurisdiction of the united kingdom 
we remain subject to examination by taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which we have filed returns for years after we have an accumulated net deficit in our uk subsidiary 
consequently  united states deferred tax assets on such earnings have not been recorded 
also  a valuation allowance was established in fiscal against the us deferred income tax balance 
we had previously recorded a valuation allowance on the uk subsidiary deferred income tax balance 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo cost method of accounting 
we evaluate inventories on a regular basis to identify inventory on hand that may be obsolete or in excess of current and future projected market demand 
for inventory deemed to be obsolete  we provide a reserve for this inventory 
inventory that is in excess of current and projected use is reduced by an allowance to a level that approximates the estimate of future demand 
new accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued updated fair value measurement and disclosure guidance that clarifies how to measure fair value and requires additional disclosures regarding level fair value measurements  as well as any transfers between level and level fair value measurements 
the updated accounting guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning on or after december  on a prospective basis 
the company adopted this guidance in the second fiscal quarter with no material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb amended the manner in which an entity presents the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single  continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the amendment eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity 
the amendment is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning on or after december  on a retrospective basis 
the adoption of this guidance will not change the previously reported amounts of comprehensive income 
the company has presented other comprehensive income on the face of the condensed consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented 
in september  the fasb issued an accounting standards update that amends the two step goodwill impairment test by permitting an entity to first assess qualitative factors in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if the entity determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step goodwill impairment test is unnecessary 
the amendment is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning on or after december  on a prospective basis  early adoption is permitted 
the company elected to bypass the qualitative assessment aspect of this guidance due to the restructuring circumstances and performed a quantitative analysis in the third and fourth fiscal quarters of the quantitative analysis resulted in no impairment to the goodwill valuation as currently recorded on the books 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk not applicable
