critical accounting policies principles of consolidation the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its wholly owned subsidiary bml from the date of its acquisition on october  all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
foreign currency translation the company s functional and reporting currency is us dollars 
the consolidated financial statements of the company are translated to us dollars in accordance with asc  foreign currency matters 
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date 
gains and losses arising on translation or settlement of foreign currency denominated transactions or balances are included in the determination of income 
the company has not  to the date of these consolidated financial statements  entered into derivative instruments to offset the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
long lived assets long lived assets  including mining property  are evaluated for impairment whenever events or conditions indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the related asset or group of assets  a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the asset or group of assets 
income taxes deferred income taxes are reported for timing differences between items of income or expense reported in the consolidated financial statements and those reported for income tax purposes in accordance with asc  income taxes  which requires the use of the asset liability method of accounting for income taxes 
deferred income taxes and tax benefits are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and for tax loss and credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is not more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
comprehensive income loss asc  comprehensive income  establishes standards for the reporting and disclosure of comprehensive income loss and its components in the financial statements 
as at december   the company has items that represent a comprehensive loss and  therefore  has included a schedule of comprehensive loss in the consolidated financial statements 
basic and diluted net income loss per share the company computes net income loss per share in accordance with asc  earnings per share 
asc requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share eps on the face of the income statement 
basic eps is computed by dividing net income loss available to common shareholders numerator by the weighted average number of shares outstanding denominator during the period 
diluted eps gives effect to all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if converted method 
in computing diluted eps  the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants 
diluted eps excludes all potentially dilutive shares if their effect is anti dilutive 
financial instruments the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents  accounts payable  debenture payable  note payable and due to related parties approximate fair values due to the short term maturity of these financial instruments 
credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject the company to credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents 
the company deposits cash and cash equivalents with high credit quality financial institutions as determined by rating agencies 
as a result  credit risk is considered insignificant 
currency risk the company s major expenses and payables are in united states currency and are expected to continue to incur in united states currency 
fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states dollar and other currency may have a material effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company does not actively hedge against foreign currency fluctuations

it is management s opinion that the company is not exposed to significant interest risk arising from these financial instruments
