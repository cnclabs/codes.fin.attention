as a result of electric industry restructuring  the company has a significant amount of stranded electric generation and power supply related supply costs 
if the company is unable to recover a significant amount of stranded costs in its rates  or if the company s recovery of stranded costs in its rates is significantly delayed  then the company s financial condition or results or operations could be adversely affected 
the stranded electric generation and power supply related supply costs resulting from the implementation of electric industry restructuring mandated by the states of new hampshire and massachusetts are recovered by the company on a pass through basis through periodically reconciled rates 
any unrecovered balance of stranded costs is deferred for future recovery as a regulatory asset 
such regulatory assets are subject to periodic regulatory review and approval for recovery in future periods 
substantially all of the company s stranded costs relate to i unitil power s long term power purchase agreements which unitil power divested under long term contract buyout agreements and ii fitchburg s formerly owned generation assets and purchase power agreements which fitchburg divested under a long term contract buy out agreement 
unitil power made the final payment on its long term contract buyout agreements in october  which ended its obligations in the underlying purchase power contracts 
as a result  in accordance with its retail stranded cost recovery rates  as of december   unitil energy has recovered substantially all of its stranded costs with the remaining million of stranded costs projected to be fully recovered over the next ten years 
because fitchburg continues to remain ultimately responsible for purchase power payments underlying its long term buyout agreements  fitchburg could incur additional stranded costs if they were required to resell such divested entitlements prior to the end of their term for amounts less than the amounts agreed to under the existing long term buyout agreements 
the company expects that any such additional stranded costs would be recovered from its customers  however such recovery would require approval from the mdpu  the receipt of which cannot be assured 
if the company is unable to recover a significant amount of such stranded costs in its rates  or if the company s recovery of such stranded costs in its rates is significantly delayed  then the company s financial condition or results or operations could be adversely affected

table of contents the company s electric and natural gas sales and revenues are highly correlated with the economy  and national  regional and local economic conditions may adversely affect the company s customers and correspondingly the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company s business is influenced by the economic activity within its service territory 
the level of economic activity in the company s electric and natural gas distribution service territory directly affects the company s business 
as a result  adverse changes in the economy may adversely affect the company s financial condition or results or operations 
the company may not be able to obtain financing  or may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms  which could adversely affect the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company requires capital to fund utility plant additions  working capital and other utility expenditures 
while the company derives the capital necessary to meet these requirements primarily from internally generated funds  the company supplements internally generated funds by incurring short term debt under its current credit facility  as needed 
if the lending counterparties under the company s current credit facility are unwilling or unable to meet their funding obligations  then the company may be unable to  or limited in its ability to  incur short term debt under its credit facility 
this could hinder or prevent the company from meeting its current and future capital needs  which could correspondingly adversely affect the company s financial condition or results or operations 
also  from time to time  the company repays portions of its short term debt with the proceeds it receives from long term debt financings or equity financings 
general economic conditions and the company s operating and financial performance could negatively affect the company s ability to obtain such financings and the terms of such financings  which could correspondingly adversely affect the company s financial condition or results or operations 
declines in the valuation of capital markets could require the company to make substantial cash contributions to cover its pension obligations 
if the company is unable to recover a significant amount of pension obligation costs in its rates  or if the company s recovery of pension obligation costs in its rates is significantly delayed  then the company s financial condition or results or operations could be adversely affected 
please see i the section entitled critical accounting policies pension benefit obligations in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and ii note retirement benefit plans to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
increases in interest rates could increase the company s interest expense and adversely affect the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company and its utility subsidiaries have ongoing capital expenditure and cash funding requirements  which they frequently fund by issuing short term debt and long term debt 
the company s short term debt revolving credit facility typically has variable interest rates 
therefore  an increase or decrease in interest rates will increase or decrease the company s interest expense associated with its revolving credit facility 
an increase in the company s interest expense could adversely affect the company s financial condition or results of operations 
as of december   the company had approximately million in short term debt outstanding under its revolving credit facility 
the company s long term debt typically has fixed interest rates 
therefore  changes in interest rates will not affect the company s interest expense associated with its presently outstanding fixed rate long term debt 
however  an increase or decrease in interest rates may increase or decrease the company s interest expense associated with any new fixed rate long term debt issued by the company  which could adversely affect the company s financial condition or results of operations 
see part ii  item below for management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity  commitments and capital requirements section and note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in addition  the company may need to use a significant portion of its cash flow to repay its short term debt and long term debt  which would limit the amount of cash it has available for working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes and could adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations 
the terms of the company s and its subsidiaries indebtedness restrict the company s business operations including their ability to incur material amounts of additional indebtedness  which could adversely affect the company s financial condition or results or operations 
see part ii  item below for management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity  commitments and capital requirements section and note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
a significant amount of the company s sales are temperature sensitive 
because of this  mild winter and summer temperatures could decrease the company s sales  which could adversely affect the company s financial condition or results or operations 
also  the company s sales may vary from year to year depending on weather conditions  and the company s results of operations generally reflect seasonality 
the company estimates that approximately of its annual natural gas sales are temperature sensitive 
therefore  mild winter temperatures could decrease the amount of natural gas sold by the company  which could adversely affect the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company s electric sales also are temperature sensitive  but less so than its natural gas sales 
the highest usage of electricity typically occurs in the summer months due to air conditioning demand and the winter months due to heating related and lighting requirements 
therefore  mild summer temperatures and mild winter temperatures could decrease the amount of electricity sold by the company  which could adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
also  because of this temperature sensitivity  sales by the company s distribution utilities vary from year to year  depending on weather conditions 
on august   the mdpu issued an order approving revenue decoupling mechanisms rdm for the electric and natural gas divisions of the company s massachusetts combination electric and natural gas distribution utility  fitchburg 
revenue decoupling is the term given to the elimination of the dependency of a utility s distribution revenue on the volume of electricity or natural gas sales 
the purpose of decoupling is to eliminate the disincentive a utility otherwise has to encourage energy efficiency programs 
under the rdm  the company will recognize  in its consolidated statements of earnings from august  forward  distribution revenues for fitchburg based on predetermined amounts approved by the mdpu 
the difference between distribution revenue amounts billed to customers and the predetermined amounts is recognized as increases or decreases in accrued revenue which form the basis for future reconciliation adjustments in periodically resetting rates for future cash recoveries or credits 
in addition  the company s results of operations generally reflect seasonality 
in particular  the company expects that results of operations will be positively affected during the first and fourth quarters  when sales of natural gas are typically higher due to heating related requirements  and negatively affected during the second and third quarters  when gas operating and maintenance expenses usually exceed sales margins in the period 
long term global climate change could adversely affect customer demand or cause extreme weather events that could disrupt the company s electric and natural gas distribution services 
milder winter and summer temperatures due to long term global climate change may cause a decrease in the amount of natural gas and electricity sold by the company  which could correspondingly adversely affect the company s financial condition and results or operations 
conversely  colder winter temperatures and warmer summer temperatures due to long term global climate change may cause an increase in the amount of natural gas and electricity sold by the company 
in addition  extreme weather events such as hurricanes and severe winter storms related to long term global climate change may damage facilities or result in increased service interruptions and outages and 
table of contents increase the company s operations and maintenance costs 
if the company is unable to recover a significant amount of such costs in its rates  or if the company s recovery of such costs in its rates is significantly delayed  then the company s financial condition or results or operations could be adversely affected 
the company is unable to predict the impacts on its financial condition and results or operations due to changes in weather related to long term global climate change 
unitil is a public utility holding company and has no operating income of its own 
the company s ability to pay dividends on its common stock is dependent on dividends and other payments received from its subsidiaries and on factors directly affecting unitil  the parent corporation 
the company cannot assure that its current annual dividend will be paid in the future 
the ability of the company s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to unitil depends on  among other things the actual and projected earnings and cash flow  capital requirements and general financial condition of the company s subsidiaries  the prior rights of holders of existing and future preferred stock  mortgage bonds  long term notes and other debt issued by the company s subsidiaries  the restrictions on the payment of dividends contained in the existing loan agreements of the company s subsidiaries and that may be contained in future debt agreements of the company s subsidiaries  if any  and limitations that may be imposed by new hampshire  massachusetts and maine state regulatory agencies 
in addition  before the company can pay dividends on its common stock  it has to satisfy its debt obligations and comply with any statutory or contractual limitations 
the company s current annual dividend is per share of common stock  payable quarterly 
however  the company s board of directors reviews unitil s dividend policy periodically in light of the factors referred to above  and the company cannot assure the amount of dividends  if any  that may be paid in the future 
the company s electric and natural gas distribution activities including storing natural gas and supplemental gas supplies involve numerous hazards and operating risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs 
any such accident or costs could adversely affect the company s financial position and results of operations 
inherent in the company s electric and natural gas distribution activities are a variety of hazards and operating risks  including leaks  explosions  electrocutions and mechanical problems 
these hazards and risks could result in loss of human life  significant damage to property  environmental pollution  damage to natural resources and impairment of the company s operations  which could adversely affect the company s financial position and results of operations 
the company maintains insurance against some  but not all  of these risks and losses in accordance with customary industry practice 
the location of pipelines  storage facilities and electric distribution equipment near populated areas including residential areas  commercial business centers and industrial sites could increase the level of damages associated with these risks 
the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect the company s financial position or results of operations 
the company s business is subject to environmental regulation in all jurisdictions in which it operates and its costs of compliance are significant 
new or changes to existing environmental regulation  including those related to climate change or greenhouse gas emissions  and the incurrence of environmental liabilities could adversely affect the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company s utility operations are generally subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to air quality  water quality  waste management  natural 
table of contents resources  and the health and safety of the company s employees 
the company s utility operations also may be subject to new and emerging federal  state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives related to climate change or greenhouse gas emissions including the us environmental protection agency s mandatory greenhouse gas reporting rule 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil  and criminal penalties and other sanctions  imposition of remedial requirements  and issuance of injunctions to ensure future compliance 
liability under certain environmental laws and regulations is strict  joint and several in nature 
although the company believes it is in material compliance with all applicable environmental and safety laws and regulations  there can be no assurance that the company will not incur significant costs and liabilities in the future 
moreover  it is possible that other developments  such as increasingly stringent federal  state or local environmental laws and regulations  including those related to climate change or greenhouse gas emissions  could result in increased environmental compliance costs 
catastrophic events could adversely affect the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the electric and natural gas utility industries are from time to time affected by catastrophic events  such as unusually severe weather and significant and widespread failures of plant and equipment 
other catastrophic occurrences  such as terrorist attacks on utility facilities  may occur in the future 
such events could inhibit the company s ability to provide electric or natural gas distribution services to its customers for an extended period  which could adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company s business could be adversely affected if it is unable to retain its existing customers or attract new customers 
the success of the company s business depends  in part  on its ability to maintain and increase its customer base 
the company s failure to maintain or increase its customer base could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations 
the company s energy brokering customers may default in their performance under multi year energy brokering contracts  which could adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company s non regulated energy brokering business provides energy brokering and consulting services to a national client base of large commercial and industrial customers 
revenues from this business are primarily derived from brokering fees and charges billed to suppliers as customers take delivery of energy from these suppliers under term contracts 
the company s customers may default in their performance under multi year energy brokering contracts  which could adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a note references are to notes to the consolidated financial statements in item overview unitil is a public utility holding company headquartered in hampton  new hampshire 
unitil is subject to regulation as a holding company system by the ferc under the energy policy act of on december   the company purchased i all of the outstanding capital stock of northern utilities  a natural gas distribution utility serving customers in new hampshire and maine  from bay state and ii all of the outstanding capital stock of granite state  an interstate natural gas transmission pipeline company from nisource 
unitil s principal business is the local distribution of electricity and natural gas throughout its service territory in the states of new hampshire  massachusetts and maine 
unitil is the parent company of three wholly owned distribution utilities i unitil energy  which provides electric service in the southeastern seacoast and state capital regions of new hampshire  ii fitchburg  which provides both electric and natural gas service in the greater fitchburg area of north central massachusetts  and iii northern utilities  which provides natural gas service in southeastern new hampshire and portions of southern and central maine  including the city of portland and the lewiston auburn area 
unitil energy  fitchburg and northern utilities are collectively referred to as the distribution utilities 
together  the distribution utilities serve approximately  electric customers and  natural gas customers in their service territory 
in addition  unitil is the parent company of granite state  a natural gas transmission pipeline  regulated by the ferc  operating miles of underground gas transmission pipeline primarily located in maine and new hampshire 
granite state provides northern utilities with interconnection to major natural gas pipelines and access to north american pipeline supplies 
the distribution utilities are local pipes and wires operating companies and unitil had an investment in net utility plant of million at december  unitil s total revenue was million in  which includes revenue to recover the approved cost of purchased electricity and natural gas in rates on a fully reconciling basis 
as a result of this reconciling rate structure  the company s earnings are not affected by changes in the cost of purchased electricity and natural gas 
earnings from unitil s utility operations are derived from the return on investment in the three distribution utilities and granite state 
unitil also conducts non regulated operations principally through usource  which is wholly owned by unitil resources 
usource provides energy brokering and consulting services to a national client base of large commercial and industrial customers 
usource s total revenues were million in the company s other subsidiaries include unitil service  which provides  at cost  a variety of administrative and professional services to unitil s affiliated companies  and unitil realty  which owns and manages unitil s corporate office building and property located in hampton  new hampshire 
unitil s consolidated net income includes the earnings of the holding company and these subsidiaries 
regulation unitil is subject to comprehensive regulation by federal and state regulatory authorities 
unitil and its subsidiaries are subject to regulation as a holding company system by the ferc under the energy policy act of with regard to certain bookkeeping  accounting and reporting requirements 
unitil s utility operations related to wholesale and interstate energy business activities are also regulated by the ferc 
unitil s distribution utilities are subject to regulation by the applicable state public utility commissions  with regard to their rates  issuance of securities and other accounting and operational matters unitil energy is subject to regulation by the new hampshire public utilities commission nhpuc  fitchburg is subject to regulation by the massachusetts department of public utilities mdpu  and northern utilities is regulated 
table of contents by the nhpuc and maine public utilities commission mpuc 
granite state  unitil s interstate natural gas transmission pipeline  is subject to regulation by the ferc with regard to its rates and operations 
because unitil s primary operations are subject to rate regulation  the regulatory treatment of various matters could significantly affect the company s operations and financial position 
unitil s distribution utilities deliver electricity and or natural gas to all customers in their service territory  at rates established under traditional cost of service regulation 
under this regulatory structure  unitil s distribution utilities recover the cost of providing distribution service to their customers based on a historical test year  in addition to earning a return on their capital investment in utility assets 
as a result of a restructuring of the utility industry in new hampshire  massachusetts and maine  unitil s customers have the opportunity to purchase their electricity or natural gas supplies from third party energy supply vendors 
most customers  however  continue to purchase such supplies through the distribution utilities under regulated energy rates and tariffs 
unitil s distribution utilities purchase electricity or natural gas from unaffiliated wholesale suppliers and recover the actual approved costs of these supplies on a pass through basis  as well as certain costs associated with industry restructuring  through reconciling rate mechanisms that are periodically adjusted 
in  the company completed base rate cases for unitil energy  the electric and gas divisions of fitchburg  the maine division of northern utilities  and granite state 
the completion of these rate cases resulted in increases in annual distribution revenues of million for unitil energy  million and million for the electric and gas divisions of fitchburg  respectively  million for the maine division of northern utilities 
granite state received approval for an increase of million in annual revenue 
the new hampshire division of northern utilities requested an increase of million in annual distribution revenues in its base rate case filing 
the company is currently in settlement discussions with the nhpuc regarding its base rate case filing for northern utilities new hampshire division and a final rate order is expected in the first quarter see rate case activity in part i  item for additional information on these rate cases 
on august   the mdpu issued an order approving revenue decoupling mechanisms rdm for the electric and natural gas divisions of the company s massachusetts combination electric and natural gas distribution utility  fitchburg 
revenue decoupling is the term given to the elimination of the dependency of a utility s distribution revenue on the volume of electricity or natural gas sales 
one of the primary purposes of decoupling is to eliminate the disincentive a utility otherwise has to encourage and promote energy conservation programs designed to reduce energy usage 
under the rdm  the company will recognize  in its consolidated statements of earnings from august  forward  distribution revenues for fitchburg based on established revenue targets 
the established revenue targets for the gas division may be subject to periodic adjustments to account for customer growth and special contracts  for which rdm does not apply 
the difference between distribution revenue amounts billed to customers and the targeted amounts is recognized as increases or decreases in accrued revenue which form the basis for future reconciliation adjustments in periodically resetting rates for future cash recoveries from  or credits to  customers 
the company estimates that rdm applies to approximately and of unitil s total annual electric and natural gas sales volumes  respectively 
as a result  the sales margins resulting from those sales are no longer sensitive to weather and economic factors 
the company s other electric and natural gas distribution utilities are not subject to rdm

critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
in making those estimates and assumptions  the company is sometimes required to make difficult  subjective and or complex judgments about the impact of matters that are inherently uncertain and for which different estimates that could reasonably have been used could have resulted in material differences in its financial statements 
if actual results were to differ significantly from those estimates  assumptions and judgment  the financial position of the company could be materially affected and the results of operations of the company could be materially different than reported 
the following is a summary of the company s most critical accounting policies  which are defined as those policies where judgments or uncertainties could materially affect the application of those policies 
for a complete discussion of the company s significant accounting policies  refer to the financial statements and note summary of significant accounting policies 
regulatory accounting the company s principal business is the distribution of electricity and natural gas by the three distribution utilities unitil energy  fitchburg and northern utilities 
unitil energy and fitchburg are subject to regulation by the ferc 
fitchburg is also regulated by the mdpu  unitil energy is regulated by the nhpuc and northern utilities is regulated by the mpuc and nhpuc 
granite state  the company s natural gas transmission pipeline  is regulated by the ferc 
accordingly  the company uses the regulated operations guidance as set forth in the financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification fasb codification 
in accordance with the fasb codification  the company has recorded regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities which will be recovered from customers  or applied for customer benefit  in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable public utility regulatory commission 
the fasb codification specifies the economic effects that result from the cause and effect relationship of costs and revenues in the rate regulated environment and how these effects are to be accounted for by a regulated enterprise 
revenues intended to cover some costs may be recorded either before or after the costs are incurred 
if regulation provides assurance that incurred costs will be recovered in the future  these costs would be recorded as deferred charges or regulatory assets 
if revenues are recorded for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future  these revenues would be recorded as deferred credits or regulatory liabilities 
the company s principal regulatory assets and liabilities are included on the company s consolidated balance sheet and a summary of the company s regulatory assets is provided in note thereto 
the company receives a return on investment on its regulated assets for which a cash outflow has been made 
regulatory commissions can reach different conclusions about the recovery of costs  which can have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company believes it is probable that its regulated distribution and transmission utilities will recover their investments in long lived assets  including regulatory assets 
if the company  or a portion of its assets or operations  were to cease meeting the criteria for application of these accounting rules  accounting standards for businesses in general would become applicable and immediate recognition of any previously deferred costs  or a portion of deferred costs  would be required in the year in which the criteria are no longer met  if such deferred costs were not recoverable in the portion of the business that continues to meet the criteria for application of the fasb codification topic on regulated operations 
if unable to continue to apply the fasb codification provisions for regulated operations  the company would be required to apply the provisions for the discontinuation of rate regulated accounting included in the fasb codification 
in the company s opinion  its regulated operations will be subject to the fasb codification provisions for regulated operations for the foreseeable future 

table of contents utility revenue recognition utility revenues are recognized according to regulations and are based on rates and charges approved by federal and state regulatory commissions 
revenues related to the sale of electric and gas service are recorded when service is rendered or energy is delivered to customers 
however  the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters  which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month 
at the end of each calendar month  amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated 
this unbilled revenue is estimated each month based on estimated customer usage by class and applicable customer rates 
on august   the mdpu issued an order approving revenue decoupling mechanisms rdm for the electric and natural gas divisions of the company s massachusetts combination electric and natural gas distribution utility  fitchburg 
revenue decoupling is the term given to the elimination of the dependency of a utility s distribution revenue on the volume of electricity or natural gas sales 
one of the primary purposes of decoupling is to eliminate the disincentive a utility otherwise has to encourage and promote energy conservation programs designed to reduce energy usage 
under the rdm  the company will recognize  in its consolidated statements of earnings from august  forward  distribution revenues for fitchburg based on established revenue targets 
the established revenue targets for the gas division may be subject to periodic adjustments to account for customer growth and special contracts  for which rdm does not apply 
the difference between distribution revenue amounts billed to customers and the targeted amounts is recognized as increases or decreases in accrued revenue which form the basis for future reconciliation adjustments in periodically resetting rates for future cash recoveries from  or credits to  customers 
the company s other electric and natural gas distribution utilities are not subject to rdm 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company recognizes a provision for doubtful accounts each month based upon the company s experience in collecting electric and gas utility service accounts receivable in prior years 
at the end of each month  an analysis of the delinquent receivables is performed which takes into account an assumption about the cash recovery of delinquent receivables 
the analysis also calculates the amount of written off receivables that are recoverable through regulatory rate reconciling mechanisms 
the company s distribution utilities are authorized by regulators to recover the costs of their energy commodity portion of bad debts through rate mechanisms 
evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts requires judgment about the assumptions used in the analysis  including expected fuel assistance payments from governmental authorities and the level of customers enrolling in payment plans with the company 
it has been the company s experience that the assumptions it has used in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts have proven to be reasonably accurate 
retirement benefit obligations the company sponsors the unitil corporation retirement plan pension plan  which is a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all of its employees 
the company also sponsors an unfunded retirement plan  the unitil corporation supplemental executive retirement plan serp  covering certain executives of the company  and an employee k savings plan 
additionally  the company sponsors the unitil employee health and welfare benefits plan pbop plan  primarily to provide health care and life insurance benefits to retired employees 
the fasb codification requires companies to record on their balance sheets as an asset or liability the overfunded or underfunded status of their retirement benefit obligations rbo based on the projected benefit obligation 
the company has recognized a corresponding regulatory asset  to recognize the future collection of these obligations in electric and gas rates 
the company s rbo and reported costs of providing retirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
the company has made critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions  including assumptions of expected returns on plan assets  future compensation  health care cost trends  and appropriate discount rates 
the company s rbo are affected by actual employee demographics  the level of contributions made to the plans  earnings on plan assets  and health care cost trends 
changes made to the provisions of these plans may also affect current and future costs 
if these assumptions were changed  the resultant change in benefit obligations  fair values of plan assets  funded status and net periodic benefit costs could have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
the discount rate assumptions used in determining retirement plan costs and retirement plan obligations are based on an assessment of current market conditions using high quality 
table of contents corporate bond interest rate indices and pension yield curves 
for the years ended december  and  a change in the discount rate of would have resulted in an increase or decrease of approximately  and  respectively  in the net periodic benefit cost for the pension plan 
for the years ended december  and  a increase in the assumption of health care cost trend rates would have resulted in increases in the net periodic benefit cost for the pbop plan of  and  respectively 
similarly  a decrease in the assumption of health care cost trend rates for those same time periods would have resulted in decreases in the net periodic benefit cost for the pbop plan of  and  respectively 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
income taxes the company is subject to federal and state income taxes as well as various other business taxes 
this process involves estimating the company s current tax liabilities as well as assessing temporary and permanent differences resulting from the timing of the deductions of expenses and recognition of taxable income for tax and book accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the company accounts for income tax assets  liabilities and expenses in accordance with the fasb codification guidance on income taxes 
the company classifies penalty and interest expense related to income tax liabilities as income tax expense and interest expense  respectively  in the consolidated statements of earnings 
provisions for income taxes are calculated in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates for each period for which a statement of earnings is presented 
the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the fasb codification guidance on income taxes which requires an asset and liability approach for the financial accounting and reporting of income taxes 
significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the current and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the company s current and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect its best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid 
periodically  the company assesses the realization of its deferred tax assets and liabilities and adjusts the income tax provision  the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts and circumstances which gave rise to the revision become known 
depreciation depreciation expense is calculated on a group straight line basis based on the useful lives of assets and judgment is involved when estimating the useful lives of certain assets 
the company conducts independent depreciation studies on a periodic basis as part of the regulatory ratemaking process and considers the results presented in these studies in determining the useful lives of the company s fixed assets 
a change in the estimated useful lives of these assets could have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
commitments and contingencies the company s accounting policy is to record and or disclose commitments and contingencies in accordance with the fasb codification as it applies to an existing condition  situation  or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
as of december   the company is not aware of any material commitments or contingencies other than those disclosed in the significant contractual obligations table in the contractual obligations section above and the commitments and contingencies footnote to the company s consolidated financial statements below 
refer to recently issued accounting pronouncements in note of the notes of consolidated financial statements for information regarding recently issued accounting standards

risk factors 

table of contents interest rate risk as discussed above  unitil meets its external financing needs by issuing short term and long term debt 
the majority of debt outstanding represents long term notes bearing fixed rates of interest 
changes in market interest rates do not affect interest expense resulting from these outstanding long term debt securities 
however  the company periodically repays its short term debt borrowings through the issuance of new long term debt securities 
changes in market interest rates may affect the interest rate and corresponding interest expense on any new issuances of long term debt securities 
in addition  short term debt borrowings bear a variable rate of interest 
as a result  changes in short term interest rates will increase or decrease interest expense in future periods 
for example  if the average amount of short term debt outstanding was million for the period of one year  a change in interest rates of would result in a change in annual interest expense of approximately  the average interest rate on short term borrowings was   and during   and  respectively 
market risk although unitil s three distribution utilities are subject to commodity price risk as part of their traditional operations  the current regulatory framework within which these companies operate allows for full collection of electric power and natural gas supply costs in rates on a pass through basis 
consequently  there is limited commodity price risk after consideration of the related rate making 
additionally  as discussed above and below in regulatory matters  the company has divested its commodity related contracts and therefore  further reduced its exposure to commodity risk
