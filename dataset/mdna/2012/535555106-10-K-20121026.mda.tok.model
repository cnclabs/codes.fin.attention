table of contents overview the company manufactures and markets zimmatic  greenfield and perrot center pivot  lateral move  and hose reel irrigation systems 
the company also produces and markets irrigation controls  chemical injection systems and remote monitoring and control systems which it sells under its growsmart brand 
these products are used by farmers to increase or stabilize crop production while conserving water  energy  and labor 
through its acquisitions  the company has been able to enhance its capabilities in providing innovative  turn key solutions to customers through the integration of its proprietary pump stations  controls and designs 
the company sells its irrigation products primarily to a world wide independent dealer network  who resell to their customer  the farmer 
the company s primary production facilities are located in the united states 
the company has smaller production and sales operations in france  brazil  italy and china as well as distribution and sales operations in south africa  australia and new zealand 
the company also manufactures and markets various infrastructure products  including moveable barriers for traffic lane management  crash cushions  preformed reflective pavement tapes and other road safety devices  through its production facilities in omaha  nebraska  rio vista  california and milan  italy 
in addition  the company s infrastructure segment produces large diameter steel tubing and railroad signals and structures  and provides outsourced manufacturing and production services for other companies 
for the business overall  the global  long term drivers of water conservation  population growth  increasing importance of biofuels  and the need for safer  more efficient transportation solutions remain positive 
key factors which impact demand for the company s irrigation products include agricultural commodity prices  net cash farm income  crop yields  weather  environmental regulations  availability of financing and interest rates 
a key factor which impacts demand for the company s infrastructure products is the amount of spending authorized by governments to improve road and highway systems 
much of the us highway infrastructure market is driven by government spending programs 
for example  the us government funds highway and road improvements through the federal highway trust fund program 
this program provides funding to improve the nation s roadway system 
matching funding from the various states may be required as a condition of federal funding 
the company continues to have an ongoing  structured  acquisition process that is expected to generate additional growth opportunities throughout the world in water and infrastructure 
lindsay is committed to achieving earnings growth by global market expansion  improvements in margins  and strategic acquisitions 
since  the company has added the operations in europe  south america  south africa  australia  new zealand and china 
the addition of those operations has allowed the company to strengthen its market position in those regions  yet they remain relatively small in scale 
as a result  none of the international operations has achieved the operating margin of the united states based irrigation operations

the asu requires additional disclosure for level measurements regarding the sensitivity of fair value to changes in unobservable inputs and any interrelationships between those inputs 
the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not expect the adoption of this standard to impact its consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 presentation of comprehensive income  which amends asc  comprehensive income  by requiring all nonowner changes in shareholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements

table of contents in september  the fasb issued asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other 
asu no 
allows entities to first assess qualitatively whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
if an entity believes  as a result of its qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting period is less than its carrying amount  the quantitative two step goodwill impairment test is required 
an entity has the unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to performing the first step of the goodwill impairment test 
the guidance is effective for annual and interim impairment tests for fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not expect the adoption of this standard to impact its consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 amendments to disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities 
the objective of asu no 
is to provide enhanced disclosures that will enable users of its financial statements to evaluate the effect or potential effect of netting arrangements on an entity s financial position 
this includes the effect or potential effect of rights of setoff associated with an entity s recognized assets and recognized liabilities which include derivatives  sale and repurchase agreements  reverse sale and repurchase agreements  securities borrowing  and securities lending arrangements

the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after january  the company does not expect the adoption of this standard to impact its consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued asu no 
 amendments to testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
asu no 
allows entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
if  after assessing the totality of events and circumstances  an entity concludes that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired  then the entity is not required to take further action 
however  if an entity concludes otherwise  then it is required to determine the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying amount 
an entity also has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test 
an entity will be able to resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 
the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after september  the company does not expect the adoption of this standard to impact its consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  management must make a variety of decisions which impact the reported amounts and the related disclosures 
such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates 
in reaching such decisions  management applies judgment based on its understanding and analysis of the relevant facts and circumstances 
certain of the company s accounting policies are critical  as these policies are most important to the presentation of the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
they require the greatest use of judgments and estimates by management based on the company s historical experience and management s knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances 
management periodically re evaluates and adjusts the estimates that are used as circumstances change 
following are the accounting policies management considers critical to the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the last in  first out lifo method for the company s lindsay  nebraska inventory and two warehouses in idaho and texas 
cost is determined by the first in  first out fifo method for inventory at the company s omaha  nebraska warehouse  and at operating locations in california  wisconsin  china and australia 
cost is determined by the weighted average cost method for inventory at the company s other operating locations in washington state  france  brazil  italy and south africa 
at all locations  the company reserves for obsolete  slow moving  and excess inventory by estimating the net realizable value based on the potential future use of such inventory 

table of contents valuation of goodwill  identifiable intangible assets and other long lived assets assessment of the potential impairment of goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets is an integral part of the company s normal ongoing review of operations 
testing for potential impairment of these assets is significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects management s best estimates at a particular point in time 
the dynamic economic environments in which the company s businesses operate and key economic and business assumptions related to projected selling prices  market growth  inflation rates and operating expense ratios  can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests 
estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results 
changes in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments  as well as the time in which such impairments are recognized 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination 
acquired intangible assets are recognized separately from goodwill 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment at least annually at august and whenever triggering events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable 
the company performs the impairment analysis at the reporting unit level using a two step impairment test 
fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis  which requires the company to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the particular assets being tested for impairment as well as to select a discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows 
when determining future cash flow estimates  the company considers historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions 
estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and assumptions by management in such areas as future economic conditions  industry specific conditions  product pricing  and necessary capital expenditures 
to the extent that the reporting unit is unable to achieve these assumptions  impairment losses may emerge 
the company updated its impairment evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at august  the estimated fair value of each of the company s reporting units exceeded the respective carrying values by more than percent 
accordingly  no impairment losses were indicated as a result of the annual impairment testing for fiscal years   and if assumptions on discount rates and future cash flows change as a result of events or circumstances  and the company believes that the long term profitability may have declined in value  then the company may record impairment charges  resulting in lower profits 
sales and profitability of each of the company s reporting units may fluctuate from year to year and within a year 
in the evaluation of the fair value of reporting units  the company looks at the long term prospects for the reporting unit and recognizes that current performance may not be the best indicator of future prospects or value  which requires management judgment 
indefinite life intangible assets primarily consist of tradenames trademarks 
the fair value of these assets are determined using a relief from royalty analysis that determines the fair value of each trademark through use of a discounted cash flow model that incorporates an estimated royalty rate the company would be able to charge a third party for the use of the particular trademark 
when determining the future cash flow estimates  the company must estimate future net sales and a fair market royalty rate for each applicable tradename at an appropriate discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows 
estimating future net sales requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions  industry specific conditions  product pricing  and consumer trends 
revenue recognition the company s basic criteria necessary for revenue recognition are evidence of a sales arrangement exists  delivery of goods has occurred  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
the company recognizes revenue when these criteria have been met and when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer 
the company generally has no post delivery obligations to its independent dealers other than standard warranties 
revenues and gross profits on intercompany sales are eliminated in consolidation 

table of contents revenues from the sale of the company s irrigation products to its us independent dealers  international locations  and sales by its international locations are recognized based on the delivery terms in the sales contract 
if an arrangement involves multiple deliverables  the delivered items are considered separate units of accounting if the items have value on a stand alone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of their fair values 
revenues from the arrangement are allocated to the separate units of accounting based on their objectively determined fair value 
revenues for retail sales of irrigation products are recognized when the product or service is delivered to the end user customers 
a small portion of the company s revenues relate to subscription revenue of wireless management services and are recognized on a straight line basis over the contract term 
revenues from the sale of infrastructure products are usually recognized when the product is delivered to the customer  however  they are dependent on the specific delivery terms in the sales contract 
the company leases certain infrastructure property held for lease to customers such as moveable concrete barriers and qmb systems 
revenues for the lease of infrastructure property held for lease are recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term 
if an infrastructure project is completed ahead of schedule and prior to the lease term end date  the company accelerates the lease term and the timing of recognized revenue once the company is no longer required to perform under the lease contract 
the costs related to revenues are recognized in the same period in which the specific revenues are recorded 
shipping and handling fees billed to customers are reported in revenue 
shipping and handling costs incurred by the company are included in cost of sales 
customer rebates  cash discounts and other sales incentives are recorded as a reduction of revenues at the time of the original sale 
estimates used in the recognition of operating revenues and cost of operating revenues include  but are not limited to  estimates for product warranties  product rebates  cash discounts and fair value of separate units of accounting on multiple deliverables 
environmental remediation liabilities the company is subject to an array of environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment 
in particular  the company committed to remediate environmental contamination of the groundwater at and adjacent to its lindsay  nebraska facility the site with the us environmental protection agency the epa 
the company and its environmental consultants have developed a remedial action work plan  under which the company continues to work with the epa to define and implement steps to better contain and remediate the remaining contamination 
environmental remediation liabilities include costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up  such as materials  external contractor costs and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy 
the company accrues the anticipated cost of environmental remediation when the obligation is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
estimates used to record environmental remediation liabilities are based on the company s best estimate of probable future costs based on site specific facts and circumstances 
estimates of the cost for the likely remedy are developed using our internal resources or by third party environmental engineers or other service providers 
the company records the undiscounted environmental remediation liabilities that represent the points in the range of estimates that are most probable or the minimum amount when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount 
although the company has accrued all reasonably estimable costs associated with remediation of the site  it is expected that additional testing and environmental monitoring and remediation will be required in the future as part of the company s ongoing discussions with the epa regarding the development and implementation of the remedial action plans  which could result in changes to its estimates 
in addition  the current investigation has not yet been completed and does not include all affected areas on the site 
estimates continue to be refined and evaluated on a number of remediation alternatives and the epa has not provided approval of possible action plans 
while additional estimated expenses could significantly exceed the amount accrued as of august  and could be material to the operating results of any fiscal quarter or fiscal year  the company does not expect that such additional expenses would have a material adverse effect on its liquidity or financial condition 
during fiscal  and  the company accrued incremental costs of million  million and million for additional environmental monitoring and remediation in connection with the ongoing remedial action work plan

market conditions and fiscal outlook farm incomes and commodity prices remain strong by historical standards and have continued to drive positive farmer sentiment 
as of august   the usda projects us net farm income to be the highest on record at billion and percent higher than the ten year average of billion  continuing to represent positive economic conditions for us farmers 
adverse weather conditions in several parts of the world  and most notably the drought in the us  has altered the outlook for the overall agriculture sector and particularly irrigation equipment 
current price levels of commodities suggest that may potentially be a positive year for irrigation equipment demand 
the us federal government examines the level of farm subsidies and tax credits from time to time and changes to these programs could have a positive or adverse impact on commodity prices and irrigation equipment demand 
demand for lindsay s irrigation equipment is closely aligned with net farm income and commodity prices and can fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis 
the company believes the most significant opportunities for growth over the next several years are in international markets  where irrigation use is significantly less developed  and demand is driven by food security  water scarcity and population growth 
infrastructure demand  including for qmb system projects  has proven to be challenging due to funding issues and project delays 
the infrastructure segment continues to experience revenue and profit volatility due to the project nature of the qmb systems and the fixed nature of some operating expenses 
however  the company has made progress in reducing the infrastructure segment cost structure in and expects sales growth and profit improvement in the infrastructure business in the qmb system project delays have not significantly changed the company s perspective on the likelihood of future demand for qmb systems 
the outlook for government funded infrastructure spending remains challenging due to global governmental budget constraints 
during the us government extended the multi year us highway bill through  creating moderately positive sentiment for us infrastructure spending by setting us transportation policy for the next two years 
however  the bill continues the trend of decreasing investment in road transportation and still limits long term infrastructure projects since it was only extended for two years 
the company is confident in the opportunity for qmb systems to drive significant profitability over the long term as a superior solution to worldwide traffic congestion  lost productivity and energy waste 
demand for the company s transportation safety products continues to be driven by population growth and the need for improved road safety 

table of contents as of august   the company has an order backlog of million compared with million at august  and million at may  the company s backlog can fluctuate from period to period due to the seasonality  cyclicality  timing and execution of contracts 
typically  the company s backlog at any point in time represents only a portion of the revenue it expects to realize during the following three month period 
however  the timing related to certain project oriented contracts may extend longer than three months 
for the company s business overall  the global  long term drivers of water conservation  population growth  increasing importance of biofuels  and the need for safer  more efficient transportation solutions remain positive 
in addition to the overall business enhancements that have taken place  the company continues to have an ongoing  structured  acquisition process that is expected to generate additional growth opportunities throughout the world in water and infrastructure 
lindsay is committed to achieving earnings growth by employing sound business strategies  including without limitation global market expansion  improvements in margins  and or strategic acquisitions

a majority of the company s revenue generated from operations outside the united states is denominated in local currency 
accordingly  these sales are not typically subject to significant foreign currency transaction risk 
the company s most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are the euro  the brazilian real  the south african rand and the chinese renminbi in relation to the us dollar 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies create exposures  which can adversely affect the company s results of operations 
based on the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended august   the company estimates the potential decrease in operating income from a percent adverse change in the underlying exchange rates  in us dollar terms  would be less than million 
in order to reduce exposures related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  the company  at times  may enter into forward exchange or option contracts for transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency for certain of its operations

the company had million of us dollar equivalent cash flow forward exchange contracts and option contracts outstanding as of august  in order to reduce translation exposure resulting from translating the financial statements of its international subsidiaries into us dollars  the company  at times  utilizes euro foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of its euro net investment exposure in its foreign operations 
at august   the company had outstanding euro foreign currency forward contracts to sell million euro at fixed prices expected to settle during the first quarter of fiscal based on the net investments contracts outstanding at august   the company estimates the potential decrease in fair value from a percent adverse change in the underlying exchange rates would be approximately million 
this decrease in fair value would be reflected as a reduction to other comprehensive income offsetting the translation exposure or adjustment of the international subsidiaries 
in order to reduce interest rate risk on the million bsi term note  the company has entered into an interest rate swap agreement with wells fargo bank  na that is designed to convert the variable interest rate on the entire amount of this borrowing to a fixed rate of percent per annum
