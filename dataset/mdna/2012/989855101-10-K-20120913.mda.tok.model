item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures at the date of our consolidated financial statements 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  inventories  marketable securities  share based compensation  warranty obligations  self insured healthcare claims  income taxes  discontinued operations  contract revenue  economic hedges and long lived assets 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and current market conditions and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts  discontinued operations  inventory valuation  valuation of marketable securities  share based compensation  warranty costs  self insured health insurance costs  accounting for income taxes  contract revenue and valuation of long lived assets to be critical policies due to the estimates and judgments involved in each 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts we recognize revenue based on guidance provided in sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition and in accordance with authoritative guidance issued by the financial accounting standard board fasb pertaining to revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  our price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue on our standard products when title passes to the customer upon shipment 
while our standard products generally require installation  the installation is considered a perfunctory performance obligation 
standard products do not have customer acceptance criteria 
generally  software is a component of our standard product and  as such  is not separately recognized as revenue 
we have standard rights of return for defective products that we account for as a warranty provision under authoritative guidance of accounting for contingencies 
we do not have any price protection agreements or other post shipment obligations 
for custom equipment where customer acceptance is part of the sales agreement  revenue is recognized when the customer has accepted the product 
in cases where custom equipment does not have customer acceptance as part of the sales agreement  we recognize revenue upon shipment as long as the system meets the specifications as agreed upon with the customer 
certain transactions have multiple deliverables  with the deliverables clearly defined 
to the extent that the secondary deliverables are other than perfunctory  we recognize the revenue on each deliverable  if separable  or on the completion of all deliverables  if not separable  all in a manner consistent with sab no 
and related authoritative guidance 
standalone software products are recognized as revenue when they are shipped 
certain customer transactions include payment terms whereby we receive a partial payment of the total order amount prior to the related revenue being recognized in our financial statements 
these advance payments are included in progress payments  deferred revenue and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings in the consolidated balance sheet 
these progress payments relate to orders for custom equipment that require a lengthy build cycle and  in some cases  acceptance by the customer 
we may negotiate payment terms with these customers on these particular orders and secure certain payments prior to or on shipment of the equipment 
these payments remain in progress payments or deferred revenue until our applicable revenue recognition criteria have been met 
certain contracts we enter into continue over an extended period of time 
we review those contracts for possible revenue recognition as a long term contract 
if long term contract accounting is appropriate  we then evaluate whether revenues should be recognized using the percentage of completion method 
under the percentage of completion method  we develop estimates as a basis for contract revenue and costs in progress as work on the contract continues 
estimates are reviewed and revised as additional information becomes available 
during fiscal  changes in estimates under the percentage of completeness method were not material 
revenue recognized in excess of billings is included in revenue recognized in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts in the consolidated balance sheet 
billings in excess of costs and earnings would be included in billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts in the consolidated balance sheet 
the percentage of completion method is used in circumstances in which all the following conditions exist the contract includes enforceable rights regarding goods or services to be provided to the customer  the consideration to be exchanged  and the manner and terms of settlement both the company and the customer are expected to satisfy all contractual obligations and reasonably reliable estimates of total revenue  total cost and the progress toward completion can be made 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a continuous review of customer accounts  payment patterns and specific collection issues 
we perform on going credit evaluations of our customers and do not require collateral from our customers 
for many of our international customers  we require an irrevocable letter of credit from the customer before a shipment is made 
if the financial condition of one or more of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
discontinued operations the company classifies operations as discontinued when the operations have either ceased  or are expected to be disposed of in a sale transaction in the near term and the operations and cash flows of all discontinued operations have been eliminated or will be eliminated upon consummation of the expected sale transaction and the company will not have any significant continuing involvement in the discontinued operations 
authoritative guidance related to the impairment or disposal of long lived assets requires the calculation of estimated fair value less cost to sell long lived assets for assets held for sale 
the calculation of estimated fair value less cost to sell includes significant estimates and assumptions  including  but not limited to operating projections  discount rate  excess working capital levels  property values  and the anticipated costs involved in the selling process 
as more fully described in note  discontinued operations  of our audited financial statements included in this annual report on form k  we have discontinued the singapore ic packaging operations of our vision systems product line  which was included in our metrology solutions segment  in september inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on a first in  first out basis 
management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory on a quarterly basis 
our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories  including raw materials  work in process and finished goods 
obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management s estimated future usage  over a reasonable period of time  is written down to its estimated market value  if less than its cost 
contracts with fixed prices are evaluated to determine if estimated total costs will exceed revenues 
a loss provision is recorded when the judgment is made that actual costs incurred plus estimated costs remaining to be incurred based on management s estimates will exceed total revenues from the contract 
inherent in the estimates of market value are management s estimates related to current economic trends  future demand for our products and technological obsolescence 
management estimates future product sales and service requirements and evaluates technological changes and other possible uses to determine if inventory is excess or obsolete 
if actual market conditions are different than those projected by management  additional inventory adjustments affecting earnings may be required 
other than temporary impairment of marketable securities marketable securities have been primarily classified as held to maturity  which requires them to be carried at amortized cost 
we also have certain securities that are classified as trading 
realized gains and losses are included in earnings and are derived using the specific identification method for determining the cost of securities sold 
management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of marketable securities on a quarterly basis 
marketable securities with unrealized depreciation in fair value for twelve or more consecutive months and other securities with unrealized losses are reviewed to determine whether the decline in fair value is other than temporary 
investment ratings  company specific events  general economic conditions and other reasons are evaluated in determining if the decline in fair value is other than temporary 
if it is judged that a decline in fair value is other than temporary  the marketable security is valued at the current fair value and an impairment charge is reflected in earnings 
share based compensation we calculate share based compensation expense in accordance with authoritative guidance pertaining to share based payments using the black scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of share based awards 
the key assumptions for this valuation method include the expected term of an option grant  stock price volatility  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
the determination of these assumptions is based on history and future expectations and is subject to a high level of judgment 
to the extent any of the assumptions were to change from year to year  the fair value of new option grants may vary significantly 
warranty costs we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
we consider historical warranty costs actually incurred together with specifically identified circumstances to establish the warranty liability 
the warranty liability is reviewed on a quarterly basis 
should actual costs differ from management s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
a fifteen percent change in warranty liability would have an immaterial impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
accounting for income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax basis and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we must assess the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
management considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in fiscal  management determined that it was more likely than not that we would not be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  and an adjustment to record a full valuation allowance was charged to income tax expense 
in fiscal  the company reversed a substantial amount of the valuation allowance based on the cumulative earnings for the last three years and future projected income 
our effective tax rate may vary from period to period based on changes in pre tax income between jurisdictions that have higher or lower tax rates  changes to federal  state  or foreign tax laws and deductibility of certain costs and expenses by jurisdiction 
economic hedges we hedge certain intercompany transactions by entering into forward contracts to reduce the impact of adverse fluctuations on earnings associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes 
we do not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative purposes nor do we designate such hedges for hedge accounting purposes 
these contracts are entered into for periods consistent with the currency transaction exposures  generally three to nine months 
any gains and losses on the fair value of these contracts are expected to be largely offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions 
valuation of long lived assets in accordance with authoritative guidance issued by the fasb pertaining to accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the carrying value of intangible assets and other long lived assets is reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of facts or circumstances  both internally and externally  that may suggest impairment 
some factors we consider important  which could trigger the impairment review  include a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  a significant adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset  an accumulation of costs for an asset in excess of the amount originally expected  a current period operating loss or cash flow decline combined with a history of operating loss or cash flow uses or a projection that demonstrates continuing losses and a current expectation that it is more likely than not that a long lived asset will be disposed of at a loss before the end of its estimated useful life 
if one or more of such facts or circumstances exist  we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to determine if an impairment exists based upon estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets and compare that value to the carrying value of the assets 
if the carrying value of the assets is greater than the estimated future cash flows  the assets are written down to the estimated fair value 
we determine the estimated fair value of the assets based on a current market value of the assets 
if a current market value is not readily available  a projected discounted cash flow method is applied using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the current business model 
our cash flow estimates contain management s best estimates  using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time 
health insurance we are self insured for the majority of our group health insurance 
we rely on claims experience in determining an adequate liability for claims incurred  but not reported 
to the extent actual claims exceed estimates  we may be required to record additional expense 
we also carry catastrophic insurance to manage our health insurance liability which provides for specific dollar caps on our liability for both single claims and total annual claims 
a six percent change in actual claims would have an immaterial impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
recent accounting guidance not yet adopted in june  the fasb issued new guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income that will require presentation of components of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement or in two separate  but consecutive statements 
there are no changes to the components that are recognized in net earnings or other comprehensive income under current us gaap

it is applicable to our fiscal periods beginning and subsequent to july  this guidance will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
adoption of new accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued guidance to amend certain measurement and disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements to improve consistency with international reporting standards 
this guidance is effective prospectively for public entities for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   with early adoption by public entities prohibited  and is applicable to our fiscal periods beginning and subsequent to january  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

these disclosure requirements became effective in two phases 
on january   we adopted the requirements for disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value as well as disclosures about significant transfers 
on july   we adopted the requirements for disclosures concerning the presentation of disaggregated activity within the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level 
the adoption of these amended standards did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb also issued guidance to clarify the reporting of pro forma financial information related to business combinations of public entities and to expand certain supplemental pro forma disclosures 
this guidance is effective prospectively for business combinations that occur on or after the beginning of a fiscal year beginning on or after december   with early adoption permitted 
it was applicable to our fiscal year beginning july  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

our net earnings in fiscal of per diluted share include a tax benefit of per diluted share relating to the reversal of substantially all of our valuation allowances pertaining to our deferred tax assets and costs charged to income related to an acquisition effort of per diluted share 
the reversal of the valuation allowance will result in a higher income tax rate in future periods then we have had in the two past years excluding the reversal of the valuation allowance 
our net earnings in fiscal of per diluted share included a gain on acquisition of per diluted share 
we conduct business in germany and china through joint ventures in which we are the majority owners

for fiscal  bookings were million  an increase of over fiscal bookings in fiscal included two major contract awards totaling over million  both related to the further development of the semiconductor roadmap working with some of the largest semiconductor manufacturers in the world 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we completed a transaction with asml to purchase substantially all the assets of asml s richmond  california operation  including a  square foot manufacturing facility 
the assets were acquired for million in cash and future consideration with a net present value of million  based on the projected level of shipments to asml over the next three years beginning january  in addition  we hired key management and employees working at the former asml richmond facility and formed our epo group  which is included in our optical systems segment 
with this acquisition  we have considerably expanded our optical manufacturing capabilities 
in fiscal  the fair value of the richmond assets acquired was greater than the purchase price  resulting in a gain on acquisition of million which was recorded in other income 
in addition  a deferred tax liability of million was recorded in the opening balance sheet  which had the effect of reducing the gain on acquisition to million 
the fair value of the assets was determined based on management s review of the value of the assets at the time of the acquisition

the increase in the metrology solutions segment revenues was primarily due to volume increases in instruments of million partially offset by volume decreases in lithography revenues of million 
we generated revenue increases across all of our regions with the exception of the japan region 
the china region contributed million to the increase  primarily due to a number of large custom systems delivered  and the americas region contributed million to the increased instruments net revenue on a year over year basis 
the decrease in lithography stage metrology revenues  which affected the japan region  is attributable to the decline in semiconductor capital market expenditures which we expect to continue for at least the next few quarters 
the increase in the optical systems segment revenues was primarily due to an increase of million of revenue from our epo group 
this increase in revenue was primarily due to a full year of operation for epo  which included million in a large multi year project received this year 
this increase was partially offset by a million decrease in contract manufacturing associated with the completion in fiscal of a large order and volume decreases in laser and optical components of million

the increase in the metrology solutions segment revenues was primarily due to volume increases in instruments of million and lithography stage metrology of million 
the increase in instruments was due to volume increases in large aperture and microscope products 
we generated revenue increases across all our regions 
large aperture revenues were especially strong in the americas and china included in our pacific rim geographic region 
the increase in lithography stage metrology was due to strength in the semiconductor market 
the increase in the optical systems segment revenues was primarily due to revenues of million generated by epo since the formation of the group in the second quarter of fiscal we also generated increases in contract manufacturing of million and precision optics of million 
the increase in contract manufacturing revenue was due to higher helmet mounted display unit volumes which more than offset declines in laser vision systems and dental wands 
approximately of all fiscal net revenues were denominated in us dollars  compared with in fiscal significant changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the value of the us dollar can influence the revenues of our products in export markets  as would changes in the general economic conditions in those markets

actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates  changes in the investment grade of marketable securities and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity we currently maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents consisting of an institutional money market fund and marketable securities consisting primarily of a mutual fund 
the institutional money market fund  with a balance of million  consists primarily of us treasury securities 
the mutual fund of million  which is related to our deferred compensation program  consists of corporate securities 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly on our short term instruments 
there is little downward exposure on our interest income 
to the extent interest rates increase or we change our investment strategy  there could be an increase in investment income 
exchange rate sensitivity approximately of our fiscal net revenues were denominated in us dollars 
at june   our backlog included bookings in us dollars of million  or  of the total backlog 
substantially all of our costs are negotiated and paid in us dollars 
significant changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the value of the us dollar can impact sales of our products in export markets as would changes in the general economic conditions in those markets 
for our net revenues that are based in local currency  we are exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations from the time customers are invoiced in local currency until collection occurs 
we enter into forward contracts to reduce the impact of adverse fluctuations on earnings associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes 
we do not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative purposes 
these forward contracts are entered into for periods consistent with the currency transaction exposures  generally three to six months 
any gains and losses on the fair value of these contracts would largely offset corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions 
the majority of our foreign currency transactions and foreign operations are denominated in the japanese yen and euro 
in the absence of a substantial increase in sales orders in currencies other than us dollars  we believe a appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar against the euro  yen and yuan would have an immaterial impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations
