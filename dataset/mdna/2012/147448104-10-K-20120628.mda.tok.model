the million decrease in net working capital at april  related largely to a million decrease in accounts receivable  a million decrease in the current portion of deferred income taxes  a million increase in accounts payable and a million increase in the current portion of accrued capping  closure and post closure costs  offset partially by a million increase in refundable income taxes and a million decrease in income taxes payable 
fiscal year financing activities on april   we entered into the first amendment to our revolver 
as a part of the amendment  we modified the financial covenants that the revolver is subject to  we amended the agreement to use proceeds of a term loan b or other subordinated financings which we may obtain to refinance our outstanding second lien notes  and we provided for adjustments to the financial covenants in the event that we undertake future financing activities 
on february   we converted the interest rate period on  and remarketed  million aggregate principal amount of the original million bonds 
the mandatorily tendered bonds the converted bonds were converted from a variable rate to a five year fixed term interest rate of per annum and included additional covenants and credit support for the benefit of the holders of those converted bonds  including guarantees by certain of our subsidiaries 
the converted bonds are no longer secured by a letter of credit issued by a bank 
the remaining million of outstanding bonds will remain as variable rate bonds secured by a letter of credit issued by a bank 
the bonds mature on january  we recorded a charge of million as a loss on debt extinguishment in the fourth quarter of fiscal year related primarily to the non cash write off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the original issuance of the bonds

the most significant items affecting the change in our operating cash flows for the fiscal years ended april  and are summarized below loss from continuing operations 
our loss from continuing operations increased million to million for the fiscal year ended april  from million for the fiscal year ended april  during the fiscal year ended april   we recorded a million non cash impairment charge related to our maine energy asset group  a million non cash impairment charge related to our investment in greenfiber and a million loss from equity method investment  million of which related to greenfiber s goodwill impairment charge 
these charges combined with a million loss on debt extinguishment  a million non cash gain on sale of assets  a million bargain purchase gain  a million asset impairment charge and a million income tax benefit in the fiscal year ended april  largely make up the unfavorable change in loss from continuing operations period over period 

table of contents cash interest payments 
cash interest payments decreased million for the fiscal year ended april  due to the effect of the timing and lower average interest rates associated with our capital structure 
changes in assets and liabilities  net of effects from business acquisitions and divestitures 
our cash flow from operations was favorably impacted million in the fiscal year ended april  by changes in our assets and liabilities 
this change is driven by favorable impacts related to our accounts receivable  which is affected by both revenue changes and timing of payments received  accounts payable  which are affected by both cost changes and timing of payments  and prepaid expenses  inventories and other assets  which is affected primarily by the timing of payments  expense recognition  as well as cost changes 
this favorable change was offset by the unfavorable impact related to accrued expenses and other liabilities  which are affected primarily by cost changes such as interest  the timing of payments  and changes related to accrued capping  closure  and post closure costs 
this is compared to the fiscal year ended april   when our cash flow from operations was unfavorably impacted million by changes in our assets and liabilities

the most significant items affecting the change in our investing cash flows for the fiscal year ended april  are summarized below capital expenditures 
higher capital expenditures of million in the fiscal year ended april  related primarily to recycling facility upgrades  a landfill gas to energy project and fleet replacement 
payments on landfill operating lease contracts 
higher payments of million for landfill operating lease contracts in the fiscal year ended april  due to the timing of payments 

table of contents investments in unconsolidated entities 
cash payments of million in the fiscal year ended april  related to our contributions totaling million for interests in tompkins and agreen  an additional million in contributions to greenfiber and our initial million contribution for an interest in greeneru

an increase of million in cash proceeds related to the sale of certain assets in southeastern massachusetts in the first quarter of the fiscal year ended april  payments on landfill operating lease contracts 
lower payments of million for landfill operating lease contracts in the fiscal year ended april  this was due to the timing of certain payments along with additional payments made to amend the operating agreement for the chemung landfill in fiscal year proceeds from the sale of property and equipment 
a million decrease in cash proceeds from the sale of property and equipment 
capital expenditures 
higher capital expenditures of million in the fiscal year ended april  related primarily to recycling facility upgrades and a landfill gas to energy project

net cash used in financing activities 
cash flows provided by used in financing activities increased million and decreased by million for the fiscal years ended april  and  respectively 
the most significant items affecting the change in our financing cash flows for the fiscal year ended april  are summarized below debt activity 
decreased debt borrowings of million more than offset by decreased debt payments of million in the fiscal year ended april  the decrease in long term borrowings is primarily the result of the offering of the notes in fiscal year the decrease in principal payments is primarily the result of the pay down of the senior secured term b loan due april  and the redemption of the notes in fiscal year the most significant items affecting the change in our financing cash flows for the fiscal year ended april  are summarized below debt activity 
the increase in cash used relates primarily to the million pay down of the senior secured term b loan due april  in the fourth quarter of fiscal year offset by additional borrowings including the notes 
net cash provided by discontinued operations 
cash flows provided by discontinued operations decreased million and increased million for the fiscal years ended april  and  respectively 
these fluctuations in net cash flows provided by discontinued operations is primarily the result of two separate transactions in fiscal year  the sale of non integrated recycling assets and select intellectual property assets for million in gross proceeds and the sale of the trilogy glass business for million in cash proceeds 

table of contents we generally meet liquidity needs from operating cash flow and the revolver 
these liquidity needs are primarily for capital expenditures for vehicles  containers and landfill development  debt service costs and capping  closure and post closure expenditures and acquisitions 
our strategy to hedge against fluctuations in variable interest rates involves entering into interest rate derivative agreements to hedge against adverse movements in interest rates 
in fiscal year  we entered into two forward starting interest rate derivative agreements to hedge the interest rate risk associated with a forecasted transaction effective january  the proceeds associated with the forecasted transaction would be used to redeem our outstanding million second lien notes due the second lien notes become callable on july  the total notional amount of these agreements is million and requires us to receive interest based on changes in the london interbank offered rate libor index and pay interest at a rate of approximately 
the agreements mature in march of  which is when the revolver becomes due 
we use a variety of strategies to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in commodity prices including entering into fixed price contracts and entering into hedges which mitigate the variability in cash flows generated from the sales of recycled paper at floating prices  resulting in a fixed price being received from these sales 
as of april   we were not party to any commodity hedging agreements 
for further discussion on commodity price volatility  see item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price volatility below 
we have filed a universal shelf registration statement with the sec pursuant to which we may from time to time issue securities in an amount of up to million 
our ability and willingness to issue securities pursuant to this registration statement will depend on market conditions at the time of any such desired offering and therefore we may not be able to issue such securities on favorable terms  if at all 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of april  in millions and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years fiscal year s ending april  thereafter total long term debt financing lease obligations interest obligations operating leases capping closure post closure total contractual cash obligations interest obligations based on debt and capital lease balances as of april  interest obligations related to variable rate debt were calculated using variable rates in effect at april  includes obligations related to landfill operating lease contracts 
contractual cash obligations do not include accounts payable or accrued liabilities  which will be paid in fiscal year in addition to the above obligations  we have unrecognized tax benefits at april  of approximately million 
due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with the unrecognized tax benefits at april   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates as to the timing of cash settlements 

table of contents inflation and prevailing economic conditions to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations 
consistent with industry practice  most of our contracts provide for a pass through of certain costs  including increases in landfill tipping fees and  in some cases  fuel costs 
we have implemented a fuel surcharge program  which is designed to recover escalating fuel price fluctuations above an expected floor 
we therefore believe we should be able to implement price increases sufficient to offset most cost increases resulting from inflation 
however  competitive factors may require us to absorb at least a portion of these cost increases  particularly during periods of high inflation 
our business is located in the northeastern united states 
therefore  our business  financial condition and results of operations are susceptible to downturns in the general economy in this geographic region and other factors affecting the region  such as state regulations and severe weather conditions 
we are unable to forecast or determine the timing and or the future impact of a sustained economic slowdown 
limitations on ownership of notes pursuant to the first paragraph of section of the indentures governing the second lien notes  section of the notes and the provisions of the converted bonds  no beneficial holder of the second lien notes  notes and or converted bonds is permitted to knowingly acquire second lien notes  notes and or converted bonds if such person would own or more of the consolidated debt for which relevant subsidiaries of ours are obligated and must dispose of second lien notes  notes and converted bonds or other debt of ours to the extent such person becomes aware of exceeding such threshold  if such ownership would require consent of any regulatory authority under applicable law or regulation governing solid waste operators and such consent has not been obtained 
we will furnish to the holders of the second lien notes  notes and converted bonds  in each quarterly and annual report  the dollar amount of our debt that would serve as the threshold for evaluating a beneficial holder s compliance with these ownership restrictions 
as of april   that dollar amount was million 
critical accounting estimates and assumptions the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  as applicable  at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments which are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of their evaluation form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and circumstances 
our significant accounting policies are more fully discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
landfills the cost estimates for capping  closure and post closure activities at landfills for which we have responsibility are estimated based on our interpretations of current requirements and proposed or anticipated regulatory changes 
we also estimate additional costs based on the amount a third party would charge us to perform such activities even when we expect to perform these activities internally 
we estimate the airspace to be consumed related to each capping event and the timing of construction related to each capping event and of closure and post closure activities 
because landfill capping  closure and post closure obligations are measured at estimated fair value using present value techniques  changes in the estimated timing of construction of future landfill capping and closure and post closure activities would have an effect on these liabilities  related assets and results of operations 
landfill development costs we estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity 
this estimate includes such costs as landfill liner material and installation  excavation for airspace  landfill leachate collection systems  landfill gas collection systems  environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas  directly related engineering  capitalized interest  on site road construction and other capital infrastructure costs 
additionally  landfill development includes all land purchases for landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property 
the projection of these landfill costs is dependent  in part  on future events 
the remaining amortizable basis of each landfill includes costs to develop a site to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity and includes amounts previously expended and capitalized  net of accumulated airspace amortization  and projections of future purchase and development costs 
under life cycle accounting  all costs related to acquisition and construction of landfill sites are capitalized and charged to expense based on tonnage placed into each site 
landfill permitting  acquisition and preparation costs are amortized on the units of 
table of contents consumption method as landfill airspace is consumed 
in determining the amortization rate for these landfills  preparation costs include the total estimated costs to complete construction of the landfills permitted and expansion capacity 
landfill capping costs capping includes installation of liners  drainage  compacted soil layers and topsoil over areas of a landfill where total airspace has been consumed and waste is no longer being received 
capping activities occur throughout the life of the landfill 
our engineering personnel estimate the cost for each capping event based on the acreage to be capped and the capping materials and activities required 
the estimates also consider when these costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates 
the engineers then quantify the landfill capacity associated with each capping event and the costs for each event are amortized over that capacity as waste is received at the landfill 
landfill closure and post closure closure and post closure costs represent future estimated costs related to monitoring and maintenance of a solid waste landfill  after a landfill facility ceases to accept waste and closes 
we estimate  based on input from our engineers  lawyers  accounting personnel and consultants  our future cost requirements for closure and post closure monitoring and maintenance based on our interpretation of the technical standards of the subtitle d regulations and the air emissions standards under the clean air act as they are being applied on a state by state basis 
significant reductions in our estimates of the remaining lives of our landfills or significant increases in our estimates of the landfill closure and post closure maintenance costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in determining estimated future closure and post closure costs  we consider costs associated with permitted and expansion airspace 
remaining permitted airspace our engineers  in consultation with third party engineering consultants and surveyors  are responsible for determining remaining permitted airspace at our landfills 
the remaining permitted airspace is determined by an annual survey  which is then used to compare the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill topography 
expansion airspace we include currently unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances 
to be considered expansion airspace all of the following criteria must be met we control the land on which the expansion is sought  all technical siting criteria have been met or a variance has been obtained or is reasonably expected to be obtained  we have not identified any legal or political impediments which we believe will not be resolved in our favor  we are actively working on obtaining any necessary permits and we expect that all required permits will be received  and senior management has approved the project 
for unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace  the expansion effort must meet all of the criteria listed above 
these criteria are annually evaluated by our engineers  accountants  lawyers  managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits 
once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is determined in cubic yards  an airspace utilization factor  or auf  is established to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion capacity in tons 
the auf is established using the measured density obtained from previous annual surveys 
when we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of remaining permitted and expansion airspace  we also include the projected costs for development  as well as the projected asset retirement costs related to capping  and closure and post closure of the expansion airspace in the amortization basis of the landfill 
after determining the costs and the remaining permitted and expansion capacity at each of our landfills  we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed as waste is received and deposited at the landfill by dividing the costs by the corresponding number of tons 
we 
table of contents calculate per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with each capping event  for assets related to closure and post closure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future 
these rates per ton are updated annually  or more often  as significant facts change 
it is possible that actual results  including the amount of costs incurred  the timing of capping  closure and post closure activities  our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions 
to the extent that such estimates  or related assumptions  prove to be significantly different than actual results  lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates  higher capping  closure or post closure rates  or higher expenses  or higher profitability may result if the opposite occurs 
most significantly  if it is determined that the expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of the landfill asset  we may be required to recognize an asset impairment 
if it is determined that the likelihood of receiving an expansion permit has become remote  the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately 
environmental remediation liabilities recorded environmental liabilities represent our estimate of the most likely outcome of the matters for which we have determined liability is probable 
these liabilities include potentially responsible party  or prp  investigations  settlements  certain legal and consultant fees  as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up  such as materials and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy 
we provide for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
we estimate costs required to remediate sites where it is probable that a liability has been incurred based on site specific facts and circumstances 
estimates of the cost for the likely remedy are developed using third party environmental engineers or other service providers 
goodwill and other intangibles we do not amortize goodwill 
we annually assess goodwill impairment at the end of the fourth quarter of our fiscal year  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist 
we assess whether a goodwill impairment exists using both qualitative and quantitative assessments 
our qualitative assessment involves determining whether events or circumstances exist that indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if based on this qualitative assessment we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  we will not perform a quantitative assessment 
if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or if we elect not to perform a qualitative assessment  we perform a quantitative assessment or two step impairment test to determine whether a goodwill impairment exists at the reporting unit 
in the first step of testing for goodwill impairment  we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit  which we have determined to be our geographic operating segments and recycling  and compare the fair value with the carrying value of the net assets assigned to each reporting unit 
we test goodwill at this reporting unit level because the business is managed and reported at this level 
if the fair value is less than its carrying value  then we would perform a second step and determine the fair value of the goodwill 
in this second step  the fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole  as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the purchase price were being initially allocated 
if the fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value for a reporting unit  an impairment charge would be recorded to earnings 
to determine the fair value of each of our reporting units as a whole we use discounted cash flow analyses  which require significant assumptions and estimates about the future operations of each reporting unit 
significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the determination of appropriate discount rates  the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and growth rates 
the cash flows employed in our discounted cash flow analyses are based on financial forecasts developed internally by management 
our discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of our risk adjusted discount rate  applicable for each reporting unit 
in assessing the reasonableness of our determined fair values of our reporting units  we evaluate our results against our current market capitalization 
in addition  we would evaluate a reporting unit for impairment if events or circumstances change between annual tests indicating a possible impairment 
examples of such events or circumstances include the following a significant adverse change in legal status or in the business climate  
table of contents an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  a more likely than not expectation that a segment or a significant portion thereof will be sold  or the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within the segment 
we incurred no impairment of goodwill as a result of our annual fourth quarter goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years  or however  there can be no assurance that goodwill will not be impaired at any time in the future 
as of april   the qualitative assessment performed for the western reporting unit indicated that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount  including goodwill  and  therefore  no step one was performed 
the step test indicated that fair value of the recycling reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 
the carrying value of the eastern reporting unit goodwill is de minimus and its impact to our operating results would be immaterial 
see note and note to our consolidated financial statements included under item of this form k for further disclosure 
recovery of long lived assets we continually consider whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that may warrant revision of the estimated useful lives of our long lived assets other than goodwill or whether the remaining balances of those assets should be evaluated for possible impairment 
long lived assets include  for example  capitalized landfill costs  other property and equipment  and identifiable intangible assets 
events or changes in circumstances that may indicate that an asset may be impaired include the following a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or asset group  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset or asset group  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long lived asset  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset or asset group  a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life  or an impairment of goodwill at a reporting unit 
there are certain indicators listed above that require significant judgment and understanding of the waste industry when applied to landfill development or expansion 
for example  a regulator may initially deny a landfill expansion permit application although the expansion permit is ultimately granted 
in addition  management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace 
therefore  certain events could occur in the ordinary course of business and not necessarily be considered indicators of impairment due to the unique nature of the waste industry 
if an impairment indicator occurs  we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows 
we group our long lived assets for this purpose at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets or asset groups 
if the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows  we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value 
to determine fair value we use discounted cash flow analyses and estimates about the future cash flows of the asset or asset group 
this analysis includes a determination of an appropriate discount rate  the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and growth rates 
the cash flows employed in our discounted cash flow analyses are typically based on financial forecasts developed 
table of contents internally by management 
the discount rate used is commensurate with the risks involved 
we may also rely on third party valuations and or information available regarding the market value for similar assets 
if the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group  impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment occurs 
estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized
