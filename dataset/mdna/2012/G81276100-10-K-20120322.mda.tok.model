exchange translation impact the average exchange rate is used to prepare the income statement and is calculated from the weekly average exchange rates weighted by sales of the uk division 
this means that results are particularly impacted by movements in the fourth quarter of its fiscal year  with the exchange rate in the first four weeks of december having the largest effect on the average exchange rate used 
a movement in the year to date exchange rate from that in the prior quarter in a particular fiscal year  will result in that quarter s results being impacted by adjustments to sales and costs in prior quarters to reflect the changed year to date exchange rate 
this can have a particularly noticeable impact on signet s results for the third quarter as the results for the third quarter are close to break even 
in addition  as the uk division s selling  administrative and general expenses are spread more evenly between quarters than its sales  these expenses can be particularly impacted in the fourth quarter 
in fiscal  it is anticipated a one cent movement in the pound sterling to us dollar exchange rate would impact income before income tax by approximately million

drivers of operating profitability the key drivers of operating profitability are sales performance  gross margin  level of selling  general and administrative expenses  balance between the change in same store sales and sales from new store space  and movements in the us dollar to pound sterling exchange rate  as about of signet s sales and about of operating income  including unallocated costs  were generated in the uk in fiscal and signet reports its results in us dollars 
these and other drivers are discussed more fully below 
sales sales performance in both the us and uk divisions is driven by the change in same store sales and net store space 
same store sales growth is calculated by comparison of sales in stores that were open in both the current and the prior fiscal year 
sales from stores that have been open for less than months are excluded from the comparison until their month anniversary 
sales from the month anniversary onwards are compared against the equivalent prior period sales within the comparable store sales comparison 
stores closed in the current financial period are included up to the date of closure and the comparative period is correspondingly adjusted 
stores that have been relocated or expanded  but remain within the same local geographic market  are included within the comparison with no adjustment to either the current or comparative period 
stores that have been refurbished are also included within the comparison except for the period when the refurbishment was taking place  when those stores are excluded from the comparison both for the current year and for the comparative period 
sales to employees are also excluded 
comparisons at divisional level are made in local currency and consolidated comparisons are made at constant exchange rates and exclude the effect of exchange rate movements by recalculating the prior period results as if they had been generated at the weighted average exchange rate for the current period 
ecommerce sales are included in the calculation of sales for the period and the comparative figures from the anniversary of the launch of the relevant website 
management considers same store sales useful as it is a major benchmark used by investors to judge performance within the retail industry 
same store sales are a function of the number of units sold and the average selling price of those units 
the average selling price can vary due to changes in the buying patterns of customers  the introduction of new merchandise  the relative growth rates of different store formats  or price changes 
the charm bracelet category 
table of contents which drives multiple unit purchases and increased frequency of purchases  as compared to diamonds  grew rapidly in fiscal and fiscal the significant growth of this category has increased sales  as unit volumes increased and average selling price per unit declined 
signet seeks to provide customers with a broad range of prices and merchandise choices to ensure customers can purchase compelling products at a variety of price levels and adjusts the product mix for evolving product trends based upon evaluation of customer demand and customer testing 
a new us store typically has sales ranging from to of a five year old store  and will only contribute to sales for part of the fiscal year in which it is opened 
store openings are usually planned to occur in the third quarter  and store closures in january  although this does not always occur 
when investing in new space  management has stringent operating and financial criteria 
us net space increased in fiscal and decreased by in fiscal this is in contrast to net space growth in the us of in fiscal and in fiscal the majority of the historic space growth reflected expansion of the jared format 
in the uk  there has typically been a small decline in space as the h 
samuel chain has withdrawn from smaller sized retail markets due to growth in regional malls 
there are currently limited new space opportunities for either h 
samuel or ernest jones to offset these closures 
uk space remained unchanged in fiscal and decreased by in fiscal net change in store selling space us uk signet fiscal openings closures net change fiscal openings closures net change fiscal openings closures net change cost of sales and gross margin cost of sales  includes merchandise costs net of discounts and allowances  freight  processing and distribution costs of moving merchandise from suppliers to the distribution center and to stores  inventory shrinkage  store operating and occupancy costs  net bad debts and charges for late payments under the us customer finance program 
store operating and occupancy costs include utilities  rent  real estate taxes  common area maintenance charges and depreciation 
as the classification of cost of sales or selling  general and administrative expenses varies from retailer to retailer and few retailers have in house customer finance programs  signet s gross margin percentage may not be directly comparable to other retailers 
the gross merchandise margin is the difference between the selling price achieved and the cost of merchandise sold expressed as a percentage of the sales price 
gross merchandise margin dollars is the difference expressed in monetary terms 
the trend in gross merchandise margin depends on signet s pricing policy  movements in the cost of merchandise sold  changes in sales mix and the direct cost of providing services such as repairs 
important factors that impact gross margin are the cost of polished diamonds and gold 
in the us division  about of the cost of merchandise sold is accounted for by polished diamonds and about is accounted for by gold 
in the uk division  diamonds and gold account for about to and about to  respectively  of the cost of 
table of contents merchandise sold  and watches for about 
the pound sterling to us dollar exchange rate also has a material impact as a significant proportion of the merchandise sold in the uk is purchased in us dollars 
signet uses gold and currency hedges to reduce its exposure to market volatility in the cost of gold and the pound sterling to dollar exchange rate  but is not able to do so for polished diamonds 
for gold and currencies  the hedging period can extend to months  although the majority of hedge contracts will normally be for a maximum of months 
the price of diamonds varies depending on their size  cut  color and clarity 
the price of diamonds of the size and quality typically purchased by signet showed little variation over fiscal years and due to the sharp decline in demand for diamonds in the second half of fiscal  particularly in the us which accounts for about of worldwide diamond demand source idex online idex  the supply chain became overstocked with diamonds 
combined with the reduced levels of credit availability  the oversupply of diamonds resulted in a fall in the price of loose polished diamonds of all sizes and qualities for most of fiscal the idex global diamond price index is an independent source that tracks diamond prices in the idex inventory database 
while idex tracks price movements in its database  they are not representative of all transactions in polished diamonds and do not necessarily reflect prices paid by signet 
idex reports show that the price of diamonds over three carats  which is larger than signet usually purchases  are more volatile than for sizes and qualities that are typically used in merchandise sold by signet 
during fiscal  polished diamond prices increased  but remained below fiscal levels 
in mid fiscal  the idex global diamond price index exceeded its prior peak levels  and while falling back in the second half of fiscal  remained above fiscal levels 
demand for diamonds is primarily driven by the manufacture and sale of diamond jewelry and their future price is uncertain 
the cost of gold  while volatile  has steadily increased during the last four fiscal years  primarily reflecting increased investment demand rather than changes in the usage for jewelry manufacture 
during fiscal  the cost of gold increased from an average of  per troy ounce in january to  per troy ounce in january the future price of gold is uncertain 
signet uses an average cost inventory methodology and  as jewelry inventory turns slowly  the impact of movements in the cost of diamonds and gold takes some time to be fully reflected in the gross margin 
as inventory turn is faster in the fourth quarter than in the other three quarters  changes in the cost of merchandise are more quickly reflected in the gross margin in that quarter 
furthermore  signet s hedging activities result in movements in the purchase cost of merchandise taking some time before being reflected in the gross margin 
an increase in inventory turn would accelerate the rate at which commodity costs impact gross margin 
customer receivables comprise a large volume of transactions with no one customer representing a significant balance 
the net us bad debt expense includes an estimate of the allowance for losses as of the balance sheet date 
the allowance is calculated using a proprietary model that analyzes factors such as delinquency rates and recovery rates 
a allowance is made for any amount that is more than days aged on a recency basis  as well as an allowance for those days aged and under based on historical loss information and performance and payment performance 
management believes that the primary drivers of the net us bad debt to total us sales ratio are the accuracy of the proprietary consumer credit scores used when granting customer finance  the procedures used to collect the outstanding balances  us credit sales as a percentage of total us sales and the rate of change in the level of unemployment in the us economy 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses include store staff and store administrative costs  centralized administrative expenses  including information technology  credit and ecommerce  advertising and promotional costs and other operating expenses not specifically categorized elsewhere in the consolidated income statements 
the primary drivers of staffing costs are the number of full time equivalent employees employed and the level of compensation  taxes and other benefits paid 
management varies  on a store by store basis  the hours worked 
table of contents based on the expected level of selling activity  subject to minimum staffing levels required to operate the store 
non store staffing levels are less variable 
a significant element of compensation is performance based  and is primarily dependent on sales or operating profit 
the level of advertising expenditure can vary 
the largest element of advertising expenditure is national television advertising and is determined by management s judgment of the appropriate level of advertising impressions and the cost of purchasing media 
other operating income other operating income is predominantly interest income arising from in house customer finance provided to signet s customers by the us division 
its level is dependent on the rate of interest charged and the level of outstanding balances 
the level of outstanding balances is dependent on the sales of the us division  the proportion of sales that use the in house customer finance and the monthly collection rate 
operating income to maintain operating income  signet needs to achieve same store sales growth sufficient to offset any adverse movement in gross margin including the net bad debt expense  any increase in operating costs  the impact of any immature selling space and any adverse changes in other operating income 
same store sales growth above the level required to offset the factors outlined above allows the business to achieve leverage of its cost base and improve operating income 
slower sales growth or a sales decline would normally result in reduced operating income 
when foreseen  such as through the us division s cost saving measures implemented in fiscal  signet may be able to reduce costs to help offset the impact of slow or negative sales growth 
a key factor in driving operating income is the level of average sales per store  with higher productivity allowing leverage of expenses incurred in performing store and central functions 
therefore a slower rate of net new space growth is beneficial to operating income  while an acceleration in growth is adverse 
the impact on operating income of a sharp  unexpected increase or decrease in same store sales performance can be significant 
this is particularly so when it occurs in the fourth quarter due to the seasonality of the business 
in the medium term  there is more opportunity to adjust costs to the changed sales level  but the time it takes varies depending on the type of cost 
an example of where it can take a number of months to adjust costs is expenditure on national network television advertising in the us  where signet makes most of its commitments for the year ahead during its second quarter 
it is even more difficult to reduce base lease costs in the short or medium term  as leases in us malls are typically for ten years  jared sites for years and in the uk for five plus years 
operating income may also be impacted by significant  unusual and non recurring items 
for example  in fiscal  the impact of amendments to the truth in lending act had an estimated net direct adverse impact on operating income of million  primarily by reducing other operating income 
in fiscal  the vacation entitlement policy in the us division was changed  which resulted in the selling  general and administrative costs being reduced  while operating income increased by million 
other line items may also be impacted by significant  unusual and non recurring items 
for example  in fiscal  signet made a make whole payment of million  reflected as an increase to interest expense as a result of the prepayment in full of private placement notes in november

operating activities provide the primary source of cash and are influenced by a number of factors  such as net income  which is primarily influenced by sales and operating income margins  changes in the level of inventory  
table of contents proportion of us sales made using in house customer financing programs and the average monthly collection rate of the credit balances  seasonal pattern of sales  and working capital movements associated with changes in store space 
other sources of cash would be borrowings or the issuance of common shares for cash 
net cash provided by operating activities as a retail business  signet receives cash when it makes a sale to a customer or when the payment has been processed by the relevant bank if the payment is made by credit or debit card 
in the us division  if the customer makes use of financing provided by signet  the cash is received over a period of time 
in fiscal  fiscal of the us division s sales were made using customer financing provided by signet 
the average monthly collection rate from the us customer in house finance receivables was fiscal 
signet typically pays for merchandise about days after receipt 
due to the nature of specialty retail jewelry  it is usual for inventory to be held on average for approximately months before it is sold 
in addition  signet holds consignment inventory  nearly all of which is in the us  which at january  amounted to million january  million 
the principal terms of the consignment agreement  which can generally be terminated by either party  are such that signet can return any or all of the inventory to the relevant supplier without financial or commercial penalties 
when signet sells consignment inventory  it becomes liable to the supplier for the cost of the item 
the sale of any such inventory is accounted for on a gross basis see principal accounting policies  item 
signet s largest class of operating expense relates to store and central payroll and benefits 
these are typically paid on a weekly  biweekly or monthly basis  with annual bonus payments also being made 
operating lease payments in respect of stores occupied are normally paid on a monthly basis by the us division and on a quarterly basis by the uk division 
payment for advertising on television  radio or in newspapers is usually made between and days after the advertisement appears 
other expenses have various payment terms  none of which are material 
signet s working capital requirements fluctuate during the year as a result of the seasonal nature of sales  and movements in the pound sterling to us dollar exchange rate 
the working capital needs of the business normally decline from january to august  as inventory and accounts receivable decrease from seasonal peaks 
as inventory is purchased for the fourth quarter  there is a working capital outflow which reaches its highest levels in mid to late november 
the peak level of working capital is typically million to million above the typical january to august level  and can be accentuated by new store openings 
the working capital position then reverses over the holiday season 
the change in inventory is primarily driven by the sales performance of the existing stores  the net change in store space and the seasonal pattern of sales 
changes in the sourcing practices  commodity costs  and merchandise mix of the business can also result in changes in inventory 
the value of inventory in the uk division is also impacted by movements in the pound sterling to us dollar exchange rate 
the change in us customer in house finance receivables proportionately reflect changes in sales if credit participation levels remain the same and receivable collection rates were unaltered 
changes in credit participation and the collection rate also impact the level of receivables 
movements in deferred revenue reflect the level of us sales and the attachment rate of service plan sales 
therefore if sales increase  working capital would be expected to increase 
similarly  a decrease in sales would be expected to result in a reduction in working capital 
investment in new space requires significant investment in working capital  as well as fixed capital investment  due to the inventory turn  and the additional investment required to fund sales in the us utilizing in house 
table of contents customer finance 
of the total investment required to open a new store in the us  between and is typically accounted for by working capital 
new stores are usually opened in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter of a fiscal year 
a reduction in the number of store openings results in the difference between the level of funding required in the first half of a fiscal year and the peak level being lower  while an increase in the number of store openings would have the opposite impact 
in fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was million fiscal million  an increase of million 
net income increased by million to million fiscal million  with depreciation and amortization reducing by million to million fiscal million 
in fiscal  accounts receivable increased by million fiscal million  reflecting increased sales and a higher rate of in house customer financing 
inventory levels were up by million fiscal million  while sales increased by 
this reflected timing of inventory purchases  the impact of higher diamond and gold costs partly offset by management action to improve the inventory turn 
other movements in operating assets and liabilities in fiscal primarily reflect increased income taxes payable reflecting signet s performance 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  due to the seasonal sales pattern  accounts receivable increased by million weeks to january  million and inventory decreased by million weeks to january  million 
investing activities investment activities primarily reflect the purchases of property and equipment related to the rate of space expansion in the us  investment in existing stores  reflecting the level of investment in sales enhancing technology  and the number of store refurbishments and relocations carried out  and investment in divisional head offices and systems  which include the us and uk distribution facilities  and purchases of intangible assets  primarily of information technology software 
when evaluating new store investment  management uses an investment hurdle rate of a internal rate of return on a pre tax basis over a five year period  assuming the release of working capital at the end of the five years 
capital expenditure accounts for about of the investment in a new store in the us division 
the balance is accounted for by investment in inventory and the funding of customer financing 
signet typically carries out a major refurbishment of its stores every ten years but does have some discretion as to the timing of such expenditure 
a major store refurbishment is evaluated using the same investment procedures as for a new store 
minor store redecorations are typically carried out every five years 
in addition to major store refurbishments  signet carries out minor store refurbishments where stores are profitable but do not satisfy the investment hurdle rate required for a full refurbishment  this is usually associated with a short term lease renewal 
where possible  the investment appraisal approach is also used to evaluate other investment opportunities

the principal terms of the consignment agreements  which can generally be terminated by either party  are such that signet can return any  or all of  the inventory to the relevant supplier without financial or commercial penalty 
contingent property liabilities at january   approximately uk property leases had been assigned by signet to third parties and remained unexpired and occupied by assignees at that date and approximately additional properties were sub let at that date 
should the assignees or sub tenants fail to fulfill any obligations in respect of those leases or any other leases which have at any other time been assigned or sub let  signet or one of its uk subsidiaries may be liable for those defaults 
the number of such claims arising to date has been small  and the liability  which is charged to the income statement as it arises  has not been material 
contractual obligations a summary of operating lease obligations is set out below

impact of inflation the impact of inflation on signet s results for the past three years has not been significant apart from the impact of the increased commodity costs  and in the uk  the impact on merchandise costs due to the weakness of the pound sterling against the us dollar 
impact of climate change signet recognizes that climate change is a major risk to society and therefore continues to take steps to reduce signet s climatic impact

critical accounting policies critical accounting policies covering areas of greater complexity or those particularly subject to the exercise of judgment are listed below 
there are no material off balance sheet structures 
the principal accounting policies are set out in the financial statements in item revenue recognition revenue from the sale of extended service plans is deferred and recognized over a year period with approximately recognized within the first two years  representing the anticipated period of claims arising under the plans 
signet reviews the patterns of claims  including estimates of future claims costs expected to be incurred  to determine the appropriate deferral period for revenue recognition 
all direct costs associated with the sale of these plans are deferred and amortized in proportion to the revenue recognized 
management reviews the trends in current and estimated future claims to assess whether changes are required to the revenue and cost recognition rates used 
in connection with certain promotions  the company gives customers making a purchase a voucher granting the customers a discount on a future purchase  redeemable within a stated time frame 
the company accounts for such vouchers by allocating the fair value of the voucher between the initial purchase and the future purchase 

table of contents the fair value of the voucher is determined based on the average sales transactions in which the vouchers were issued and the estimated average sales transactions when the vouchers are expected to be redeemed  combined with the estimated voucher redemption rate 
the fair value allocated to the future purchase is recorded as deferred revenue 
the deferred revenue that represents income under extended service plans  voucher promotions and other items at the end of fiscal was million fiscal million 
provision is made for future returns expected within the stated return period  based on previous percentage return rates experienced 
depreciation and impairment property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation  amortization and impairment losses 
maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred 
depreciation and amortization are provided on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets as follows buildings to years when land is owned or remaining term of lease  not to exceed to years leasehold improvements remaining term of lease  not to exceed years furniture and fixtures ranging from years equipment  including software ranging from years in the uk  there are circumstances where refurbishments are carried out close to the end of the lease term  such that the expected life of the newly installed leasehold improvements will exceed the lease term 
where the renewal of the lease is reasonably assured  such storefronts  fixtures and fittings are depreciated over a period equal to the lesser of their economic useful life  or the remaining lease term plus the period of reasonably assured renewal 
reasonable assurance is gained through evaluation of the right to enter into a new lease  the performance of the store and potential availability of alternative sites 
where appropriate  impairments are recorded for the amount by which the assets have a fair value less than net book value 
management has identified potentially impaired assets considering the cash flows of individual stores where trading since the initial opening of the store has reached a mature stage 
where such stores deliver negative cash flows  the related store assets have been considered for impairment by reference to estimated future cash flows for these stores 
in fiscal  the income statement includes a charge of million for impairment of assets fiscal million 
taxation accruals for income tax contingencies require management to make judgments and estimates in relation to tax audit issues and exposures 
amounts reserved are based on management s interpretation of jurisdiction specific tax law and the likelihood of settlement 
tax benefits are not recognized unless the tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained 
once recognized  management reviews each material tax benefit taking account of potential settlement through negotiation and or litigation 
any recorded exposure to interest and penalties on tax liabilities is included in the income tax charge 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are stated net of an allowance for uncollectible balances 
this allowance is based on signet s past experience and the payment history of customers  which reflect the prevailing economic environment 
the allowance at january  was million against a gross accounts receivable balance of  million 
this compares to a valuation allowance of million against a gross accounts receivable balance of  million at january  management regularly reviews its receivable balances and when it assesses that a balance is not recoverable  it is fully written off 
signet provides credit facilities to customers upon completing appropriate credit tests 

table of contents interest earned from the us customer in house finance program is classified as other operating income 
inventory valuation inventory is valued on an average cost basis and includes appropriate overheads 
overheads allocated to inventory cost are only those directly related to bringing inventory to its present location and condition 
these include relevant warehousing  distribution and certain buying  security and data processing costs 
where necessary  inventory is written down for obsolete  slow moving and damaged items 
this write down represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value  based upon inventory turn rates  market conditions and trends in customer demand 
the total inventory reserve at january  was million fiscal million 
total net inventory at january  was  million  an increase of million on january  in the us  reserves for physical inventory losses are estimated and recorded throughout the year as a percentage of net sales based on historical physical inventory results  expectations of future inventory losses and current inventory levels 
a physical inventory is performed at the mid year and fiscal year end after for which the physical inventory reserves are adjusted for actual results 
in the uk  inventory losses are recorded as identified on a perpetual inventory system and an estimate is made of losses for the period from the last inventory count date to the end of the fiscal year on a store by store basis 
these estimates are based on the overall divisional inventory loss experience since the last inventory count 
hedge accounting changes in the fair value of financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognized directly in equity through the statement of accumulated other comprehensive income 
any ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognized immediately in the income statement 
uk retirement benefits the expected liabilities of the uk plan are calculated based primarily on assumptions regarding salary and pension increases  inflation rates  discount rates  projected life expectancy and the long term rate of return expected on the uk plan s assets 
a full actuarial valuation was completed as of april  and the uk plan valuation is updated at each year end 
the discount rate assumption of applied for fiscal is based on the yield at the balance sheet date of long dated aa rated corporate bonds of equivalent currency and term to the uk plan s liabilities 
a increase in this discount rate would decrease the net periodic benefit cost of million in fiscal by million 
the value of the assets of the uk plan is measured as of the balance sheet date  which is particularly dependent on the value of equity investments held at that date 
the overall impact on the consolidated balance sheet is significantly mitigated as the members of the uk plan are only in the uk and account for about of uk employees 
the uk plan ceased to admit new employees as of april in addition  if net accumulated actuarial gains and losses exceed of the greater of plan assets or plan liabilities  signet amortizes those gains or losses that exceed this over the average remaining service period of the employees

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk signet is exposed to market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  certain commodity prices and interest rates 
signet monitors and manages these market exposures as a fundamental part of its overall risk management program  which recognizes the volatility of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects of this volatility on signet s operating results 
market risk management policy a committee of the board is responsible for the implementation of market risk management policies within the treasury policies and guidelines framework  which are deemed to be appropriate by the board for the management of market risk 
signet s exposure to market risk is managed by the signet s treasury committee  consisting of signet s chief executive officer  chief financial officer and treasurer 
where deemed necessary to achieve the objective of reducing market risk volatility on signet s operating results  certain derivative instruments are entered into after review and approval by the treasury committee 
signet uses derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes only 
a description of signet s accounting policies for derivative instruments is included in note of item signet s current portfolio of derivative financial instruments consists of forward foreign currency exchange contracts  forward contracts for the purchase of gold and option contracts for the purchase of gold 
an analysis quantifying the fair value change in derivative financial instruments held by signet to manage its exposure to foreign exchange rates  commodity prices and interest rates is detailed in note of item foreign currency exchange rate risk in fiscal  some of total assets were held in us dollars at january  and approximately of its sales and of its operating income were generated in us dollars 
nearly all the remainder of signet s assets  sales and operating income are in pounds sterling 
in translating the results of its uk operations  signet s results are subject to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the pound sterling and the us dollar 
any depreciation in the weighted average value of the us dollar against the pound sterling could increase reported revenues and operating profit and any appreciation in the weighted average value of the us dollar against the pound sterling could decrease reported revenues and operating profit 
the board has chosen not to hedge the translation effect of exchange rate movements on signet s operating results 
the uk division buys certain products and materials on international markets that are priced in us dollars  and therefore has an exposure to exchange rates on the cost of goods sold 
signet uses certain derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of this exposure  within treasury guidelines approved by the board 
signet holds a fluctuating amount of pounds sterling cash reflecting the cash generating characteristics of the uk division 
signet s objective is to minimize net foreign exchange exposure to the income statement on pound sterling denominated items through managing this level of cash  pound sterling denominated intercompany balances and us dollar to pound sterling swaps 
in order to manage the foreign exchange exposure and minimize the level of pound sterling cash held by signet  the pound sterling denominated subsidiaries pay dividends regularly to their immediate holding companies and excess pounds sterling are sold in exchange for us dollars 

table of contents commodity price risk commodity price risk is the possibility of higher or lower costs due to changes in the prices of commodities 
signet s results are subject to fluctuations in the underlying cost price of diamonds  gold and certain other precious metals which are key raw material components of the products sold by signet 
it is signet s policy to minimize the impact of precious metal commodity price volatility on operating results through the use of outright forward purchases of  or by entering into options to purchase  precious metals within treasury guidelines approved by the board 
in particular  signet undertakes some hedging of its requirement for gold through the use of options  forward contracts and commodity purchasing  while fluctuations in the cost of diamonds are not hedged 
interest rate risk signet s interest income or charge is exposed to volatility in interest rates 
this exposure is driven by both the currency denomination of the cash or debt us dollars or pounds sterling  the mix of fixed and floating rate debt used  the type of cash investments and the total amount of cash and debt outstanding 
sensitivity analysis management has used a sensitivity analysis technique that measures the change in the fair value of signet s financial instruments from hypothetical changes in market rates as shown in the table below 
fair value changes arising from fair value january  rise in interest rates depreciation of against depreciation of precious metal prices fair value january  million million million million million foreign exchange contracts commodity contracts floating rate borrowings floating rate bank deposits the amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis quantify the impact of market risk assuming that certain adverse market conditions  specified in the table above  occur 
they are not forward looking estimates of market risk 
actual results in the future are likely to differ materially from those projected due to changes in the portfolio of financial instruments held and actual developments in the global financial markets 
any changes in the portfolio of financial instruments held and developments in the global financial markets may cause fluctuations in interest rates  exchange rates and precious metal prices to exceed the hypothetical amounts disclosed in the table above 
the sensitivity scenarios are intended to allow an expected risk measure to be applied to the scenarios  as opposed to the scenarios themselves being an indicator of the maximum expected risk 
the example shown for changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments at january  is set out in the table above 
the fair value of derivative financial instruments is estimated by discounting the future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market rates prevailing at the period end 
the estimated changes in fair values for interest rate movements are based on an increase of basis points in the specific rate of interest applicable to each class of financial instruments from the levels effective at january  with all other variables remaining constant 
the estimated changes in the fair value for foreign exchange rates are based on a depreciation of the pound sterling against us dollar from the levels applicable at january  with all other variables remaining constant
