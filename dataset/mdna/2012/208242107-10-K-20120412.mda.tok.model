general we intend the following discussion and analysis to provide you with a better understanding of the financial condition and performance of our retail and credit segments for the indicated periods  including an analysis of those key factors that contributed to our financial condition and performance and that are  or are expected to be  the key drivers of our business 

table of contents through our retail stores  we provide products and services to our customers in seven primary market areas  including houston  san antonio austin  dallas fort worth  southern louisiana  southeast and south texas and oklahoma 
products and services offered through retail sales outlets include home appliances  consumer electronics  home office equipment  lawn and garden products  mattresses  furniture  repair service agreements  consumer installment credit programs  and various credit insurance products 
these activities are supported through our extensive service  warehouse and distribution system 
our stores bear the conn s name  after our founder s family  and deliver the same products and services to our customers 
all of our stores follow the same procedures and methods in managing their operations 
our management evaluates performance and allocates resources based on the operating results of its retail and credit segments 
we derive the majority of our revenues from our product sales and repair service agreement commissions  which are generated by sales of third party repair service agreements and product replacement policies 
however  unlike many of our competitors  we provide in house credit options for our customers product purchases 
additionally  we derive a portion of our revenues from the sale of credit insurance products of third party insurers to our customers 
in the last three years  we have financed  including down payments received  on average  approximately of our retail sales through our credit programs 
we offer our customers an interest bearing installment financing program and  at times  we offer promotional credit programs to certain of our customers that provide for same as cash or deferred interest interest free periods of varying terms  generally three  six    and months  and require monthly payments beginning in the month after the sale 
in turn  we finance substantially all of our customer receivables from these credit options through our revolving credit facility 
in addition to our own credit programs  we use third party financing programs to provide a portion of the non interest bearing financing for purchases made by our customers  as well as a conn s branded revolving charge card 
we also use a third party provider to offer a rent to own payment option to our customers 
while our warehouse and distribution system does not directly generate revenues  other than the fees paid by our customers for delivery and installation of the products to their homes  it is our extra  value added program that our existing customers have come to rely on  and our new customers are hopefully sufficiently impressed with  to become repeat customers 
we derive revenues from our repair services on the products we sell 
additionally  acting as an agent for unaffiliated companies  we sell credit insurance to protect our customers from credit losses due to death  disability  involuntary unemployment and damage to or loss of the products they have purchased 
application of critical accounting policies in applying the accounting policies that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements  we necessarily make accounting estimates that affect our reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
some of these accounting estimates require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time we make the accounting estimates 
we base these assumptions and the resulting estimates on authoritative pronouncements  historical information and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  and we evaluate these assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis 
we could reasonably use different accounting estimates and changes in our accounting estimates could occur from period to period  with the result in each case being a material change in the financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations 
we refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting estimates 
we believe that the critical accounting estimates discussed below are among those most important to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements 
restructured customer accounts receivable 
effective april   the fasb issued asu no 
 a creditor s determination of whether restructuring is a troubled debt restructuring tdr  which clarifies when a loan modification or restructuring is considered a tdr 
this guidance clarifies what constitutes a concession and whether the debtor is experiencing financial difficulties  even if not currently in default 
the amendments in asu are effective for the first interim or annual period beginning on or after june   or for the third quarter of fiscal for us  and should be applied retrospectively to restructurings occurring on or after the beginning of the annual period of adoption with early adoption permitted 
loan modifications in which an economic concession has been granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty are accounted for and reported as tdrs 
in the quarter ended october   we adopted new accounting guidance that provides clarification on whether a debtor is experiencing financial difficulties and whether a concession has been granted to the debtor for purposes of determining if a loan modification constitutes a tdr 
the adoption applies retrospectively to our loan restructurings after january  the company defines tdr accounts that originated in the current fiscal year as accounts that have been re aged in excess of three months or refinanced 
for accounts originating in prior fiscal years  the accounts must receive additional re aging during this fiscal year and is considered a tdr if the cumulative re aging exceeds three months 
we recorded a pre tax charge of million  net of previously provided reserves  related to the required adoption of the accounting guidance related to tdr accounts 

table of contents customer accounts receivable 
customer accounts receivable are originated at the time of sale and delivery of the various products and services we offer 
we include the amount of principal and accrued interest on those receivables that are expected to be collected within the next twelve months  based on contractual terms  in current assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
those amounts expected to be collected after twelve months  based on contractual terms  are included in long term assets 
typically  customer receivables are considered delinquent if a payment has not been received on the scheduled due date 
additionally  we offer re age programs to customers with past due balances that have experienced a financial hardship  if they meet the conditions of our re age policy 
re aging a customer s account can result in updating it from a delinquent status to a current status 
during the quarter ended july   we implemented a new policy which limits the number of months that an account can be re aged to a maximum of months 
during the quarter ended october   we further modified the policy to reduce the number of months that an account can be re aged to a maximum of months 
as of july   we changed our charge off policy so that an account that is delinquent more than days at each month end is charged off against the allowance for doubtful accounts and interest accrued subsequent to the last payment is reversed and charged to the allowance for uncollectible interest 
prior to july   we charged off all accounts that were delinquent more than days and for which no payment had been received in the past seven months 
we have a secured interest in the merchandise financed by these receivables and therefore have the opportunity to recover a portion of any charged off amount 
as part of our customer retention and expansion efforts  we may modify loans for certain borrowers 
interest income on customer accounts receivable 
interest income is accrued using the interest method for installment contracts  and the simple interest method for revolving charge accounts  and is reflected in finance charges and other 
typically  interest income is accrued until the contract or account is paid off or charged off and we provide an allowance for estimated uncollectible interest 
we typically only place accounts in non accrual status when legally required to do so 
interest accrual is resumed on those accounts once a legally mandated settlement arrangement is reached or other payment arrangements are made with the customer 
interest income is recognized on our interest free promotional accounts based on our historical experience related to customers who fail to satisfy the requirements of the interest free programs 
additionally  for sales on deferred interest and same as cash programs  under our in house finance program  that exceed one year in duration  we discount the sales to their present value  resulting in a reduction in sales and customer receivables  and amortize the discount amount into finance charges and other over the term of the program 
we recognize interest income on tdr accounts using the interest income method  which requires reporting interest income equal to the increase in the net carrying amount of the loan attributable to the passage of time 
cash proceeds and other adjustments are applied to the net carrying amount such that it always equals the present value of expected future cash flows 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts  including estimated uncollectible interest  for our customer and other accounts receivable  based on our historical cash collection and net loss experience and expectations for future cash collections and losses 
in addition to pre charge off cash collections and charge off information  estimates of post charge off recoveries  including cash payments  amounts realized from the repossession of the products financed and  at times  payments received under credit insurance policies are also considered 
we determine reserves for those accounts that are tdrs based on the discounted present value of cash flows expected to be collected over the life of those accounts 
the excess of the carrying amount over the discounted cash flow amount is recorded as a reserve for loss on those accounts 
we estimate our allowance for bad debts by evaluating the credit portfolio based on number of months re aged  if any 
we monitor the aging of our past due accounts closely and focus our collection efforts on preventing accounts from becoming days past due or greater  which is a leading indicator of potential charge off 
as a result of our practice of re aging customer accounts  if the account is not ultimately collected  the timing and amount of the charge off could be impacted 
if these accounts had been charged off sooner the historical net loss rates might have been higher 
during the quarter ended july   we implemented a new policy which limits the number of months that an account can be re aged to a maximum of months which was further limited to a maximum of months during the quarter ended october  as of july   we changed our charge off policy such that an account that is delinquent more than days as of the end of each month is charged off against the allowance for doubtful accounts and interest accrued subsequent to the last payment is reversed and 
table of contents charged against the allowance for uncollectible interest 
prior to july   we charged off all accounts that were delinquent more than days and for which no payment had been received in the past seven months 
the balance in the allowance for doubtful accounts and uncollectible interest for customer receivables was million and million  at january   and  respectively 
the adoption of the tdr guidance in the quarter ended october  resulted in a balance as of january  considered to be tdrs of million 
the amount included in the allowance for doubtful accounts associated with principal and interest on these loans was million as of january  tdr accounts are segregated from the credit score stratification for reporting and measurement purposes 
if the loss rate used to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts on non tdr loan principal and interest reserves was increased by at january   we would have increased our provision for bad debts by approximately million for fiscal the impact of a unfavorable change in the net present value calculation on tdr accounts would increase our provision for bad debts by approximately million as of january  inventories 
inventories consist of finished goods or parts and are valued at the lower of cost moving weighted average cost method or fair market value through the establishment of inventory reserves 
our inventory reserve represents the excess of the carrying amount  typically weighted average cost  over the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or other disposition of the inventory 
the inventory reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding inventory aging  projected consumer demand and market availability and obsolescence of products on hand 
if estimates regarding consumer demand or the net realizable value that can be obtained for certain products is affected in an unforeseen manner  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a difference in our actual inventory reserve at january   would have affected our cost of goods sold by approximately million 
property and equipment impairment 
property and equipment are evaluated for impairment at the retail store level 
the company performs a periodic assessment of assets for impairment 
additionally  an impairment evaluation is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable 
the most likely condition that would necessitate an assessment would be an adverse change in historical and estimated future results of a retail store s performance 
for property and equipment to be held and used  the company recognizes an impairment loss if its carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted cash flows and measures the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and fair value 
fair value is determined by discounting the anticipated cash flows over the remaining term of the lease utilizing certain unobservable inputs level and a impairment charges of million and million were recorded for the years ended january  and  related to stores being closed 
revenue recognition 
revenues from the sale of retail products are recognized at the time the customer takes possession of the product 
such revenues are recognized net of any adjustments for sales incentive offers such as discounts  coupons  rebates  or other free products or services and discounts of promotional credit sales that will extend beyond one year 
we sell repair service agreements and credit insurance contracts on behalf of unrelated third parties 
for contracts where the third parties are the obligors on the contract  commissions are recognized in revenues at the time of sale  and in the case of retrospective commissions  at the time that they are earned 
where we sell repair service renewal agreements in which we are deemed to be the obligor on the contract at the time of sale  revenue is deferred and recognized ratably  on a straight line basis  over the term of the repair service agreement 
all of these agreements typically have terms ranging from to months 
these agreements are separate units of accounting and are valued based on the agreed upon retail selling price 
the amounts of repair service agreement revenues deferred at january  and were million and million  respectively  and are included in deferred revenues and allowances in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents vendor allowances 
we receive funds from vendors for price protection  product rebates earned upon purchase or sale of product  marketing  training and promotion programs which are recorded on the accrual basis as a reduction to the related product cost 
we accrue rebates based on the satisfaction of terms of the program and sales of qualifying products even though funds may not be received until the end of a quarter or year 
if the programs are related to product purchases  the allowances  credits or payments are recorded as a reduction of product cost and if the programs are related to product sales  the allowances  credits or payments are recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold 
we received million  million and million in vendor allowances during the fiscal years ended january   and  respectively 
over the past three years we have received funds from approximately vendors  with the terms of the programs ranging between one month and one year 
accounting for leases 
we analyze each lease  at its inception and any subsequent renewal  to determine whether it should be accounted for as an operating lease or a capital lease 
additionally  monthly lease expense for each operating lease is calculated as the average of all payments required under the minimum lease term  including rent escalations 
generally  the minimum lease term begins with the date we take possession of the property and ends on the last day of the minimum lease term  and includes all rent holidays  but excludes renewal terms that are at our option 
any tenant improvement allowances received are deferred and amortized into income as a reduction of lease expense on a straight line basis over the minimum lease term 
the amortization of leasehold improvements is computed on a straight line basis over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life of the improvements 
for transactions that qualify for treatment as a sale leaseback  any gain or loss is deferred and amortized as rent expense on a straight line basis over the minimum lease term 
any deferred gain would be included in deferred gain on sale of property and any deferred loss would be included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
for locations that have ceased operation with remaining lease obligations  we record an accrual for the present value of the remaining lease obligations and anticipated ancillary occupancy costs  net of estimated sublease income 
the estimate is based on our best projection of the sublease rates we believe can be obtained for those properties and our best estimate of the marketing time it will take to find tenants to sublet those stores 
revisions to these projections of the estimated buyout terms or sublease rates are made to the obligation as further information related to the actual terms and costs becomes available 
year ended january  compared to the year ended january  executive overview this narrative is intended to provide an executive level overview of our operations for our fiscal year ended january  a detailed explanation of the changes in our operations for the period as compared to the prior year periods is included under results of operations 
the following is a summary of some of the specific items impacting our retail and credit segments retail segment review for the year ended january   total revenues decreased  primarily due to the closing of five stores during the second quarter of the year 
same store sales increased for the year  excluding the nine stores that have been closed  one store in the process of being closed and two stores with leases that expired in the current fiscal year 
the increase in same store sales was driven by increases in furniture and mattresses and home appliances 
repair service agreement commissions increased on a higher sales penetration of repair service agreements during the current year  the retail gross margin includes gross profit from both product and repair service agreement sales for the year increased to as compared to in the prior year 
the increase in the retail gross margin was driven by an increase in higher margin furniture and mattress sales as a percent of total product sales  improved product gross margins and increased sales penetration of repair service agreements 
the impact of an adjustment to the inventory reserve  which increased cost of goods sold by million  decreased retail gross margin by basis points in fiscal year an adjustment to the inventory reserve in fiscal  which increased cost of goods sold by million  decreased retail gross margin by basis points during that period  and selling  general and administrative sg a expense increased by million  and increased basis points as a percent of segment revenues to for the year ended january   compared to fiscal the total expense increase was driven by increased compensation and related expenses and contract delivery costs which were partially offset by decreased depreciation and bank fees 
we increased our investments in advertising and sales staffing  in support of our growth initiatives  to drive sales expansion during the third and fourth quarter of the current fiscal year and on an ongoing basis 

table of contents credit segment review we changed our presentation of net charge offs and the provision for bad debts to be more consistent with finance industry practice 
the impact of the change was to reflect the charges for repair service and credit insurance agreements related to credit account charge offs in net charge offs and the provision for bad debts  rather than as a reduction of revenues for the credit segment 
there was no effect on operating income or net income loss as a result of the presentation change 
total revenues for the year ended january  declined by million  as compared to the prior year  as the declining customer accounts receivable balance resulted in lower interest income and fee revenues 
as a result of the improved payment rate by our credit customers on their accounts and lower percent of sales financed under our credit programs  the average customer accounts receivable balance has fallen  from million during the year ended january   to million during the year ended january   sg a expense for the credit segment fell  or million  primarily due to reduced compensation and related expense 
continued improvement in the performance of the portfolio has allowed us to reduce the cost of servicing the portfolio 
additionally  we have reduced servicing costs  as highly re aged and delinquent accounts are being charged off more quickly as a result of changes in charge off and re age policies made during fiscal credit segment sg a expense as a percent of revenues was for the year ended january  as compared to in the prior year  while we experienced continued improvement in our credit portfolio performance specifically  the trends in the payment rate and percent of the portfolio re aged  the provision for bad debts increased by million during the year ended january   from million in the prior year 
the increase is due primarily to the impact of the adoption of new accounting guidance for tdr within the fiscal quarter ended october   which increased the fiscal provision for bad debts by million  net interest expense decreased in the year ended january  by million over the prior year primarily due to the effect of a lower overall debt balance outstanding and the prior period payoff of the higher cost securitization borrowings 
operational changes and outlook we have implemented  continued to focus on or modified operating initiatives that we believe will positively impact future results  including reviewing our existing store locations to ensure the customer demographics and retail sales opportunity are sufficient to achieve our store performance expectations  and selectively closing or relocating stores to achieve those goals  evaluating store opening plans for future years 
we have begun the planning and preparation to open five to seven new locations during fiscal year  all of which are expected to be in new markets  augmenting our credit offerings through the use of third party consumer credit providers to provide flexible financing options to meet the varying needs of our customers  while focusing the use of our credit program to offer credit to customers where third party programs are not available  limiting the number of months an account can be re aged and reducing the period of time a delinquent account can remain outstanding before it is charged off 
additionally  we are utilizing shorter contract terms for higher risk products and smaller balances originated to continue to increase the payment rate and improve credit quality 
we have increased credit lines to higher credit scored customers to allow them to purchase additional products given our furniture and mattress offerings expansion 
in total  these changes are expected to continue to improve the performance of our portfolio and increase the cost effectiveness of our collections operation  and we have closed of the underperforming retail locations that did not perform at the level we expect for mature store locations 
after the remaining store is closed  we will have a total of retail stores 
one of the stores was located in oklahoma  with of the stores located in texas  with two located in the austin market  five in the dallas market  two in the houston market and two in the san antonio market 
five of the stores closed were closed during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 

table of contents while we have benefited from our operations being concentrated in the texas  louisiana and oklahoma region in the past  recent weakness in the national and state economies  including instability in the financial markets and the volatility of oil and natural gas prices  have and will present significant challenges to our operations in the coming quarters 
our customers continue to be pressured by higher gas and food prices and high levels of unemployment and  as a result  we have seen national average selling prices for televisions decline

table of contents on july   we completed an amendment and extension of our asset based revolving credit facility  increasing the capacity from million to million and extending the maturity date from november to july on november  we obtained an increase in the total commitments under our asset based revolving credit facility  increasing the capacity from million to million with no change in maturity dates 
our asset based revolving credit facility provides funding based on a borrowing base calculation that includes customer accounts receivable and inventory 
the credit facility bears interest at libor plus a spread ranging from basis points to basis points  based on a leverage ratio defined as total liabilities to tangible net worth 
in addition to the leverage ratio  the revolving credit facility includes a fixed charge coverage requirement  a minimum customer receivables cash recovery percentage requirement and a net capital expenditures limit 
the leverage ratio covenant requirement is a required maximum of to 
the current fixed charge coverage ratio is a minimum of to 
we expect  based on current facts and circumstances that we will be in compliance with the above covenants for at least the next months 
the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under the asset based revolving credit facility at january   was 
we entered into an million real estate loan on july   collateralized by three of our owned store locations  that will mature in july and requires monthly principal payments based on a year amortization schedule 
the loan was then amended on october  to adjust the interest rate 
the interest rate on the loan is the prime rate plus basis points 
the floor on the total rate was reduced from to  effective october  during the quarter ended july   we completed the repayment of our term loan with proceeds from the new real estate loan and borrowings under our expanded revolving credit facility 
during the quarter ended october  we entered into interest rate cap option transactions with a notional amount of million 
these cap options are held for the purpose of hedging against variable interest rate risk related to the variability of cash flows in the interest payments on a portion of its variable rate debt  based on the benchmark one month libor interest rate exceeding 
these cap options have monthly caplets extending through august the weighted average effective interest rate on borrowings outstanding under all our credit facilities for the year ended january  was  including the interest expense associated with our interest rate caps and amortization of deferred financing costs

the covenants are calculated quarterly on a trailing month basis  except for the cash recovery percentage  which is calculated monthly on a trailing three month basis 
as of january   we had immediately available borrowing capacity of million under our asset based revolving credit facility  net of standby letters of credit issued  available to us for general corporate purposes 
in addition to the million currently available under the revolving credit facility  an additional million may become available if we grow the balance of eligible customer receivables and total eligible inventory balances 
the principal payments received on customer receivables averaged approximately million per month during the fiscal year ended january   and are available each month to fund new customer receivables generated 
during fiscal  we expect to grow the balance of the credit portfolio 
we will continue to finance our operations and future growth through a combination of cash flow generated from operations and external borrowings  including bank debt and securitization facilities  extended vendor terms for purchases of inventory and acquisition of inventory under consignment arrangements 
based on our current operating plans  we believe that cash generated from operations  available borrowings under our revolving credit facility  extended vendor terms for purchases of inventory and acquisition of inventory under consignment arrangements will be sufficient to fund our operations  store expansion and updating activities and capital programs for at least the next months  subject to continued compliance with the covenants in our credit facilities 
additionally  if there is a default under any of 
table of contents the facilities that is not waived by the various lenders  it could result in the requirement to immediately begin repayment of all amounts owed under our credit facilities  as all of the facilities have cross default provisions that would result in default under all of the facilities if there is a default under any one of the facilities 
if the repayment of amounts owed under our credit facilities is accelerated for any reason  we may not have sufficient cash and liquid assets at such time to be able to immediately repay all the amounts owed under the facilities 
the revolving credit facility is a significant factor relative to our ongoing liquidity and our ability to meet the cash needs associated with the growth of our business 
our inability to use this program because of a failure to comply with its covenants would adversely affect our business operations 
funding of current and future customer receivables under the borrowing facilities can be adversely affected if we exceed certain predetermined levels of re aged customer receivables  write offs  bankruptcies or other ineligible customer receivable amounts 
capital expenditures 
we lease of our stores  and our plans for future store locations include primarily leases  but do not exclude store ownership 
our capital expenditures for future new store projects should primarily be for our tenant improvements to the property leased including any new distribution centers and warehouses  the cost of which is estimated to be between million and million per store  and for our existing store remodels  in the range of  per store remodel  depending on store size 
in the event we purchase existing properties  our capital expenditures will depend on the particular property and whether it is improved when purchased 
we are continuously reviewing new relationship and funding sources and alternatives for new stores  which may include sale leaseback or direct purchase lease programs  as well as other funding sources for our purchase and construction of those projects 
if we are successful in these relationship developments  our direct cash needs should include only our capital expenditures for tenant improvements to leased properties and our remodel programs for existing stores  but could include full ownership 
in addition to remodeling existing stores  we have re initiated our store opening program with plans to open five to seven new stores during fiscal year all of these stores will be in new markets  and is expected to include our entrance into at least one new state 
our anticipated capital expenditure budget for fiscal year is million to million  net of landlord allowances 
cash flow operating activities 
during the year ended january   net operating cash flows increased to million provided by operating activities  from million provided by operating activities in the twelve months ended january  operating cash flows for the year ended january  were driven primarily by cash flows from operating activities primarily net loss plus depreciation  loss from early extinguishment of debt and costs and impairment charges related to store closings and reductions in the balance of customer accounts receivable 
investing activities 
net cash used by investing activities increased million  from the prior fiscal year due to slightly increased expenditures for property and equipment from fiscal year and the release of restricted cash balances upon the termination of the securitization program in fiscal year financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities decreased by million from million used during the year ended january   to million used during the year ended january   as we used net cash flows from operating activities to pay down total amounts under our financing facilities 
additionally  we used proceeds from our million real estate loan and draws from our expanded revolving credit facility to complete the repayment of our term loan

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates under our expanded asset based revolving credit facility are variable and bear interest at libor plus a spread ranging from basis points to basis points  based on a leverage ratio defined as total liabilities to tangible net worth 
accordingly  changes in libor will affect the interest rate on  and therefore our costs under  these credit facilities 
since january   the balance outstanding under our asset based revolving credit facility has increased from million to million at january  the notional balance of interest caps used to fix the rate on a portion of asset based revolving credit facility balance was million at january  these interest rate caps will offset any interest rate increases once the libor rate exceeds 
accordingly  a basis point increase in interest rates on the asset based revolving credit facility would increase our borrowing costs by million over a month period  based on the balance outstanding at january   after considering the impact of the interest rate caps 
we entered into an million real estate loan on july   collateralized by three of our owned store locations  that will mature in july and requires monthly principal payments based on a year amortization schedule 
the loan was then amended on october   to adjust the interest rate 
the floor on the total rate was reduced from to effective october  the interest rate on the loan is the prime rate plus basis points  with a floor on the total rate of 
because prime is more than basis points below the minimum rate under the real estate loan  a basis point change in the prime rate would not impact the current anticipated interest expense under that loan 
interest rate risk management we did not enter into any risk management trading activities during the year ended january  our market risk sensitive instruments and positions have been determined to be other than trading 
our risk management activities primarily attempt to mitigate price risks related to fluctuations in interest payments on libor based floating rate debt instruments through the use of financial derivative instruments 
our risk management strategy involves capping floating interest rates through the use of a series of purchased swaps and or purchased put option caps 
these caps seek to mitigate the impact of upward floating interest rates on future cash flows when the libor rate exceeds 
these financial derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges 
our risk management activities include the use of financial derivative instruments including  but not limited to  price swaps and options to seek protection from adverse price movements and to minimize potential increases to interest expenses 
we enter into these financial derivative instruments directly with third parties in the over the counter market 

table of contents market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates are monitored by senior management 
we have prepared a sensitivity analysis to estimate the exposure to market risk related to floating rate debt 
any swaps and options outstanding as of january  and that were used in our risk management activities were analyzed using a hypothetical basis point adverse change in libor rates for all forward months within the terms of the risk management derivatives 
there was no potential loss in future earnings from these positions due to a basis point adverse movement in libor interest rates as of january  the transactions being hedged are subject to increased interest payments on increasing interest rates up to the hedging cap rate of a libor rate of 
the preceding hypothetical analysis is limited because changes in prices may or may not equal basis points  thus actual results may differ 
our sensitivity analysis includes designated hedging and the anticipated transactions associated with these hedging transactions 
these hedging transactions are anticipated to be very close to effective once the hedged cap level is reached  therefore  there is essentially no effect on our sensitivity analysis from these hedging positions 
to the extent option contracts are used as hedging instruments for anticipated transactions we have included the offsetting effect of the anticipated transactions  only to the extent the option contracts are in the money  or would become in the money as a result of the basis point hypothetical movements in prices 
credit risk we maintain credit policies with regard to our counterparties for financial hedging derivative instruments that we believe significantly minimize overall credit risk 
these policies include an evaluation of counterparties financial condition including credit ratings  and entering into agreements with counterparties that govern credit guidelines 
these counterparties consist of major financial institutions 
the overall impact due to certain changes in economic  regulatory and other events may impact our overall exposure to credit risk  either positively or negatively in that counterparties may similarly be impacted 
based on our policies  exposures  credit and other reserves  management does not anticipate a material adverse effect on financial position or results of operations as a result of counterparty performance
