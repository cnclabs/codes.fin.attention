item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes  included elsewhere in part ii of this annual report 
this discussion also should be read in conjunction with the information in item ia of part i of this report  entitled risk factors  which contains information about certain risks and uncertainties that can affect our business and our financial performance in the future 
introduction and overview our business collectors universe  inc we  us management our or the company provides authentication and grading services to dealers and collectors of high value coins  trading cards  event tickets  autographs  sports and historical memorabilia 
we believe that our authentication and grading services add value to these collectibles by providing dealers and collectors with a high level of assurance as to the authenticity and quality of the collectibles they seek to buy or sell  thereby enhancing their marketability and providing increased liquidity to the dealers  collectors and consumers that own  buy and sell such collectibles 
we principally generate revenues from the fees paid for our authentication and grading services 
to a much lesser extent  we generate revenues from other related services which consist of i the sale of advertising and commissions earned on our websites  including coinflation 
com  which we acquired in september  ii the sale of printed publications and collectibles price guides and advertising in our publications  iii the sale of membership subscriptions in our collectors club  which is designed primarily to attract interest in high value collectibles among new collectors  iv the sale of subscriptions to our cce dealer to dealer internet bid ask market for certified coins and to our coinfacts website  which offers a comprehensive one stop source for historical us numismatic information and value added content  and v the management and operation of collectibles trade shows and conventions 
our revenues through june include revenues for our former stamp authentication and grading business  which we sold in june we also generate revenues from sales of our collectibles inventory  which is primarily comprised of collectible coins that we have purchased under our coin grading warranty program  however  such product sales are neither the focus nor an integral part of our on going revenue generating activities 
factors that can affect operating results and our financial position factors that can affect our revenue 
our authentication and grading fees accounted for approximately of our total net revenues in the year ended june  the amounts of those fees are primarily driven by the volume and mix of coin and collectibles sales and purchase transactions by collectibles dealers and collectors  because our collectibles authentication and grading services generally facilitate sales and purchases of coins and other high value collectibles by providing dealers and collectors with a high level of assurance as to the authenticity and quality of the collectibles they seek to sell or buy 
consequently  dealers and collectors most often submit coins and other collectibles to us for authentication and grading at those times when they are in the market to sell or buy coins and other high value collectibles 
in addition  our coin authentication and grading revenues are impacted by the number of modern coin submissions and the related average service fee earned on those submissions  both of which can be volatile and depend on the timing and size of modern coin marketing programs by the united states mint and by customers or dealers who specialize in sales of such coins 
the amounts of our authentication and grading revenues are affected by i the volume and mix of authentication and grading submissions among coins and trading cards  on the one hand  and other collectibles on the other hand  ii in the case of coins and trading cards  the turnaround times requested by our customers  because we charge higher fees for faster service times  and iii the mix of authentication and grading submissions between vintage or classic coins and trading cards  on the one hand  and modern coins and trading cards  on the other hand  because dealers generally request faster turnaround times for vintage or classic coins and trading cards than they do for modern submissions  as vintage or classic collectibles are of significantly higher value and are more saleable by dealers than modern coins and trading cards  and iv as discussed above  the timing of marketing programs for modern coins 
our revenues are also affected by the volume of coin authentication and grading submissions we receive at collectibles trade shows where we provide on site authentication and grading services to show attendees  because they typically request higher priced same day turnaround for the coins they submit to us for authentication and grading at those shows 
the level of trade show submissions varies from period to period depending upon a number of factors  including the number and the timing of the shows in each period and the volume of collectible coins that are bought and sold at those shows by dealers and collectors 
in addition  the number of such submissions and  therefore  the revenues and gross profit margin we generate from the authentication and grading of coins at trade shows can be impacted by short term changes in the prices of gold that sometimes occur around the time of the shows  because gold prices can affect the willingness of dealers and collectors to sell and purchase coins at the shows 
five of our coin authentication and grading customers accounted  in the aggregate  for approximately of our total net revenues in the year ended june  as a result  the loss of any of those customers  or a significant decrease in the volume of grading submissions from any of them to us  could cause our net revenues to decline and  therefore  could adversely affect our results of operations 
the following table provides information regarding the respective numbers of coins  trading cards  autographs and stamps that we authenticated or graded in the fiscal years ended june    and units processed coins trading cards autographs stamps total the following table sets forth the estimated values at which our customers insured the coins  trading cards  autographs and stamps that they submitted to us for grading or authentication declared values s coins trading cards autographs stamps total we sold our stamp authentication and grading business in june factors affecting our gross profit margins 
the gross profit margins we earn on collectibles authentication and grading submissions are impacted by many of the same factors that impact our revenues  as the average service fee and the resulting gross profit margin earned is affected by i the volume and mix of those submissions among coins  trading cards and other collectibles  because we generally realize higher margins on coin submissions than on submissions of other collectibles  ii in the case of coins and trading cards  the turnaround times requested by our customers  because we charge higher fees for faster service times  and iii the mix of authentication and grading submissions between vintage or classic coins and trading cards  on the one hand  and modern coins and trading cards  on the other hand  because dealers generally request faster turnaround times for vintage or classic coins and trading cards than they do for modern submissions 
in addition  because a significant proportion of our costs of sales are fixed in nature in the short term  our gross profit margin is also affected by the overall volume of collectibles that we authenticate and grade in any period 
furthermore  the level of other related services in any period can impact the overall gross profit margin 
impact of economic conditions on our financial performance 
as discussed above  our operating results are affected by the volume of collectibles transactions by collectibles dealers and collectors which  in turn  is primarily affected by i the cash flows generated by collectibles dealers and their confidence about future economic conditions  which affect their willingness and the ability of such dealers to purchase collectibles for resale  ii the availability and cost of borrowings because collectibles dealers often rely on borrowings to fund their purchases of collectibles  iii the disposable income available to collectors and their confidence about future economic conditions  because high value collectibles are generally viewed as luxury goods and are purchased with disposable income  iv prevailing and anticipated rates of inflation and the strength or weakness of the us dollar  and more recently worries about sovereign debt obligations and credit ratings in the united states and europe  because conditions of this nature often lead investors and consumers to purchase or invest in gold and silver coins as a hedge against inflation or reductions in the purchasing power of the us currency  and as an alternative to investments in government bonds and other treasury instruments  and v the performance and volatility of the gold and other precious metals markets  which can affect the level of purchases and sales of collectible coins  because investors and consumers will often increase their purchases of gold coins  as well as other hard assets if they believe that the market prices of those assets will increase 
as a result  the volume of collectibles transactions and  therefore  the demand for our authentication and grading services  generally increase during periods characterized by increases in disposable income and the availability of lower cost borrowings  on the one hand  or increases in inflation or in gold prices  economic uncertainties and declines in business and consumer confidence or a weakening of the us dollar on the other hand 
by contrast  collectibles transactions and  therefore  the demand for our services generally declines during periods characterized by economic downturns or recessions  declines in consumer and business confidence  an absence of inflationary pressure  or periods of stagnation or decline in the market prices of gold 
however  these conditions can sometimes counteract each other as it is not uncommon  for example  for investors to shift funds from gold to other investments during periods of economic growth and growing consumer and business confidence and from stocks and other investments to gold during periods of economic uncertainties and decreases in disposable income and consumer and business confidence 
factors that can affect our liquidity and financial position 
a substantial number of our authentication and grading customers prepay our authentication and grading fees when they submit their collectibles to us for authentication and grading 
as a result  historically  we have been able to rely on internally generated cash and have never incurred borrowings to fund our continuing operations 
we currently expect that internally generated cash flows and current cash and cash equivalent balances will be sufficient to fund our continuing operations at least through the end of fiscal in addition to the day to day operating performance of our business  our overall financial position can also be affected by the company s capital raising or stock buyback activities  the dividend policy adopted by the board of directors from time to time  and the company s decisions to invest in and to fund acquisitions of established and or early stage businesses 
in july  the company used approximately million of available cash to purchase  shares of our common stock in a dutch auction tender offer 
we paid approximately million  million and million in cash dividends to stockholders in fiscal   and  respectively 
in addition  our liquidity and financial position are impacted by the company s tax position because we have had net operating losses and other tax attributes available to offset or reduce taxes payable 
through june   we had fully utilized all of our federal net operating losses and other tax attributes and have begun making estimated tax payments for federal income tax purposes at an estimated tax rate of 
trends and challenges in and opportunities for our businesses in response to the economic recession and the credit crisis that adversely impacted the volume of authentication and grading submissions to us during fiscal  we implemented a cost reduction program to reduce our costs of revenue and our operating expenses to bring those costs and expenses more in line with our revenues and  thereby  increase our gross profits and operating income 
that program  combined with the increase in our coin authentication and grading revenues  resulted in operating income before a non cash impairment loss in increasing from million in  to million in and million in in  despite a increase in revenues  operating income declined to million  primarily as a result of a decline in revenues from modern coins in the fourth quarter of fiscal through the six months ended december   our modern coin grading fees were up  compared to the comparable period of the prior year  whereas  for the year ended june   those fees increased by only 
in the third quarter of fiscal  our modern coin grading fees were substantially unchanged  compared to the third quarter of fiscal  and in the fourth quarter of  our modern coin grading fees declined by approximately million  or  compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal our modern coin fees can be volatile depending on the timing and size of marketing programs by the united states mint and by customers and dealers who specialize in sales of such coins

critical accounting policies and estimates general 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  we record our assets at the lower of cost or fair value 
in determining the fair value of certain of our assets  principally accounts and notes receivable inventories  goodwill and intangible assets  we must make judgments  estimates and assumptions regarding circumstances or trends that could affect the value of those assets  such as economic conditions or trends that could impact  eg  our ability to fully collect our accounts receivable or realize the value of our inventories in future periods 
those judgments  estimates  and assumptions are based on current information available to us at that time 
many of these conditions  trends and circumstances on which our judgments or estimates are based  however  are outside of our control and  if changes were to occur in the events  trends or other circumstances on which our judgments or estimates were based  or other unanticipated events were to happen that might affect our operations  we may be required under gaap to adjust our earlier estimates 
changes in such estimates may require that we reduce the carrying values of the affected assets on our balance sheet which are commonly referred to as write downs of the assets involved 
it is our practice to establish reserves  allowances  charges or losses to record such downward adjustments or write downs in the carrying value of assets  such as  for example  accounts and notes receivable and inventory 
such write downs are recorded as charges to income or increases in expense in our statement of operations in the periods when those reserves  allowances  charges or losses are established or increased to take account of changed conditions or events 
as a result  our judgments  estimates and assumptions about future events and changes in the conditions  events or trends upon which those estimates and judgments were made  can and will affect not only the amounts at which we record such assets on our balance sheet  but also our results of operations 
the decisions as to the timing of adjustments or write downs of this nature also require subjective evaluations or assessments about the effects and duration of events or changes in circumstances 
for example  it is difficult to predict whether events or conditions  such as increases in interest rates or economic slowdowns  will have short or longer term consequences for our business  and it is not uncommon for it to take some time after the occurrence of an event or the onset of changes in economic circumstances for their full effects to be recognized 
therefore  management makes such estimates based upon the information available at that time and reevaluates and adjusts its reserves  allowances  charges or losses for potential write downs on a quarterly basis 
we have acquired certain businesses and assets some of which are now classified as part of discontinued operations  as we have closed  or disposed of such assets  and in accordance with gaap  we accounted for those acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
that accounting method required us to allocate amounts paid for those businesses in excess of the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed  and to classify that excess as goodwill 
in accordance with gaap  we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if we believe that goodwill has been impaired in the interim due to changing facts or events see goodwill below 
other intangible assets that are separable from goodwill and have definite lives are subject to amortization over their remaining useful lives see long lived assets other than goodwill below 
indefinite lived intangible assets are subject to ongoing evaluation for impairment 
management formally evaluates the carrying value of its goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on the anniversary date of each of the business acquisitions that gave rise to the recording of such assets 
if it is determined  from any such impairment analysis  that the estimated fair value of any such assets has declined below their carrying values  it would become necessary for us to recognize an impairment charge that would have the effect of reducing our income in the period when that charge is recognized 
we also estimate losses associated with the disposal of a business or the sale of assets when a decision has been made to dispose of or discontinue such business or sell such assets 
in accordance with gaap  assets available for sale are stated at the lower of cost or their net realizable value 
in addition  the estimated fair value of liabilities for employee terminations is recognized as of the date such terminations are communicated to the affected employees and for lease obligations as of the date we cease using the real property or equipment subject to the lease 
in making our estimates and assumptions  we follow gaap in order to enable us to make fair and consistent estimates of the fair value of assets and to establish adequate reserves  allowances  charges or losses for possible write downs in the carrying values of our assets 
set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies and critical estimates that we believe are material to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition policies 
we generally record revenue at the time of shipment of the authenticated and graded collectible to the customer  net of any taxes collected 
due to the insignificant delay between the completion of our grading and authentication services and the shipment of the collectible or high value asset back to the customer  the time of shipment corresponds to the completion of our services 
many of our authentication and grading customers prepay our authentication and grading fees when they submit their collectibles to us for authentication and grading 
we record those prepayments as deferred revenue until the collectibles have been authenticated and graded and shipped back to them 
at that time  we record the revenues from the authentication and grading services we have performed for the customer and deduct this amount from deferred revenue 
for certain dealers to whom we extend open account privileges  we record revenue at the time of shipment of the authenticated and graded collectible to the dealer 
a portion of our net revenues is comprised of subscription fees paid by customers for memberships in our collectors club 
those memberships entitle members access to our on line and printed publications and  in some cases  include vouchers for free grading services 
through the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded revenue for this multi element service arrangement by recognizing approximately of the subscription fee in the month following the membership purchase 
the balance of the membership fee was recognized as revenue over the life of the membership  which can range from one to two years 
we evaluated  at least semi annually  the relative fair values of the deliverables and the percentage factors used to allocate the membership fees between the grading services and the other services provided to members 
in the third quarter of fiscal  arising from the upgrading of the company s accounting systems  which enables us to track separately the issuance and redemption of individual free grading vouchers  the company began recognizing revenue attributable to free grading vouchers on a specific basis and to classify such revenues as part of grading and authentication fees rather than other related service revenues 
the balance of the membership fee continues to be recognized over the life of the membership 
this refinement of the company s revenue recognition policy resulted in approximately  of revenues being deferred that we otherwise would have recognized in the six months ended at june  in the case of our expos trade show business  we recognize revenue generated by the promotion  management and operation of each of its collectibles conventions or trade shows in the fiscal period in which the convention or show takes place 
for pcgs s coinfacts and certified coin exchange subscription revenues  we recognize revenue ratably over the relevant subscription period 
we recognize the revenue from the sale of products when it is shipped to the customer and all the requirements for revenue recognition have been satisfied 
such products consist primarily of collectible coins that we purchase pursuant to our coin authentication and grading warranty program and those product sales are not considered an integral part of our ongoing revenue generating activities 
accrual for losses on facility leases 
as a result of the discontinuance of and our exit from the jewelry authentication and grading businesses in fiscal  we ceased the occupancy of facilities we had leased for their operations 
we retained a commercial real estate broker to sublease those facilities on our behalf and established estimated loss accruals of  for liabilities under those leases 
in may  we entered into agreements to reduce those lease obligations  whereby one of the spaces was sublet to a third party  and the second facility was returned to the landlord and the lease terminated with only a financial obligation remaining 
as a result of these agreements  and in accordance with gaap  the company measured the change in cash flows using the same credit adjusted risk free rate that was used to measure the initial liabilities and the cumulative effect of the change of approximately  resulting from the revision  was recognized as a reduction to the liability 
as a result of those changes  our ongoing payments of the obligations and the recognition of accretion expense  the remaining obligations were approximately  at june  we will continue to review and  if necessary  make adjustments to these accruals on a quarterly basis 
accounts receivable  notes receivable and the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in the normal course of our authentication and grading business  we extend payment terms to many of the larger  more creditworthy dealers who submit collectibles to us for authentication and grading on an ongoing basis 
we regularly review our accounts receivable  estimate the amounts of  and establish an allowance for  uncollectible accounts in each quarterly period 
the amount of that allowance is based on several factors  including the age and extent of significant past due accounts and known conditions or trends that may affect the ability of account debtors to pay their accounts receivable balances 
each quarter we review our estimates of uncollectible amounts and  if necessary  adjust the allowance to take account of changes in economic or other conditions or trends that we believe will have an adverse effect on the ability of any of the account debtors to pay their accounts in full 
since the allowance is increased by recording a charge against income that is reflected in general and administrative expenses  an increase in the allowance will cause an increase in such expenses 
at june  and  the allowances for doubtful accounts were  and  respectively 
inventory valuation reserves 
our collectibles inventories  which consist primarily of collectible coins that we have purchased pursuant to our coin warranty program and other consumable inventory related to our authentication and grading activities  are valued at the lower of cost or fair value and have been reduced by an inventory valuation allowance to provide for potential declines in the value of those inventories below their carrying values 
the amount of the allowance is determined and is periodically adjusted on the basis of market knowledge  historical experience and estimates concerning future economic conditions or trends that may impact the sales value of the collectibles inventories 
additionally  due to the relative uniqueness and special features of some of the coin collectibles included in our collectibles inventory and the volatility in the prices of precious metals  valuation of such collectibles often involves judgments that are more subjective than those that are required when determining the market values of more standardized products 
as a result  we review the market values of the collectibles in our inventory on a quarterly basis and make adjustments to the valuation reserve that we believe are necessary or prudent based on our judgments regarding these matters 
in the event that a collectible is sold for a price below its carrying value  we record a charge to operating income 
at june  and  collectibles inventories were  and  and inventory reserves were  and  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
if we liquidate collectible coins at amounts below their carrying value  we may incur losses in excess of our recorded inventory reserves 
grading warranty costs 
we offer a limited warranty covering the coins and trading cards that we authenticate and grade 
under the warranty  if such a collectible that was previously authenticated and graded by us is later submitted to us for re grading and either i receives a lower grade upon re submittal or ii is determined not to have been authentic  we will offer to purchase the collectible for a price equal to the value of collectible at its original grade  or  at the customer s option  pay the difference between the value of the collectible at its original grade as compared with the value at its lower grade 
however  this warranty is voided if the collectible  upon re submittal to us  is not in the same tamper resistant holder in which it was placed at the time we last graded the item or if we otherwise determine that the collectible had been altered after we had authenticated and graded it 
if we purchase an item under a warranty claim  we recognize the difference in the value of the item at its original grade and its re graded estimated value as a reduction in our warranty reserve 
we include the purchased item in our inventory at the estimated re graded value of the collectible  which will be lower than the price we paid to purchase the item 
we accrue for estimated warranty costs based on historical trends and related experience  and we monitor the adequacy of our warranty reserve on an ongoing basis 
there also are a number of factors that can cause the estimated values of the collectibles purchased under our warranty program to change over time and  as a result  we review the market values of those collectibles on a quarterly basis see inventory valuation reserves above 
however  once we have classified such items as inventory and they have been held in inventory beyond the end of the fiscal quarter in which we purchased them  we classify any gains or losses on the subsequent disposal of such items as part of the gain or loss on product sales and not as an adjustment to our warranty reserves 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for activity in our warranty reserves 
goodwill 
we test the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually on their respective acquisition anniversary dates  or more frequently if indicators of impairment are determined to exist 
when testing for impairment  we consider qualitative factors  and where determined necessary by management  we proceed to the two step goodwill impairment test 
when applying the two step impairment test  we apply a discounted cash flow model or an income approach to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit on a total basis  which is then compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit  no impairment of goodwill exists as of the measurement date 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  then there is the possibility of goodwill impairment and further testing and re measurement of goodwill is required 
during the first quarter ended september   we completed the annual goodwill impairment evaluations with respect to the goodwill acquired in our fiscal year purchases of cce and coinfacts 
we assessed qualitative factors  including the significant excess of fair value over carrying value in prior years  and any material changes in the estimated cash flows of those reporting units and determined that it was more likely than not that the respective fair values of cce and coinfacts exceeded their respective carrying values  including goodwill  and therefore it was not necessary to proceed to the two step impairment test 
as discussed in previous filings  the company recognized impairment losses of  in fiscal related to expos  including goodwill of  and intangible assets of  see long lived assets other than goodwill 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment evaluation with respect to expos at june  and concluded that no further impairment had occurred 
long lived assets other than goodwill 
we regularly conduct reviews of property and equipment and other long lived assets other than goodwill  including certain identifiable intangibles  for possible impairment 
such reviews occur annually  or more frequently  if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable in full 
in order to determine if the value of a definite lived asset is impaired  we make an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of that asset and its eventual disposition in order to determine if an impairment loss has occurred 
if the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recorded to write down the asset to its estimated fair value 
based on such reviews at june   we determined that impairment losses had occurred with respect to certain long lived assets of our expos business  and we therefore recognized impairment losses of  for intangible assets in fiscal  comprising a loss of  for the expos tradename and  for the customer database 
see goodwill above 
as a result of the impairment of the expos tradename recorded at june  and management s expectations as to the period over which the tradename will contribute to and generate future cash flows of the company  the tradename was determined to have a finite life 
effective july   the tradename is being amortized over a period of years 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense is measured at the grant date of an award  based on its estimated fair value  and is recognized as expense over the employee or non employee director s requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period of the award 
however  if the vesting of a stock based compensation award is subject to satisfaction of a performance requirement or condition  the stock based compensation expense is recognized if  and when  management determines that the achievement of the performance requirement or condition and therefore the vesting of the award has become probable 
in the event that stock based compensation is recognized on the basis that the performance condition is probable  and management subsequently determines that the performance condition is not met  then all expense previously recognized with respect to the performance condition would be reversed 
we recognize stock based compensation expense for service based stock option awards using the black scholes option valuation method 
under that method  we make assumptions with respect to the expected lives of the options or other stock awards that have been granted and are outstanding  the expected volatility and the dividend yield percentage of our common stock and the risk free interest rate at the respective dates of grant 
in addition  we recognize and report stock based compensation expense  net of a forfeitures with respect to outstanding awards that we expect will occur over their respective vesting periods  which we estimate on the basis of historical forfeiture experience or other factors that could affect the likelihood of forfeiture 
we monitor the rate of forfeitures closely to ensure that all stock awards that vest are fully expensed over their respective vesting periods using the straight line attribution method 
no options were granted in fiscal years through  and all options previously granted had become fully vested as of june  service based stock awards that are granted to members of our board of directors on an annual basis and to certain members of senior management are recognized as stock based compensation over the requisite service period 
restricted shares annual director grants 
we grant restricted stock awards to each outside director with a grant date value of  per director on an annual basis with respect for which the only condition for vesting is continued service during the specified vesting periods 
fiscal and management restricted stock awards 
in august and  the compensation committee of the board of directors definitively determined that the company had achieved the financial performance goal for fiscals and  respectively 
as a result  stock based compensation on the remaining unvested shares granted for those respective years is being recognized over the remaining service period  dependent on the continued service of the participant 
fiscal management restricted stock awards 
on july   the compensation committee awarded  restricted shares to executive officers and senior management participant  pursuant to the company s stockholder approved equity incentive plan the plan 
those restricted shares are subject to certain risks of forfeiture  which are summarized below 
service contingent shares 
the vesting of of the restricted shares is contingent on the participants remaining in continuous service of the company the service based shares and will vest in sixteen equal quarterly installments through june  with the exception of the company s chief executive officer  whose service contingent shares vest over eight quarters through june  performance contingent shares 
the remaining of the restricted shares the performance based shares are subject to forfeiture in their entirety if the company does not achieve a minimum financial performance goal  measured on the basis of the company s fiscal operating income 
depending on the financial performance achieved  a number of shares will be determined  and those shares will vest as follows i one third of the shares will become vested if the participant is still in the company s service on june   ii another one third of the shares will become vested on june  if the participant is still in the company s service as of that date  and iii the final one third will vest on june  if the participant is still in the company s service on such date 
participants may also earn a maximum additional more shares if the company exceeds the fiscal financial performance goal by at least management estimated the fair value of the  shares of restricted stock to be  based on the closing price per share of the company s common stock of on the grant date  of which  relates to the service based awards and  relates to the performance based awards 
for service based awards  we record stock based compensation expense over the requisite service periods that commenced on july  and that will continue through june  in december  the company began recognizing stock based compensation for the performance contingent shares on the basis that it was probable that the company would meet of the financial performance goal for fiscal in august  it was determined by the compensation committee of the board of directors  that the company had achieved approximately of the financial performance goal for  and  as a result  approximately of the performance contingent shares qualified for vesting at that time  and approximately  of expense recognized in the nine months ended march  was reversed in the fourth quarter of the company recognized total stock based compensation related to options and restricted shares of   and  for fiscal years ended june    and  respectively 
capitalized software 
in fiscal years  and  we capitalized approximately   and  respectively  of software development costs related to a number of in house software development projects 
gaap requires that certain software development costs incurred  either from internal or external sources  be capitalized as part of intangible assets and amortized on a straight line basis over the useful life of the software  which we have estimated at three years 
on the other hand  planning  training  support and maintenance costs incurred either prior to or following the implementation phase of a software development project are recognized as expense in the periods in which they are incurred 
during the fiscal years ended june   and  we recorded approximately   and  respectively  as amortization expense related to such capitalized software projects 
we evaluate the carrying values of capitalized software to determine whether those values are impaired and  if necessary  we record an impairment charge in the period in which we determine that an impairment has occurred 
income taxes  deferred tax assets and valuation allowances 
we account for income taxes in accordance with gaap  which requires the recording of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns or uncertain tax positions 
measurement of the deferred items is based on enacted tax laws 
in the event the future consequences of differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of the company s assets or liabilities result in a deferred tax asset  gaap requires that we evaluate the probability of realizing the future income tax benefits comprising that asset based on a number of factors  which include projections of future taxable income and the nature of the tax benefits and the respective expiration dates of tax credits and net operating losses 
the lower tax provision in fiscal reflects a benefit for the excess tax basis over the book basis of the company s investment in a subsidiary of approximately million and a lower effective tax rate resulting from a change in the company s state apportionment factors  both recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal in fiscal  the company recognized income tax provisions of million based on an estimated annual effective tax rate of 
in earlier years  we had established valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets 
at june   we concluded that it had become more likely than not  that we would be able to realize all of our remaining deferred tax assets 
as a result  the valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets were released at june  of this tax benefit of approximately million  approximately million was utilized to offset current fiscal taxable income  and the balance of million was recognized as an income tax benefit in the statement of operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data  expressed as a percentage of net revenues  derived from our consolidated statements of operations for the respective periods indicated below fiscal year ended june  net revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses selling and marketing expenses general administrative expenses impairment losses total operating expenses operating income interest and other income  net income before provision benefit for income taxes provision benefit for income taxes income from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations  net of loss on sales of discontinued businesses net of income taxes net income net revenues 
net revenues consist primarily of fees that we generate from the authentication and grading of high value collectibles  including coins  trading cards and autographs 
through june  we were also engaged in the authentication and grading of stamps 
to a lesser extent  we generate collectibles related service revenues which we refer to as other related revenues from advertising and commissions earned on our websites including coinflation 
com  which we acquired in september and in printed publications and collectibles price guides  subscription membership revenues related to our cce dealer to dealer internet bid ask market for certified coins  coinfacts and collectors club  and fees earned from promoting  managing and operating collectibles conventions 
net revenues also include  to a significantly lesser extent  revenues from the sales of products  which consist primarily of coins that we purchase under our warranty policy 
we do not consider such product sales to be an integral part of our ongoing revenue generating activities

the increase in our authentication and grading fees  compared to a increase in the number of units authenticated and graded in fiscal  relates to an increase in the average service fee earned on coins  primarily driven by increases in the average service fees earned for the authentication and grading of modern and world coins  due to the mix of services provided and due to pricing initiatives on certain of our modern coin programs

this general market decline is impacting our customers who submit modern coins to us 
therefore  it is uncertain what level of growth  if any  we can expect or if we may experience a decline in coin revenues in fiscal  compared to fiscal as discussed under factors that can affect our operating results and financial position  the level of modern coin and trade show revenues can be volatile  as evidenced by the fact that modern coin revenues decreased by million in the fourth quarter of fiscal  compared to the same quarter of fiscal  and therefore it is uncertain what level of growth in those revenues  if any  will be achieved in future quarters 
in addition  the increase in our authentication and grading fees earned  also reflects increased submissions of world coins from overseas  particularly asia  and authentication and grading at our paris  france and hong kong facilities  and it is uncertain whether the increased fees earned from the authentication and grading of world coins can continue at the levels achieved in fiscal or whether we can expect continued future growth 
however  management plans to continue to focus attention on world coins as a growth opportunity for us

quarterly results of operations and seasonality the following tables present unaudited selected quarterly financial data for each of the eight quarters beginning september  and ending on june  the information has been derived from our unaudited quarterly financial statements  which have been prepared by us on a basis consistent with our audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k 
the consolidated financial information set forth below includes all adjustments consisting of normal adjustments and accruals that management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the unaudited quarterly results when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
these quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for any subsequent fiscal periods 
generally  the revenues generated by our collectibles grading and authentication businesses are lower during our second quarter  which ends on december  than in other quarterly periods  because collectibles commerce generally decreases during the holiday season 
as discussed under net revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal  net revenues were lower than the comparable period of fiscal  due to a million decline in the revenues earned from the authentication and grading of modern coins 
our collectibles trade show business adds to the variability in our quarter to quarter operating results  as its revenues vary based on the timing of the collectibles trade shows it conducts 
generally  the revenues of this business are higher in the first  third and fourth quarters of our fiscal years  compared to the second quarter  because the long beach  california collectibles shows the larger of the two trade shows that it conducts take place during the first  third and fourth quarters

cash flows of discontinued operations 
discontinued operations used cash of   and  in the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
in to cash used in discontinued operations related primarily to the payment of ongoing obligations for the new york lease commitments 
in june  we subleased one of the spaces to a third party and returned the second space to the landlord with only a financial obligation remaining  which reduced the payments in fiscal and in addition  there was a severance payment in fiscal cash from or used in investing activities 
investing activities used cash of  during fiscal in fiscal  the company paid  for capital expenditures and capitalized software costs for upgrading our software systems and infrastructure equipment  including capital expenditure related to the company s expansion into asia and  for the purchase of the assets of coinflation

outstanding financial obligations continuing operations 
in december  we extended the term of our operating lease for our corporate headquarters to march at june   we did not have any other material financial obligations in connection with our continuing operations 
at june   future minimum lease payments set forth in thousands under those agreements associated with our continuing operations  are as follows year ending june  gross payment sublease income net thereafter discontinued operations at june   our remaining financial obligations for two leased facilities in new york city  that had been occupied by our discontinued jewelry authentication and grading businesses  which will expire in december  and  consist of future minimum payments associated with our discontinued operations  including both the subleased space and the space that was returned to the landlord at june   are as follows in thousands year ending june  gross payment sublease income net thereafter less discounted estimated fair value of minimum lease payments accretion expense to be recognized in future years the cash payment obligations under these two leases are to be paid on a monthly basis in accordance with the above schedule 
we will continue to re evaluate these estimates and update this loss accrual  as necessary  to take account of any changes that might occur in those remaining obligations 
see critical accounting policies and estimates accrual for losses on facility leases above 
with the exception of these lease obligations for continuing and discontinued operations  we do not have any material financial obligations  such as long term debt or capital lease or purchase obligations 
dividends

in addition  because we expect that our continuing operations will generate positive cash flow in the future  we plan to consider other uses for our available cash that we believe will enhance stockholder value  which could include additional buybacks of shares 
although we have no current plans to do so  we also may seek borrowings and we may issue additional shares of our stock to finance the growth of our collectibles businesses 
however  due to the continued slow recovery and the tight credit policy by banks in the united states  there is no assurance that we would be able to obtain such borrowings or generate additional capital on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
recent accounting pronouncements in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb  as result of a joint project with the international accounting standards board to improve the quality of and comparability of financial information for users  published a proposal that would change the accounting and financial reporting for both lessee and lessor as described under current guidance 
the proposal would effectively eliminate off balance sheet accounting for most of the operating leases of lessees and would apply one of two methods to lease accounting for lessors  depending on whether the lessor retains exposure to significant risks or benefits of the underlying assets 
the date of issuance of the final standards by the fasb and the effective date are to be determined 
management believes that the final standards  if issued in substantially the same form as the published proposal  would have a material effect on the presentation of its consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued an accounting standards update which modifies the way in which a company may conduct the annual goodwill impairment test of a reporting unit 
under the revised accounting standard  management of a reporting unit has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances exist that imply it is more likely than not an impairment of goodwill has occurred 
if  after performing this qualitative assessment  management determines that it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment has not occurred  then performing the two step impairment test is not necessary 
under the amendments in this accounting update  management of a reporting unit may also elect to proceed directly to the two step goodwill impairment test and  if such election is made  may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 
the company early adopted this guidance on september  the adoption of this pronoun cement did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial market prices  including interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk and other relevant market rate or price risks 
due to the cash and cash equivalent balances that we maintain  we are exposed to risk of changes in short term interest rates 
at june   we had approximately  in cash and cash equivalents  primarily invested in money market accounts 
reductions in short term interest rates could result in reductions in the amount of income we are able to generate on available cash 
however  any adverse impact on our operating results of reductions in interest rates is not expected to be material 
we do not engage in any activities that would expose us to significant foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risks  as our foreign activities and the cash balances we maintain overseas for our paris  france and hong kong offices are not material
