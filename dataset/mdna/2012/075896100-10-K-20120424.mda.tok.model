critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires the company to establish accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that it believes to be relevant under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
in particular  judgment is used in areas such as inventory valuation  impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  accruals for self insurance  litigation  store opening  expansion  relocation and closing costs  stock based compensation and income and certain other taxes 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
inventory valuation merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
inventory costs for bbb  buybuy baby and harmon are calculated using the weighted average retail inventory method and inventory costs for cts are calculated using the first in first out cost method 
under the retail inventory method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost to retail ratio to the retail values of inventories 
the cost associated with determining the cost to retail ratio includes merchandise purchases  net of returns to vendors  discounts and volume and incentive rebates  inbound freight expenses  duty  insurance and commissions 

table of contents at any one time  inventories include items that have been written down to the company s best estimate of their realizable value 
judgment is required in estimating realizable value and factors considered are the age of merchandise and anticipated demand 
actual realizable value could differ materially from this estimate based upon future customer demand or economic conditions 
the company estimates its reserve for shrinkage throughout the year based on historical shrinkage and any current trends  if applicable 
actual shrinkage is recorded at year end based upon the results of the company s physical inventory counts for locations at which counts were conducted 
for locations where physical inventory counts were not conducted in the fiscal year  an estimated shrink reserve is recorded based on historical shrinkage and any current trends  if applicable 
historically  the company s shrinkage has not been volatile 
the company accrues for merchandise in transit once it takes legal ownership and title to the merchandise  as such  an estimate for merchandise in transit is included in the company s merchandise inventories 
impairment of long lived assets the company reviews long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may exceed their current fair values 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
the assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 
the company has not historically recorded any material impairment to its long lived assets 
in the future  if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that a long lived asset is impaired  the company will adjust the carrying value of these long lived assets in the period in which the impairment occurs 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets the company reviews goodwill and other intangibles that have indefinite lives for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values 
impairment testing is based upon the best information available including estimates of fair value which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value 
the company has not historically recorded an impairment to its goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
the company completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets and determined that  as of february   no impairment existed because the fair value of these assets substantially exceeded their carrying values 
in the future  if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired  the company will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs 
self insurance the company utilizes a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks including workers compensation  general liability  automobile liability and employee related health care benefits a portion of which is paid by its employees 
liabilities associated with the risks that the company retains are estimated by considering historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
although the company s claims experience has not displayed substantial volatility in the past  actual experience could materially vary from its historical experience in the future 
factors that affect these estimates include but are not limited to inflation  the number and severity of claims and regulatory changes 
in the future  if the company concludes an adjustment to self insurance accruals is required  the liability will be adjusted accordingly 
litigation the company records an estimated liability related to its various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business when and to the extent that it concludes a liability is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
such estimated loss is based on available information and advice from outside counsel  where appropriate 
as additional information becomes available  the company reassesses the potential liability related to claims and legal actions and revises its estimated liabilities  as appropriate 
the company expects the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity

table of contents of claims which could be asserted in the future  and future claims could have a material impact on its earnings 
store opening  expansion  relocation and closing costs store opening  expansion  relocation and closing costs  including markdowns  asset residual values and projected occupancy costs  are charged to earnings as incurred 
stock based compensation the company uses a black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of its stock options 
the black scholes model includes various assumptions  including the expected life of stock options  the expected risk free interest rate and the expected volatility 
these assumptions reflect the company s best estimates  but they involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside the control of the company 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used  total stock based compensation cost could have been materially impacted 
furthermore  if the company uses different assumptions for future grants  stock based compensation cost could be materially impacted in future periods 
the company determines its assumptions for the black scholes option pricing model in accordance with the accounting guidance related to stock compensation 
the expected life of stock options is estimated based on historical experience 
the expected risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury constant maturity interest rate whose term is consistent with the expected life of the stock options 
expected volatility is based on the average of historical and implied volatility 
the historical volatility is determined by observing actual prices of the company s stock over a period commensurate with the expected life of the awards 
the implied volatility represents the implied volatility of the company s call options  which are actively traded on multiple exchanges  had remaining maturities in excess of twelve months  had market prices close to the exercise prices of the employee stock options and were measured on the stock option grant date 
the company is required to record stock based compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures 
the company s forfeiture rate assumption used in determining its stock based compensation expense is estimated based on historical data 
the actual forfeiture rate could differ from these estimates 
taxes the company accounts for its income taxes using the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date 
the company intends to reinvest the unremitted earnings of its canadian subsidiary 
accordingly  no provision has been made for us or additional non us taxes with respect to these earnings 
in the event of repatriation to the us  in most cases such earnings would be subject to us income taxes 
the company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is at least more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the taxing authorities 
the company expects continued volatility in the effective tax rate from year to year because the company is required each year to determine whether new information changes the assessment of both the probability that a tax position will effectively be sustained and the appropriateness of the amount of recognized benefit 
the company also accrues for certain other taxes as required by their operations 

table of contents judgment is required in determining the provision for income and other taxes and related accruals  deferred tax assets and liabilities
