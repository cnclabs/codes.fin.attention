item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis provides a review of the results of operations  financial condition and liquidity and capital resources of visa inc and its subsidiaries visa  we  our and the company on a historical basis and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings  as well as those factors that may affect future earnings 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item of this report 
overview visa is a global payments technology company that connects consumers  businesses  financial institutions and governments around the world to fast  secure and reliable electronic payments 
we provide our clients with payment processing platforms that encompass consumer credit  debit  prepaid and commercial payments 
we facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among financial institutions  merchants  consumers  businesses and government entities 
each of these constituencies has played a key role in the ongoing worldwide migration from paper based to electronic forms of payment  and we believe that this transformation continues to yield significant growth opportunities  particularly outside the united states 
we continue to explore additional opportunities to enhance our competitive position by expanding the scope of payment services we provide 
overall economic conditions and regulatory environment 
our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending 
our business performance during fiscal reflects the impacts of a modest global economic recovery 
the dodd frank act 
as of october   in accordance with the dodd frank act  the federal reserve capped the maximum us debit interchange reimbursement fee assessed for cards issued by large financial institutions at twenty one cents plus five basis points  before applying an interim fraud adjustment up to an additional one cent 
this amounted to a significant reduction from the average system wide interchange fees charged before the dodd frank act was implemented 
the federal reserve has also issued regulations requiring issuers to make at least two unaffiliated networks available for processing debit transactions on each debit card 
the rules also prohibit us and issuers from restricting a merchant s ability to direct the routing of electronic debit transactions over any of the networks that an issuer has enabled to process those transactions 
the interchange  exclusivity and routing regulations have impacted our pricing  reduced the number and volume of us debit payments we process and decreased associated revenues 
a number of our clients have sought fee reductions or increased incentives from us to offset their own lost revenue 
some have reduced the number of debit cards they issue and reduced investments they make in marketing and rewards programs 
some have imposed new or higher fees on debit cards or demand deposit account relationships 
some have elected to issue fewer cards enabled with visa affiliated networks 
additionally  the routing regulations have allowed merchants to redirect transactions or steer cardholders to other networks based on lowest cost or other factors 
we have had to re examine and renegotiate certain of our client contracts to ensure that their terms comply with new regulations and will continue to do so with others 
as a result  our clients have sought and will continue to seek to renegotiate terms relating to fees  incentives and routing 
in some cases  we may lose placement completely on issuers debit cards 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we began implementation of our strategy to mitigate the negative impacts from the dodd frank act to some extent by making pricing modifications and working with our clients and other business partners to win merchant preference to route transactions over our network 
for fiscal  the overall net impact of the dodd frank act  including restructured pricing  incentives  other mitigation strategies and volume loss  was a decrease of approximately in diluted earnings per class a common share 
our broad platform of payment products continues to provide substantial value to both merchants and consumers 
we believe that the continuing worldwide secular shift to electronic currency may help buffer the impacts of the dodd frank act  as reflected in our overall payments volume growth  particularly outside the united states 
as a leader in the us debit industry  we continue to develop and refine our competitive business models to adapt to the dodd frank act and mitigate some of its negative impacts 
we remain committed and prepared to adapt to and compete effectively under this new us debit regulatory environment 
notice of proposed adjustment 
on may   the us internal revenue service the irs issued a notice of proposed adjustment nopa to our fiscal us federal income tax return seeking to disallow the 
table of contents deduction of settlement payments associated with the american express litigation made during that fiscal year 
however  on august   the irs issued a chief counsel advice cca  supporting our position that visa is entitled to the deduction  and subsequently the irs issued a revised revenue agent report rar effectively withdrawing the nopa 
the irs may still challenge any income tax return position taken  including the deductibility of covered litigation payments made in fiscal or any future year  until the statute of limitations has closed for each applicable year 
the statute of limitations for fiscal is expected to expire in june of however  given the cca and revised rar  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reevaluated and reversed all previously recorded tax reserves and accrued interest associated with uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense recorded in fiscal through the third quarter of fiscal this increased our net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal by million 
the reversal of tax reserves and related interest included million related to reserves taken in the current year  and million related to reserves taken in previous years 
multidistrict litigation proceedings mdl 
on october   visa  mastercard  various us financial institution defendants and the class plaintiffs signed a settlement agreement to resolve the class plaintiffs claims in the interchange mdl 
we also signed a settlement agreement to resolve the claims brought by a group of individual merchants which were consolidated with the mdl for coordination of pre trial proceedings 
the settlement with the class plaintiffs is subject to final court approval  which we cannot assure will be received  and to the adjudication of any appeals

adjusted financial results 
our financial results for fiscal and reflect the impact of several significant items that we believe are not indicative of our financial performance in the current or future years  as they either are non recurring  have no cash impact or are related to amounts covered by the retrospective responsibility plan 
as such  we believe the presentation of adjusted financial results excluding the following amounts provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the periods presented 
reversal of tax reserves 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reevaluated and reversed all previously recorded tax reserves and accrued interest associated with uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense recorded in fiscal through the third quarter of fiscal this increased our net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal by million 
the reversal of tax reserves and related interest included million related to reserves taken in the current year  and million related to reserves taken in previous years 
litigation provision 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a litigation provision of billion and related tax benefits associated with the interchange mdl  which is covered by the retrospective responsibility plan 
monetary liabilities from settlements of  or judgments in  the covered litigation will be paid from the litigation escrow account 
see note retrospective responsibility plan and note legal matters to our consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax adjustment 
during the second quarter of fiscal  our reported financial results benefited from a one time  non cash adjustment of million related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities attributable to changes in the california state apportionment rules 
revaluation of visa europe put option 
during fiscal  we recorded a decrease of million in the fair value of the visa europe put option  which resulted in the recognition of non cash  non operating other income in our financial results 
this amount is not subject to income tax and therefore had no impact on our reported income tax provision 
the reduction in the fair value of the put option was the result of declines in our estimated long term price to earnings ratio as compared to the estimated ratio applicable to visa europe and did not reflect any change in the likelihood that visa europe will exercise its option 
the following table presents our adjusted financial results for the years ended september  and

reduction in as converted shares 
during fiscal  total as converted class a common stock was reduced by million shares  using billion of operating cash on hand 
of the billion  million was used to repurchase class a common stock in the open market 
in addition  we made deposits totaling billion of operating cash into the litigation escrow account previously established under the retrospective responsibility plan 
these deposits have the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing our class a common stock  because they reduce the class b conversion rate and consequently the as converted class a common stock share count 
in july  our board of directors authorized a billion share repurchase program to be in effect through july as of september   the program had remaining authorized funds of million 
in october  our board of directors authorized an additional billion share repurchase program to be in effect through october all share repurchase programs authorized prior to july have been completed 
nominal payments volume and transaction counts 
payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues  and processed transactions are the primary driver for our data processing revenues 
compared to the prior year  overall payments volume increased as a result of continuing double digit percentage growth in consumer credit and commercial payments volume worldwide 
these increases were moderated by an anticipated deceleration in consumer debit growth  primarily due to the impacts of the dodd frank act 
excluding us debit transactions  which reflect the impacts of the dodd frank act  the number of processed transactions continues to increase at a healthy rate  reflecting the continuing worldwide shift to electronic currency 
the following tables set forth nominal payments volume for the periods presented in nominal dollars

percentage changes are calculated based on whole numbers  not the rounded numbers presented 
service revenues in a given quarter are assessed based on payments volume in the prior quarter 
therefore  service revenues reported for the twelve months ended september   and  were based on payments volume reported by our financial institution clients for the twelve months ended june   and  respectively 
includes prepaid volume 
total nominal volume is the sum of total nominal payments volume and cash volume 
total nominal payments volume is the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased 
cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions  balance access transactions  balance transfers and convenience checks 
total nominal volume is provided by our financial institution clients  subject to verification by visa 
from time to time  previously submitted volume information may be updated 
prior year volume information presented in these tables has not been updated  as subsequent adjustments were not material

transactions include  but are not limited to  authorization  settlement payment network connectivity  fraud management  payment security management  tax services and delivery address verification 
since its july acquisition  cybersource activity has primarily contributed to our data processing revenues 
includes cybersource transactions prior to the july acquisition 
results of operations operating revenues our operating revenues are primarily generated from payments volume on visa branded cards for goods and services  as well as the number  size and type of transactions processed on our payment processing platforms 
we do not earn revenues from  or bear credit risk with respect to  interest or fees paid by cardholders on visa branded cards 
our issuing clients have the responsibility for issuing cards and determining the interest rates and fees paid by cardholders  and most other competitive card features 
we generally do not earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for card acceptance by the issuing bank  including the merchant discount rate 
our acquiring clients  which are generally responsible for soliciting merchants  establish and earn these fees 
the following sets forth the components of our operating revenues service revenues consist primarily of revenues earned for providing clients with a supported global business infrastructure and for services which support the various product platforms that enable clients to deliver visa products and payment services 
current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of pricing applied to the prior quarter s payments volume 
service revenues also include assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives  which are recognized in the same period the related volume is transacted 
data processing revenues are earned for authorization  clearing  settlement  transaction processing services  network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our clients globally and visa europe 
data processing revenues are also earned for transactions processed by cybersource s online payment gateway and playspan s virtual goods payment platform 
data processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered 
international transaction revenues are earned for processing cross border transactions  and currency conversion activities 
cross border transactions arise when the cardholder s issuer country is different from the merchant s country 
international transaction revenues are generally driven by cross border payments and cash volume 
other revenues consist primarily of license fees for use of the visa brand  revenues earned from visa europe in connection with the visa europe framework agreement  fees from cardholder services  licensing and certification and certain activities related to our acquired entities 
other revenues also include optional service or product enhancements  such as extended cardholder protection and concierge services 
client incentives represent contracts with clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume  increase product acceptance and win merchant preference to route transactions over our network 
these incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues 
operating expenses personnel includes salaries  incentive compensation  stock based compensation  fringe benefits and contractor expense 
network and processing primarily represents expenses for the operation of our processing network  including maintenance  equipment rental and fees for other data processing services 

table of contents marketing includes expenses associated with advertising and marketing campaigns  sponsorships and other related promotions to promote the visa brand 
professional fees consist of fees for consulting  legal and other professional services 
depreciation and amortization includes depreciation expense for property and equipment  as well as amortization of purchased and internally developed software 
also included in this amount is amortization of finite lived intangible assets primarily obtained through acquisitions 
general and administrative primarily consists of facilities costs  foreign exchange gains and losses and other corporate expenses in support of our business 
litigation provision is an estimate of litigation expense and is based on management s understanding of our litigation profile  the specifics of the cases  advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management s best estimate of incurred loss at the balance sheet dates 
other income expense interest income expense primarily includes accrued interest and penalties related to reserves for uncertain tax positions 
investment income represents returns on our fixed income securities and other investments 
investment income also includes gains on the sale of and cash dividends received from other investments 
other non operating income primarily relates to gains and losses earned on equity method investments and the change in the fair value of the visa europe put option 
visa inc fiscal  and operating revenues the following table sets forth our operating revenues earned in the united states  in the rest of the world and from visa europe 
revenues earned from visa europe are a result of our contractual arrangement with visa europe  as governed by the framework agreement that provides for trademark and technology licenses and bilateral services

percentage changes are calculated based on whole numbers  not the rounded numbers presented 
the increase in operating revenues primarily reflects continued growth in our underlying business drivers nominal payments volume  processed transactions and cross border volume 
operating revenues also benefited from pricing modifications made on various services 
these benefits were partially offset by volume loss and increases to client incentives implemented in the us during fiscal as part of our strategy to mitigate the impacts of the dodd frank act 
we expect low double digit percentage growth in our operating revenues for the full fiscal year 
our operating revenues  primarily service revenues and international transaction revenues  are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the us dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to us dollars 
there was no significant impact on the year over year growth for fiscal  and  as the effect of exchange rate movements was substantially mitigated through our 
table of contents hedging program

percentage changes are calculated based on whole numbers  not the rounded numbers presented 
service revenues increased in fiscal primarily due to growth in nominal payments volume 
the growth in service revenues was greater than the growth in nominal payments volume primarily reflecting differences in geography specific pricing 
service revenues increased in fiscal primarily due to growth in nominal payments volume combined with benefits from competitive pricing actions 
data processing revenues increased in fiscal primarily as a result of the implementation of our strategy to mitigate the negative impacts from the dodd frank act to some extent through pricing modifications and working with our clients and other business partners to win merchant preference to route transactions over our network 
this price restructuring included the implementation of the fixed acquirer network fee  which was partially offset by reductions in certain variable fees 
while data processing fees benefited from the price restructuring that became effective in the third quarter of fiscal  increased merchant and acquirer incentives executed as part of this strategy resulted in higher client incentive levels  which partially offset this increase 
data processing revenues for fiscal also benefited from overall growth in processed transactions of  which reflected an anticipated decline in us debit transactions processed as a result of certain provisions of the dodd frank act becoming effective the third quarter of fiscal the deceleration in processed transaction growth was led by interlink  one of our lowest yielding products in the us  which decreased in the second half of fiscal compared to the same prior year period 
this negative impact was more than offset by solid growth in cybersource billable transactions  visa transactions processed outside of the us  us credit transactions and visa debit transactions  which exclude interlink 
data processing revenues increased in fiscal primarily due to growth in processed transactions and inclusion of a full year of revenue attributable to cybersource 
this growth was partially offset by the effects of negotiated pricing from certain client contracts and a change to present revenues and offsetting expenses associated with the processing of non visa network transactions on a net basis instead of a gross basis 
international transaction revenues increased in fiscal and primarily reflecting and growth in nominal cross border volume  respectively 
other revenues increased in fiscal primarily due to an increase in license fees as a result of payments volume growth 
other revenues decreased in fiscal primarily due to a change to present revenues and offsetting expenses related to the visa extras rewards program on a net basis instead of a gross basis  and as a result of a large issuer that converted away from the platform entirely in june the decrease was partially offset by increases in license fees and the inclusion of revenue from our acquired entities 

table of contents client incentives increased in fiscal reflecting incentives incurred on long term client contracts that were initiated or renewed during fiscal  including a number of significant long term merchant and acquirer contracts executed as part of our strategy to mitigate the impact of the dodd frank act 
client incentives also increased as a result of overall growth in global payments volume and certain one time incentives incurred outside the us the amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations  actual client performance  amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts 
we expect incentives as a percentage of gross revenues to be in the range of to for the full fiscal year 
increases in client incentives during fiscal reflected growth in global payments volume and incentives incurred on significant long term client contracts that were initiated or renewed during fiscal operating expenses the following table sets forth components of our total operating expenses for the periods presented

excluding the litigation provision of billion recorded in fiscal  associated with litigation covered by the retrospective responsibility plan  operating expenses for fiscal were billion  an increase of over the prior year on an adjusted basis 
personnel increased in fiscal primarily due to increases in headcount throughout the organization combined with higher employee incentive related costs 
the increase also reflects annualized costs from our acquisitions of playspan and fundamo in march and june  respectively 
the increase in fiscal primarily reflects the inclusion of new employees from our acquisitions of cybersource  playspan and fundamo 
the increases in headcount reflect our strategy to invest for future growth  particularly outside the us  in support of our core business  as well as our ecommerce and mobile initiatives 
network and processing increased in fiscal primarily due to higher fees paid for the operation of our processing network attributable to increased transaction volumes 
the decrease in fiscal reflects the change to present revenues and offsetting expenses associated with the processing of non visa network transactions on a net basis instead of on a gross basis 
this decline was partially offset by increased investment in technology projects and the inclusion of cybersource and playspan activities 
marketing remained flat in fiscal despite an increase in spending to support new product initiatives and our sponsorship of the summer olympics 
we expect to incur under billion of marketing expense in fiscal  including incremental investment to support our key country growth strategies and new product initiatives 
the decrease in fiscal primarily reflects a change to present revenues and offsetting expenses related to the visa extras rewards program on a net basis instead of on a gross basis  combined with the 
table of contents impact of a large issuer converting away from the platform entirely in june the decline in marketing expense also reflects the absence of spending associated with the winter olympics and the fifa world cup incurred in the prior year 
the decline was partially offset by the inclusion of cybersource activity 
professional fees increased in fiscal and  primarily reflecting greater investment in technology projects to support our ecommerce and mobile initiatives 
depreciation and amortization increased in fiscal  primarily due to additional depreciation expense from our ongoing investments in technology assets and infrastructure to support our core business as well as our ecommerce and mobile initiatives 
the increase in fiscal primarily reflects the impact of newly acquired technology and intangible assets from our acquisitions of cybersource and playspan in july and march  respectively  offset by the absence of depreciation and amortization on the incremental basis in assets recorded in our october reorganization  as these assets were fully depreciated as of september  see note acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements 
general and administrative increased primarily due to travel activities in support of our international expansion  combined with the absence of unrealized foreign exchange gains recorded in fiscal upon the remeasurement of monetary asset and liabilities held by foreign subsidiaries into their functional currencies 
the increase in fiscal is primarily due to increased travel and the inclusion of cybersource activity  combined with reserves for a potential government assessment in one of our international geographies in fiscal litigation provision in fiscal reflects a billion accrual related to litigation covered by the retrospective responsibility plan 
the credit to the provision in fiscal was primarily the result of a million pre tax gain recognized related to the prepayment of the remaining obligations under the retailers litigation settlement  combined with the release of accruals for certain other legal matters settled during fiscal see note retrospective responsibility plan and note legal matters to our consolidated financial statements

interest income for fiscal reflects the reversal of previously accrued interest associated with tax reserves for uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense 
interest expense in fiscal reflects lower interest accretion due to declining litigation balances as well as the reversal of previously accrued interest upon the effective settlement of uncertainties surrounding the timing of certain deductions for income tax purposes

see note visa europe to our consolidated financial statements 
effective income tax rate the effective income tax rate of in fiscal is lower than the effective income tax rate of for fiscal and  primarily due to the impact of the following in fiscal the reversal of previously recorded tax reserves associated with uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense  a decrease in our overall state tax rate due to changes in the california apportionment rules and the associated one time  non cash benefit of million from the remeasurement of existing net deferred tax liabilities primarily related to the billion of indefinite lived intangible assets recorded in our reorganization  a one time benefit recognized upon initial recognition of foreign tax credits  the effect of applying the foregoing adjustments to a pre tax income that was reduced by a billion covered litigation provision  and the absence of nontaxable revaluations of the visa europe put option

adjusted effective income tax rate 
our financial results for fiscal reflect the impact of several significant items that we believe are not indicative of our financial performance in the current or future years  as they are either non recurring  have no cash impact or are related to amounts covered by the retrospective responsibility plan 
as such  we have presented our adjusted effective income tax rate in the table below  which we believe provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the fiscal year 
our adjusted effective income tax rate for fiscal excludes the reversal of previously recorded tax reserves and accrued interest associated with uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense  additional covered litigation provision recorded  and a one time  non cash benefit from the remeasurement of existing net deferred tax liabilities attributable to changes in the california state apportionment rules

our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with our corporate objectives 
the objectives of our treasury policies are to provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios  ensure payments on required litigation settlements  ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities  make planned capital investments in our business  pay dividends and repurchase our shares at the discretion of our board of directors  and 
table of contents optimize income earned by investing excess cash in securities that enable us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs 
based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short term and long term liquidity needs  we believe that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next months 
we will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance  current economic and capital market conditions  and other relevant circumstances

total cash provided by operating activities was higher during fiscal compared to prior year  primarily reflecting higher operating revenue in fiscal we believe that cash flow generated from operating activities will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs 
total cash provided by operating activities was higher during fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily reflecting continued growth in our net income and the absence of a million prepayment of our retailers litigation obligation in fiscal investing activities

funds held by our foreign subsidiaries include cash  cash equivalents and available for sale investment securities  both short and long term 
if these funds are needed for our operations in the us  we would be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds  up to the amount of billion  which we intend to indefinitely reinvest outside of the us our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our us operations 
available for sale investment securities 
our investment portfolio is designed to invest excess cash in securities which enable us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs 
our investment portfolio primarily consists of debt securities issued by the us treasury or us government sponsored agencies 
the majority of these investments  billion  are classified as non current as they have stated maturities of more than one year from the balance sheet date 
however  these investments are generally available to meet short term liquidity needs 
factors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include changes to credit ratings of the securities  uncertainty related to regulatory developments  actions by central banks and other monetary authorities  
table of contents and the ongoing strength and quality of credit markets 
we will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions 
however  if current market conditions deteriorate  the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired  which could adversely impact our financial results 
we have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment 
see item a risk factors 
revolving credit facilities 
in february  we entered into a billion five year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks including affiliates of certain holders of shares of our class b and class c common stock and certain of our clients and affiliates of our clients 
loans under the five year facility may be in the form of base rate advance  which will bear interest at a rate equal to the higher of the federal funds rate plus and the bank of america prime rate  eurocurrency advance  which will bear interest at a rate equal to libor as adjusted for applicable reserve requirements plus an applicable cost adjustment and an applicable margin of to based on our credit rating  or us swing loan  euro swing loan  or foreign currency swing loan  which will bear interest at the rate equal to the applicable swing loan rate for that currency plus the same applicable margin plus additionally for euro and sterling loans  an applicable reserve requirement and cost adjustment 
we also agreed to pay a facility fee on the aggregate commitment amount  whether used or unused  at a rate ranging from to and a utilization fee on loans at a rate ranging from to based on our credit rating 
currently  the applicable margin is  the facility fee is and the utilization fee is 
this facility contains certain covenants  including financial covenant requirements relating to a maximum level of debt to ebitda and events of default customary for financings of this type 
this facility expires on february  we are in the process of replacing this facility in fiscal there were no borrowings under this facility and we were in compliance with all covenants during and at the end of fiscal us commercial paper program 
we maintain a million us commercial paper program  which provides for the issuance of unsecured debt with maturities up to days from the date of issuance at interest rates generally extended to companies with comparable credit ratings 
the commercial paper program is a source of short term borrowed funds that may be used from time to time to cover short term cash needs 
we had no obligations outstanding under this program during and at the end of fiscal there are no financial covenants related to this program 
universal shelf registration statement 
in july  we filed a registration statement with the us securities and exchange commission using a shelf registration process 
as permitted by the registration statement  we may  from time to time  sell shares of debt or equity securities in one or more transactions 
the registration statement expires in july litigation escrow account 
pursuant to the terms of the retrospective responsibility plan  we maintain a litigation escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of  or judgments in  the covered litigation will be payable 
when the company funds the litigation escrow account  the shares of class b common stock held by our stockholders are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class b common stock to shares of class a common stock 
see note retrospective responsibility plan and note legal matters to our consolidated financial statements 
the balance in this account at september   was billion and is reflected as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet 
as these funds are restricted for the sole purpose of making payments related to the covered litigation matters  as described below under uses of liquidity  we do not rely on them for other operational needs 
credit ratings at september   our credit ratings by standard and poor s and moody s were as follows standard and poor s moody s debt type rating outlook rating outlook short term unsecured debt a stable p stable long term unsecured debt a stable a stable various factors affect our credit ratings  including changes in our operating performance  the economic environment  conditions in the electronic payment industry  our financial position and changes in our business strategy 
we do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded 
if a downgrade were to occur  it could adversely impact  among other things  our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets 
uses of liquidity 
table of contents payments settlement 
payments settlement due from and due to issuing and acquiring clients represents a substantial daily liquidity requirement 
us dollar settlements are typically settled within the same day and do not result in a net receivable or payable balance  while settlement currencies other than the us dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days  consistent with industry practice for such transactions 
during fiscal  we often did not need to fund settlement working capital as indicated by the fact that our average daily net settlement position was a payable of million  although our greatest working capital requirement was a peak net settlement receivable balance of million 
covered litigation 
we are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters  including certain litigation that we refer to as the covered litigation 
as noted above  monetary liabilities from settlements of  or judgments in  the covered litigation are payable from the litigation escrow account 
during fiscal  we made million in covered litigation payments that were funded from the litigation escrow account 
at september  the litigation escrow account had an available balance of billion 
in october  we made an additional payment of million from the litigation escrow account to the individual plaintiffs settlement fund

during fiscal  total as converted class a common stock was reduced by million shares  using billion of operating cash on hand 
of the billion  million was used to repurchase class a common stock in the open market 
in addition  we made deposits totaling billion of operating cash into the litigation escrow account previously established under the retrospective responsibility plan 
these deposits have the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing the company s class a common stock  because they reduce the class b conversion rate and consequently the as converted class a common stock share count 
in july  our board of directors authorized a billion share repurchase program to be in effect through july at september   this share repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of million 
in october  our board of directors authorized an additional billion share repurchase program to be in effect through october all share repurchase programs authorized prior to july have been completed 
see note stockholders equity to our consolidated financial statements 
dividends 
during fiscal  we paid million in dividends 
on october   our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of per share of class a common stock determined in the case of class b and class c common stock on an as converted basis 
we expect to pay approximately million in connection with this dividend in december see note stockholders equity to our consolidated financial statements 
we expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash  subject to approval by our board of directors 
class b and class c common stock will share ratably on an as converted basis in such future dividends 
visa europe put option 
we have granted visa europe a perpetual put option which  if exercised  will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of visa europe from its members 
visa europe may exercise the put option at any time 
the put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the visa europe shares  which subject to certain adjustments  applies visa inc s forward price to earnings multiple  or the p e ratio as defined in the option agreement at the time the option is exercised to visa europe s adjusted sustainable income for the forward month period  or the adjusted sustainable income as defined in the option agreement 
the calculation of visa europe s adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items 
upon exercise  the key inputs to this formula  including visa europe s adjusted sustainable income  will be the result of negotiation between us and visa europe 
the put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price 
at september   we determined the fair value of the put option liability to be approximately million 
while this amount represents the fair value of the put option at september   it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised 
the purchase price we could be obligated to pay days after exercise will represent a substantial financial obligation  which could be several billion dollars or more 
we may need to obtain third party financing  either by borrowing funds or undertaking a subsequent equity offering in order to fund this payment 
the amount of that potential obligation could vary dramatically based on  among other things  visa europe s adjusted sustainable income and our p e ratio  in each 
table of contents case  as negotiated at the time the put option is exercised 
given the perpetual nature of the put option and the various economic conditions which could be present at the time of exercise  our ultimate obligation in the event of exercise cannot be reliably estimated 
the following table calculates our total obligation assuming  for illustrative purposes only  a range of p e ratios for visa inc and assuming that visa europe demonstrates million of adjusted sustainable income at the date of exercise 
the million of assumed adjusted sustainable income provided below is for illustrative purposes only 
this does not represent an estimate of the amount of adjusted sustainable income visa europe would have been able to demonstrate at september   or will be able to demonstrate at any point in time in the future 
should visa europe elect to exercise its option  we believe it is likely that it will implement changes in its business operations to move to a for profit model in order to maximize its adjusted sustainable income and  as a result  to increase the purchase price 
the table also provides the amount of increase or decrease in the payout  assuming the same range of estimated p e ratios  for each million of adjusted sustainable income above or below the assumed million demonstrated at the time of exercise 
at september   our estimated long term p e ratio was x and the long term p e differential  the difference between this ratio and the estimated ratio applicable to visa europe  was x 
at september   the spot p e ratio was x and the spot p e differential  the difference between this ratio and the estimated spot ratio applicable to visa europe  was x 
these ratios are for reference purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the ratio or differential that could be applicable if the put option were exercised at any point in the future 
visa inc s forward price to earnings ratio payout assuming adjusted sustainable income of million increase decrease in payout for each million of adjusted sustainable income above below million in millions in millions given the large range of different economic environments and circumstances under which visa europe could decide to exercise its option  the ultimate purchase price could be several billion dollars or more 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
we sponsor various qualified and non qualified defined benefit pension plans that generally provide benefits based on years of service  age and eligible compensation 
we also sponsor a postretirement benefit plan that provides postretirement medical benefits for retirees and dependents upon meeting minimum age and service requirements 
our policy with respect to our qualified pension plan is to contribute annually not less than the minimum required under the employee retirement income security act  or erisa 
our non qualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans are funded on a current basis 
we typically fund our qualified pension plan in september of each year 
funding does not impact current period pension expense but has the positive impact of reducing future period expense for the plan 
in fiscal  and  we made contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans of million  million  and million  respectively 
in fiscal  we anticipate funding our defined benefit pension plans and postretirement plan by approximately million 
the actual contribution amount will vary depending upon the funded status of the pension plan  movements in the discount rate  performance of the plan assets  and related tax consequences 
capital expenditures 
our capital expenditures increased during fiscal due to investment in technology  infrastructure and growth initiatives 
we expect capital expenditures to be in the million to million range in fiscal  as we continue to make ongoing investments in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support our core business as well as our ecommerce and mobile initiatives 
acquisitions 
there were no material acquisitions during fiscal  compared to fiscal  when we acquired playspan and fundamo for a total of million  net of million in cash received 
see note acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements 
we will continue to pursue our growth initiatives and to expand our product offerings through acquisitions and strategic partnerships in the future 
fair value measurements financial instruments the assessment of fair value of our financial instruments is based on a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair 
table of contents value 
observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party  whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability 
as of september   our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included approximately billion of assets and million of liabilities 
of these instruments  million  or less than  had significant unobservable inputs  with the visa europe put option liability constituting million of this amount 
at september   debt instruments in this category included million of auction rate securities 
see note fair value measurements and investments to our consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements our off balance sheet arrangements are primarily comprised of guarantees and indemnifications 
visa has no off balance sheet debt  other than lease and purchase order commitments as discussed below and reflected in our contractual obligations table 
indemnifications we indemnify clients for settlement losses suffered by failure of any other customer to honor visa cards  traveler s cheques  or other instruments processed in accordance with our operating regulations 
the amount of the indemnification is limited to the amount of unsettled visa payment transactions at any point in time 
we maintain global credit settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met 
see note summary of significant accounting policies and note settlement guarantee management to our consolidated financial statements 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into contractual arrangements with financial institutions and other clients under which we may agree to indemnify the client for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement 
contractual obligations our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity 
the contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on and off balance sheet transactions that represent a material expected or contractually committed future obligation as of september  we believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from our operations and available credit facilities  or the litigation escrow account 
payments due by period less than year years years more than years total in millions purchase orders leases client incentives marketing and sponsorship litigation settlement payments dividends total  represents agreements to purchase goods and services that specify significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
includes both operating and capital leases for premises  equipment and software licenses  which range in terms from one to eighteen years 
represents future cash payments for incentive agreements with select clients under various programs designed to build payments volume  increase acceptance and win merchant preference to route transactions over our network 
these agreements  which range in terms from one to thirteen years  can provide card issuance and or conversion support  volume growth targets and marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements 
payments under these agreements will generally be offset by revenues earned from higher corresponding payments and transaction volumes 
these payment amounts are estimates and will change based on customer performance  amendments to existing contracts or execution of new contracts 
related amounts disclosed in note commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements 
table of contents represent the associated expected reduction of revenue related to these agreements which we estimate we will record 
visa is a party to contractual sponsorship agreements ranging from approximately three to sixteen years 
these contracts are designed to help increase visa branded cards and volumes 
over the life of these contracts  visa is required to make payments in exchange for certain advertising and promotional rights 
in connection with these contractual commitments  visa has an obligation to spend certain minimum amounts for advertising and marketing promotion over the life of the contract 
for obligations where the individual years of spend are not specified in the contract  we have estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent 
visa  mastercard  various us financial institution defendants  and the class plaintiffs signed a settlement agreement to resolve the class plaintiffs claims in the interchange multidistrict litigation proceedings on october  the amount in the table represents the maximum amount expected to be paid out in fiscal under the class plaintiffs settlement agreement and the individual plaintiffs settlement agreement from the litigation escrow account 
this amount includes the million payment to the individual plaintiffs settlement fund made in october a litigation provision of billion for the covered litigation was booked during fiscal see note retrospective responsibility plan and note legal matters to our consolidated financial statements 
includes expected dividend amount of million as dividends were declared on october  and will be paid on december  to all holders of record of visa s common stock as of november  we have liabilities for uncertain tax positions of million 
at september   we also accrued million of interest and million of penalties associated with our uncertain tax positions 
we cannot determine the range of cash payments that will be made and the timing of the cash settlements  if any  associated with our uncertain tax positions 
therefore  no amounts related to these obligations have been included in the table 
visa granted a perpetual put option to visa europe  which if exercised  will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of visa europe from its members 
due to the perpetual nature of the instrument and the various economic conditions  which could exist when the put is exercised  the ultimate amount and timing of visa s obligation  if any  cannot be reliably estimated 
therefore  no amounts related to this obligation have been included in the table 
however  given the range of different economic environments and circumstances under which visa europe could exercise its option  the ultimate purchase price could be several billion dollars or more 
the fair value of the visa europe put option itself totaling million at september  has also been excluded from this table as it does not represent the amount or an estimate of the amount of visa s obligation in the event of exercise 
see liquidity and critical accounting estimates sections of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note visa europe to our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate the need to make contributions to our pension plan after considering the funded status of the pension plan  movements in the discount rate  performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences 
expected contributions to our pension plan have not been included in the table as such amounts are dependent upon the considerations discussed above  and may result in a wide range of amounts 
see note pension  postretirement and other benefits to our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which requires us to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported 
see note summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements 
we have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period 
however  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
we believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results  as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
revenue recognition client incentives critical estimates 
we enter into incentive agreements with select clients and other business partners designed to build payments volume  increase product acceptance and win merchant preference to route transactions over our network 
these incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues  however  if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established they are accounted for as operating expenses 
we generally capitalize advance incentive payments under these agreements if select criteria are met 

table of contents the capitalization criteria include the existence of future economic benefits to visa  the existence of legally enforceable recoverability clauses  such as early termination clauses  management s ability and intent to enforce the recoverability clauses and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amounts deferred 
capitalized amounts are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the corresponding period of economic benefit 
incentives not yet paid are accrued systematically and rationally based on management s estimate of each client s performance 
these accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted as appropriate  based on changes in performance expectations  actual client performance  amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts assumptions and judgment 
estimation of client incentives relies on forecasts of payments volume  card issuance and card conversion 
performance is estimated using customer reported information  transactional information accumulated from our systems  historical information and discussions with our clients 
impact if actual results differ from assumptions 
if our clients actual performance or recoverable cash flows are not consistent with our estimates  client incentives may be materially different than initially recorded 
increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payments and transaction volume  which drive our net revenue 
as a result  in the event incentive payments exceed estimates  such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable 
for the year ended september   client incentives represented of gross operating revenues 
fair value visa europe put option critical estimates 
we have granted visa europe a perpetual put option which  if exercised  will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of visa europe from its members 
the put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the visa europe shares  which  subject to certain adjustments  applies our forward price to earnings multiple  or the p e ratio as defined in the option agreement  at the time the option is exercised to visa europe s projected adjusted sustainable income for the forward month period  or the adjusted sustainable income as defined in the option agreement 
the calculation of visa europe s adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items 
upon exercise  the key inputs to this formula  including visa europe s adjusted sustainable income  will be the result of negotiation between us and visa europe 
the put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price 
see note visa europe to our consolidated financial statements for further detail regarding the calculation of the put exercise price under the agreement 
the fair value of visa europe s option was estimated to be approximately million at september  while the put option is in fact non transferable  this amount  recorded in our financial statements  represents our estimate of the amount we would be required to pay a third party market participant to transfer the potential obligation in an orderly transaction 
the fair value of the put option is computed by comparing the estimated strike price  under the terms of the put agreement  to the estimated fair value of visa europe 
the fair value of visa europe is defined as the estimated amount a third party market participant might pay in an arm s length transaction under normal business conditions 
a probability of exercise assumption is applied to reflect the possibility that visa europe will never exercise its option 
while this amount represents the fair value of the put option at september   it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised  which could be several billion dollars or more 
see the liquidity and capital resources section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further discussion 
assumptions and judgment 
the most significant estimates used in the valuation of the put option are the assumed probability that visa europe will elect to exercise its option and the estimated differential between the forward price to earnings multiple applicable to our common stock  as defined in the put option agreement  and that applicable to visa europe on a stand alone basis at the time of exercise  which we refer to as the p e differential 
probability of exercise exercise of the put option is at the sole discretion of visa europe on behalf of the visa europe shareholders pursuant to authority granted to visa europe  under its articles of association 
we estimate the assumed probability of exercise based on reasonably available information including  but not limited to 
table of contents i visa europe s stated intentions  ii indications that visa europe is preparing to exercise as reflected in its reported financial results  iii evaluation of market conditions  including the regulatory environment  that could impact the potential future profitability of visa europe  and iv qualitative factors applicable to visa europe s largest members  which could indicate a change in their need or desire to liquidate their investment holdings 
p e differential the p e differential is determined by estimating the relative difference in the forward price to earnings multiples applicable to our common stock  as defined in the put option agreement  and that applicable to visa europe at the time of exercise 
for valuation purposes  the forward price to earnings multiple applicable to our common stock at the time of exercise is estimated by evaluating various quantitative measures and qualitative factors 
quantitatively  we estimate our p e ratio by dividing the average stock price over the preceding months the long term p e calculation and the last trading dates the day p e calculation prior to the measurement date by the median estimate of our net income per share for the months starting with the next calendar quarter immediately following the reporting date 
this median earnings estimate is obtained from the institutional brokers estimate system i b e s 
we then determine the best estimate of our long term price to earnings multiple for valuation purposes by qualitatively evaluating the day p e calculation as compared to the long term p e calculation 
in this evaluation we examine both measures to determine whether differences  if any  are the result of a fundamental change in our long term value or the result of short term market volatility or other non company specific market factors that may not be indicative of our long term forward p e 
we believe  given the perpetual nature of the put option  that a market participant would more heavily weight long term value indicators  as opposed to short term indicators 
factors that might indicate a fundamental change in long term value include  but are not limited to  changes in the regulatory environment  client portfolio  long term growth rates or new product innovation 
a consistent methodology is applied to a group of comparable public companies used to estimate the forward price to earnings multiple applicable to visa europe 
these estimates  therefore  are impacted by changes in stock prices and the financial market s expectations of our future earnings and those of the comparable companies 
other estimates of lesser significance include growth rates and foreign currency exchange rates applied in the calculation of visa europe s adjusted sustainable income 
the valuation model assumes a large range of annual growth rates  reflecting the different economic environments and circumstances under which visa europe could decide to exercise 
the lowest growth rates assumed reflect visa europe s current business model as an association  owned by its member banks  while the highest reflect a successful shift to a for profit model in anticipation of exercise 
the scenarios with higher growth rates are assigned a significantly higher probability in the valuation model  as we believe a market participant would more heavily weight these scenarios as it is likely that  should it choose to exercise its option  visa europe will seek to maximize the purchase price by adopting a for profit business model in advance of exercising the put option 
the foreign exchange rate used to translate visa europe s results from euros to us dollars reflects a blend of forward exchange rates observed in the marketplace 
the assumed timing of exercise of the put option used in the various modeled scenarios is not an overly significant assumption in the valuation  as obligations calculated in later years are more heavily discounted in the calculation of present value 
impact if actual results differ from assumptions 
in the determination of the fair value of the put option at september   we have assumed a probability of exercise by visa europe at some point in the future and an estimated long term p e differential at the time of exercise of approximately x 
the use of a probability of exercise that is higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately million in the value of the put option 
an increase of x in the assumed p e differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately million in the value of the put option 
the put option is exercisable at any time at the sole discretion of visa europe 
as such  the put option liability is included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at september  classification in current liabilities is not an indication of management s expectation of exercise and simply reflects the fact that this obligation could become payable within months 
legal and regulatory matters critical estimates 
we are currently involved in various legal proceedings  the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time 
management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss  if any  in preparing our financial statements 
assumptions and judgment 
we evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party 
we record a liability for such claims when a loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability 
table of contents and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings  the merits of our defenses and consultation with in house and outside legal counsel 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and may revise our estimates 
our retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of  or final judgments in  the covered litigation 
the plan s mechanisms include the use of the litigation escrow account 
the accrual related to the covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the litigation escrow account balance 
we recorded an additional accrual of billion for the covered litigation during fiscal see note retrospective responsibility plan and note legal matters to our consolidated financial statements 
impact if actual results differ from assumptions 
due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate  our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes  which could have material adverse effects on our business  financial conditions and results of operations 
see note legal matters to our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes critical estimates 
in calculating our effective tax rate  we make judgments regarding certain tax positions  including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions 
assumptions and judgment 
we have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits  the establishment of liabilities for uncertain tax positions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
we are also required to inventory  evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained  or may only be partially sustained  upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities 
impact if actual results differ from assumptions 
although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable  actual results may differ from these estimates 
some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities 
if one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded  and we were unable to realize this benefit  it could have a material and adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors 
our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and equity prices 
aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis 
foreign currency exchange rate risk although most of our activities are transacted in us dollars  we are exposed to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are primarily related to adverse changes in the us dollar value of revenues generated from foreign currency denominated transactions and adverse changes in the us dollar value of payments in foreign currencies  primarily for expenses at our non us locations 
we manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts that hedge exposures of the variability in the us dollar equivalent of anticipated non us dollar denominated cash flows 
our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces  but does not entirely eliminate  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
the aggregate notional amounts of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program were million and million at september  and  respectively 
the aggregate notional amount of million outstanding at september   is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below a predetermined and approved threshold 
however  actual results could materially differ from our forecast 
the effect of a hypothetical change of the us dollar is estimated to create an additional fair value gain or loss of approximately million on our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at september  see note derivative financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements 
we are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities 
this risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with clients relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency 
table of contents positions 
risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures  including the utilization of visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties 
interest rate risk our investment portfolio assets are held in both fixed rate and adjustable rate securities 
these assets are included in cash equivalents  short term available for sale investments and long term available for sale investments 
investments in fixed rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
the fair value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates 
additionally  a falling rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature  the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate  generating less interest income 
historically  we have been able to hold investments until maturity 
our operating results or cash flows have not been  and are not expected to be  materially impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates 
the fair value balances of our fixed rate investment securities at september  and were billion and billion  respectively 
a hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would create an estimated change in fair value of approximately million on our fixed rate investment securities at september  the fair value balances of our adjustable rate debt securities were million and million at september  and  respectively 
visa europe put option we have a liability related to the put option with visa europe which is recorded at fair value at september  we are required to record any change in the fair value of the put option on a quarterly basis 
in the determination of the fair value of the put option at september   we have assumed a probability of exercise by visa europe at some point in the future and a p e differential  at the time of exercise  of approximately x 
the use of a probability of exercise higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately million in the value of the put option 
an increase of x in the assumed p e differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately million in the value of the put option 
see liquidity and capital resources and critical accounting estimates above 
pension plan risk our us defined benefit pension plan assets were million and million and projected benefit obligations were million and million at september  and  respectively 
a material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets and or the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the plan  an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding 
we will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan assets and market conditions as we evaluate the amount of our contribution to the plan for fiscal  which we expect to make in september
