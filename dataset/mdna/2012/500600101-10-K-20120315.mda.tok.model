item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including the risks discussed in item a risk factors  and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition under the percentage of completion method  bad debts  inventories  warranty reserves  investment valuations  valuation of stock compensation awards  recoverability of deferred tax assets  liabilities for uncertain tax positions and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are most affected by our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenue if four basic criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and services rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we do not recognize revenue for products prior to customer acceptance unless we believe the product meets all customer specifications and has a history of consistently achieving customer acceptance of the product 
provisions for product returns and allowances are recorded in the same period as the related revenues 
we analyze historical returns  current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of product when evaluating the adequacy of sales returns and other allowances 
certain product sales are made to distributors under agreements allowing for a limited right of return on unsold products 
sales to distributors are primarily made for sales to the distributors customers and not for stocking of inventory 
we delay revenue recognition for our estimate of distributor claims of right of return on unsold products based upon our historical experience with our products and specific analysis of amounts subject to return based upon discussions with our distributors or their customers 
we recognize revenues from long term research and development contracts on the percentage of completion method of accounting as work is performed  based upon the ratio of costs or hours already incurred to the estimated total cost of completion or hours of work to be performed 
revenue recognized at any point in time is limited to the amount funded by the us government or contracting entity 
we account for product development and research contracts that have established prices for distinct phases as if each phase were a separate contract 
in some instances  we are contracted to create a deliverable which is anticipated to go into full production 
in those cases  we discontinue the percentage of completion method after formal qualification of the deliverable has been completed and revenue is then recognized based on the criteria established for sale of products 
in certain instances qualification may be achieved and delivery of production units may commence however our customer may have either identified new issues to be resolved or wish to incorporate a newer display technology 
in these circumstances new units delivered will continue to be accounted for under the criteria established for sale of products 
we classify amounts earned on contracts in progress that are in excess of amounts billed as unbilled receivables and we classify amounts received in excess of amounts earned as billings in excess of revenues earned 
we invoice based on dates specified in the related agreement or in periodic installments based upon our invoicing cycle 
we recognize the entire amount of an estimated ultimate loss in our financial statements at the time the loss on a contract becomes known 
accounting for design  development and production contracts requires judgment relative to assessing risks  estimating contract revenues and costs  and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues 
due to the size and nature of the work required to be performed on many of our contracts  the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables 
contract costs include material  labor and subcontracting costs  as well as an allocation of indirect costs 
we have to make assumptions regarding the number of labor hours required to complete a task  the complexity of the work to be performed  the availability and cost of materials  and performance by our subcontractors 
for contract change orders  claims or similar items  we apply judgment in estimating the amounts and assessing the potential for realization 
these amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable 
we have accounting policies in place to address these as well as other contractual and business arrangements to properly account for long term contracts 
if our estimate of total contract costs or our determination of whether the customer agrees that a milestone is achieved is incorrect  our revenue could be overstated and profits would be negatively impacted 
bad debt we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this estimate is based on an analysis of specific customer creditworthiness and historical bad debts experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make future payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory we provide a reserve for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventory based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions and our production plans 
inventories that are obsolete or slow moving are generally fully reserved representing the estimated net realizable value as such information becomes available 
our iii v products are made to each customer s unique specifications and are generally produced upon receipt of a customer order 
the manufacturing time to make our iii v products is less than one day  accordingly our iii v inventory consists primarily of raw material  primarily gallium arsenide wafers  or finished products 
the finished product may be at our facilities or at our customer s facilities under consignment programs 
our display products are manufactured based upon production plans whose critical assumptions include non binding demand forecasts provided by our customers  lead times for raw materials  lead times for wafer foundries to perform circuit processing and yields 
if a customer were to cancel an order or actual demand was lower than forecasted demand  we could not sell the excess iii v inventory and we may not be able to sell the excess display inventory and additional reserves would be required 
if we were unable to sell the excess inventory  we would establish reserves to reduce the inventory to its estimated realizable value generally zero 
investment valuation at december  we held minority investments in advance wireless semiconductor company awsc and win semiconductor corp 
win  publicly traded companies on the taiwan stock exchange whose share prices have been  and may continue to be  highly volatile 
we consider these investments to be available for sale and accordingly account for fluctuations in the value of these investments in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the fair market values of awsc and win were million and million  respectively  at december  we periodically make equity investments in private companies  accounted for on the cost or equity method  whose values are difficult to determine 
when assessing investments in private companies for an other than temporary decline in value  we consider such factors as  among other things  the share price from the investee s latest financing round  the performance of the investee in relation to its own operating targets and its business plan  the investee s revenue and cost trends  the liquidity and cash position  including its cash burn rate and market acceptance of the investee s products and services 
because these are private companies which we do not control we may not be able to obtain all of the information we would want in order to make a complete assessment of the investment on a timely basis 
accordingly  our estimates may be revised if other information becomes available at a later date 
in addition to the above we make investments in government and agency backed securities and corporate debt securities 
for all of our investments we provide for an impairment valuation if we believe a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary  which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
the determination of whether a decline in value is other than temporary requires that we estimate the cash flows we expect to receive from the security 
we use publicly available information such as credit ratings and financial information of the entity that issued the security in the development of our expectation of the cash flows to be received 
historically  we have periodically recorded other than temporary impairment losses 
product warranty we generally sell products with a limited warranty of product quality and a limited indemnification of customers against intellectual property infringement claims related to our products 
we accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
as of december   we had a warranty reserve of million  which represents the estimated liabilities for warranty claims in process  potential warranty issues customers have notified us about and an estimate based on historical failure rates 
for the fiscal years  and  our warranty claims and reversals were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
if our estimates for warranty claims are incorrect  our profits would be impacted 
income taxes we have historically incurred domestic operating losses from both a financial reporting and tax return standpoint 
we establish valuation allowances if it appears more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
these judgments are based on our projections of taxable income and the amount and timing of our tax operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets 
given our federal operating tax loss carryforwards  we do not expect to pay domestic federal taxes in the near term 
it is possible that we could pay domestic alternative minimum taxes and state income taxes 
we are also subject to foreign taxes from our korean  taiwanese and uk subsidiary operations 
our income tax provision is based on calculations and assumptions that will be subject to examination by tax authorities 
despite our history of operating losses there can be exposures for state taxes  federal alternative minimum taxes or foreign tax that may be due 
we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
should the actual results differ from our estimates  we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
such adjustment could have a material impact on our results of operations 
we have historically established valuation allowances against all of our net deferred tax assets because of our history of generating operating losses and restrictions on the use of certain items 
our evaluation of the recoverability of deferred tax assets has also included analysis of the expiration dates of net operating loss carryforwards 
in forming our conclusions as to whether the deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized we consider the sources of our income and the projected stability of those sources and product life cycles 
over the last three fiscal years a significant component of our income has been derived from sales of higher margin military products to the us government 
if the us government significantly reduces funding for these programs we will not be profitable 
in assessing our ability to realize our domestic deferred tax assets in the future  we consider the potential impact of the us government s federal budget deficit on both the us military programs in which we currently participate and those programs in which we anticipate participating in the future 
a similar analysis is performed with respect to our foreign subsidiaries 
stock compensation there were no stock options granted in fiscal years  or the fair value of nonvested restricted common stock awards is generally the market value of the company s equity shares on the date of grant 
the nonvested common stock awards require the employee to fulfill certain obligations  including remaining employed by the company for one  two or four years the vesting period and in certain cases meeting performance criteria 
the performance criteria primarily consist of the achievement of the company s annual incentive plan goals 
for nonvested restricted common stock awards which solely require the recipient to remain employed with the company  the stock compensation expense is amortized over the anticipated service period 
for nonvested restricted common stock awards which require the achievement of performance criteria  the company reviews the probability of achieving the performance goals on a periodic basis 
if the company determines that it is probable that the performance criteria will be achieved  the amount of compensation cost derived for the performance goal is amortized over the service period 
if the performance criteria are not met  no compensation cost is recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed 
the company recognizes compensation costs on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for time vested awards 
we have an award to the ceo which vests upon our stock price achieving a certain price for consecutive business days 
the compensation expense associated with this award is recognized over the derived service period 
results of operations we are a leading developer and manufacturer of advanced semiconductor materials and miniature displays 
we use our proprietary semiconductor material technology to design  manufacture and market our iii v and cyberdisplay products for use in highly demanding commercial wireless communications and high resolution portable military  industrial and consumer electronic applications 
our products enable our customers to develop and market an improved generation of products for these target applications 
we have two principal sources of revenues product revenues and research and development revenues 
product revenues consist of sales of our iii v products  principally gallium arsenide gaas hbt transistor wafers  and cyberdisplay products 
research and development revenues consist primarily of development contracts with agencies or prime contractors of the us government 
research and development revenues were million  or of total revenues  million  or of total revenues and million  or of total revenues in our iii v products are manufactured by us in our manufacturing facilities in taunton  massachusetts  usa and kopin taiwan corporation ktc  our taiwanese subsidiary and one of our reportable segments 
our cyberdisplay products are transmissive microdisplays and the initial manufacturing steps are performed in our westborough  massachusetts  usa facility and then the back end packaging steps for commercial transmissive display products is performed at our korean subsidiary  kowon  which is also one of our reportable segments 
forth dimension displays fdd manufactures reflective microdisplays in its facility located in scotland and it too is a reportable segment 
because our fiscal year ends on the last saturday of december every seven years we have a fiscal year with weeks 
our fiscal year was a week year as compared to fiscal years and which were both week years 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
our revenues  which include product sales and amounts earned from research and development contracts  for fiscal years and  were as follows in millions revenues iii v display total the increase in our iii v revenues resulted from an increase in demand for our products  specifically hbt transistors  from customers that use our products in the production of components sold to makers of wireless handsets 
we believe this increase in demand was the result of both an increase in the number of wireless handsets that were sold over the prior year and because the percentage of g or smartphones  which is a more technologically advanced type of wireless handset  increased over the prior year as a percentage of the total wireless handsets sold 
g and smart phones offer more functions  for example web browsing  than a standard wireless handset 
g and smart phones require more hbt transistors than a standard wireless handset to support the increased functionality 
we believe the increase in industry sales of g and smart phones will continue in in july  our purchase and supply agreement with our largest iii v customer  a customer which represented of our revenues  expires see item a  risk factors for explanation of percent of revenue calculation  subject to a last time buy option 
if we do not renew this agreement or increase hbt sales to other customers our sales may decline 
display revenues for and were as follows display revenues by category in millions military applications consumer electronic applications eyewear applications research development total sales of our products for military applications declined in because of reduced demand from the us government 
based on recently proposed federal budgets and discussions with our customers  we expect our revenues from sales of defense related products to the us government to decline approximately million in our fiscal year 
our military products have higher profit margins than our other display products and have been a significant contributor to our overall profitability for the pasts several years 
the us government is projected to incur large budget deficits for the near future and is expected to reduce spending on military programs as part of the solution to decrease these deficits 
in addition an anticipated overall decline in military spending our military revenues may also decline because of a change in the us government procurement process 
we have been supplying our display products in support of a us government thermal weapon sight program 
under this program we have had three customers 
we have been notified that the us government will most likely chose only one of the three to be the supplier for the program in the future 
we sell different products to each of the three customers 
the range of products consists of a single display to a module 
the single display sells for approximately as compared to the module which sells for more than  depending on who the us government awards the contract to support the thermal weapon sight program our revenues may be affected 
we have been the sole supplier of displays to the us military for several of its thermal weapon sight programs 
we believe the us military will evaluate competitors products for the next thermal weapon sight program 
this could result in our receiving a lower percentage of these total programs than we historically have and while we do not believe it is probable  it is possible we may not receive any award 
as a result of the factors above we anticipate a reduction in revenues from the sale of our military products in the increase in the consumer electronic applications category is the result of an increase in sales of our products for digital still cameras 
our ability to forecast our revenues in this category is very difficult as sales of our product ultimately depend on how successful our customers are in promoting their digital still cameras models 
there are many digital still camera models offered by a number of large consumer electronic companies and it is a very competitive product category 
in addition we typically rebid to win this business each year 
the customers for our eyewear products tend to be smaller companies and the economic down turn during the recent years has affected their ability to obtain credit with which to purchase our products 
the increase in research and development revenues is the result of an increase in funding from the us government 
we are unable to predict the amount of funding for research and development by the us government as it addresses its fiscal deficit issues 
in  we began offering a headworn  hands free cloud computing product that has an optical pod with a microdisplay which we refer to as golden i 
sales of golden i in were diminimis and were primarily to demonstrate the product concept 
we have entered into an agreement to license the golden i technology and know how to a company that is developing an industrialized product which they anticipate offering in the license is exclusive for the industrial market  non exclusive for certain other markets and prohibits sales to other markets 
under the terms of the license we will sell an optical pod which includes our display  optics and a back light 
we do not believe revenue will be significant in from sales of these products but we do believe in successive years products such as this will be important for our revenue growth and ability to maintain profitability 
this is the first product that we have developed that has a significant software component 
there are a number of different display technologies which can produce displays in small form factors 
we believe one of the benefits of our display technology is the ability to produce high resolution displays in small form factors 
the digital still camera market is mature and the majority of these devices use low resolution display products which results in our having limited  if any  competitive advantage over our competitors and  therefore  the ability to sell displays into these markets is very price dependent 
accordingly for us to maintain or increase display revenues with above average gross margins  we will need to increase sales to customers who buy our higher resolution display products  such as the military  or develop new categories  such as our golden i product 
we also anticipate  based on current discussions with our customers and certain contractual obligations that the prices of certain of our products will decline in fiscal year we anticipate the average selling price of our hbt transistor wafers and display products sold to customers for consumer electronics applications will decline approximately to during fiscal year relative to we expect sales prices of our display products for military applications to remain relatively flat for as compared to the overall increase or decrease in the average sales price of our display products will be dependent on the sales mix of commercial and military displays 
we currently expect revenue of between million and million for fiscal year  however due to the current worldwide economic situation our ability to forecast revenues and results of operations is very limited 
our forecasts are based on our discussions with customers and our expectations about the future global economy and are not based on firm non cancellable orders 
international sales represented and of product revenues for fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in international sales is primarily attributable to an increase in sales of our cyberdisplay products for digital still cameras and iii v products to customers who sell components to manufacturers of wireless handsets 
we expect our revenues will primarily be from customers located in the us international sales are primarily sales of cyberdisplay products to consumer electronic manufacturers located in japan  korea and china 
our international sales are primarily denominated in us currency 
consequently  a strengthening of the us dollar could increase the price in local currencies of our products in foreign markets and make our products relatively more expensive than competitors products that are denominated in local currencies  leading to a reduction in sales or profitability in those foreign markets 
in addition  sales of our cyberdisplay products in korea are transacted through our korean subsidiary  kowon technology co  ltd 
kowon s sales are primarily denominated in us dollars 
however  kowon s local operating costs are primarily denominated in korean won 
kowon also holds us dollars in order to pay various expenses 
as a result  our financial position and results of operations are subject to exchange rate fluctuation in transactional and functional currency 
we have not taken any protective measures against exchange rate fluctuations  such as purchasing hedging instruments with respect to such fluctuations  because of the historically stable exchange rate between the japanese yen  korean won and the us dollar 
cost of product revenues 
cost of product revenues in millions cost of product revenues as a of revenues cost of product revenues  which is comprised of materials  labor and manufacturing overhead related to the production of our products remained relatively consistent from to as a percentage of revenues 
our gross margin is affected by increases or decreases in the sales prices of our products  changes in raw material prices  unit volume of sales  manufacturing efficiencies and the mix of products sold 
as discussed above our sales prices historically decline on an annual basis 
our overhead costs and  to a lesser extent  our labor costs are normally stable and do not fluctuate significantly during any twelve month period 
essentially  we consider labor and overhead costs to be fixed in nature over the short term and therefore profitability is very dependent on the sales prices of our products and the volume of sales 
gross margins  as a percentage of sales  increased from to because of the increase in sales in by ktc and fdd  which have higher gross margins as a percentage than our consolidated gross margin percentage 
for  we anticipate sale prices of display products for military applications to remain stable and sales prices of our iii v products for wireless handset applications and our displays products for consumer electronic applications to decline 
as a result  in order for us to increase gross margins we need to increase manufacturing efficiencies and or increase the unit volume of sales 
research and development 
research and development r d expenses are incurred in support of internal display and iii v product development programs or programs funded by agencies or prime contractors of the us government and commercial partners 
r d revenues associated with funded programs are presented separately in revenue in the statement of operations 
research and development costs include staffing  purchases of materials and laboratory supplies  circuit design costs  fabrication and packaging of display products  and overhead 
for fiscal years and r d expense was as follows in millions research and development expense funded internal total r d expense increased in as compared to the prior year primarily because of increases in costs to develop iii v products for use in g and smartphones and a new head worn hands free cloud computing display product 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative s  g a expenses consist of the expenses incurred by our sales and marketing personnel and related expenses  and administrative and general corporate expenses 
selling  general and administrative expense in millions selling  general and administrative expense as a of revenues the increase in s  g a expenses in as compared to is primarily attributable to the addition of fdd in and a million credit in due to the receipt of insurance proceeds 
we acquired fdd in january of and its s  g  a expense for was million 
the compensation committee of the company approved the following issuances of restricted stock date of issuance number of shares issued september february april december april we issue restricted stock awards to either current employees as part of our annual incentive plan incentive equity awards or to current or prospective employees to remain with us or join us for at least a certain period of time retention equity awards 
the number of shares of our common stock that an employee will ultimately receive and the compensation expense that we will ultimately recognize under an incentive equity award is based on achieving certain financial milestones and or remaining with the company for a specific period of time 
in the case of retention equity awards shares earned are solely a function of time employed 
we filed a proxy statement on march  describing our equity incentive plan  and we have also filed on behalf of certain officers and directors form s with the securities and exchange commission which detail the conditions under which our officers can earn the restricted stock awards 
the proxy statement and form s are available on our website www 
kopin 
com 
in addition  as part of our board of director compensation in fiscal years and  we issued a total of  shares of restricted stock each year to our board members representing annual grants for fiscal years and the equity awards to the board of directors vest per year over the four years following the grant 
in connection with the issuance of the awards above  we recorded stock compensation expenses of million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
impairment 
on january   we purchased of the outstanding common stock of fdd for approximately million plus contingent consideration 
in accounting for the acquisition of fdd  we allocated million to identifiable intangible assets and million to goodwill 
the allocations were based on estimated cash flows as of the acquisition date 
subsequent to the acquisition date and during fiscal the actual operating results and cash flows generated by fdd were less than originally forecasted and at year end using revised forecasts we performed our annual review of intangible assets and goodwill 
as a result of this review we recorded a non cash charge of million to write down the carrying value of the intangible assets and the goodwill to its implied fair market value based on projected discounted cash flows 
the impairment of goodwill represented a decrease in its recorded value 
fdd produces a very high resolution micro display for niche markets 
the majority of its current and forecasted revenues are derived from a small group of customers less than 
in addition approximately of fdd s forecasted sales over the next years are dependent on relatively new customers 
if fdd loses any of its significant customers  or the products which it is projecting to provide significant revenue in the future fail to meet expectations and are not complimented by other revenue sources  additional impairment charges may be necessary 
the below table reports the activity during the year ended december  intangible assets goodwill assets acquired with acquisition of fdd at jan

for  we recorded of foreign currency gains losses as compared to million of foreign currency losses for this was primarily attributable to decreased fluctuations in the us dollar and korean won currency exchange rate 
other income and expense  net for also includes expense of million to record an impairment of certain marketable debt securities which were deemed other than temporarily impaired 
as our marketable debt securities have matured we have been reinvesting in securities which  due to current interest rates  have lower yields than the securities which matured  accordingly we anticipate that our interest income will decline in we have entered into agreements to sell certain patents which we were not using and that had a carrying value of the total consideration the company receives for the sale of the patents is a percentage of any sublicense fees  after expenses  the buyer receives 
in and we sold certain additional patents we were no longer using for million and million  respectively 
there is no additional consideration to be received for the patents sold 
we continue to evaluate the patents in our portfolio for opportunities to monetize these assets 
equity losses in unconsolidated affiliates 
our equity losses in unconsolidated affiliates consists of our approximate share of the losses of kobrite totaling million in and our approximate share of the losses of kobrite totaling million in tax benefit provision 
the benefit provision for income taxes for the fiscal years ended and represent alternative minimum taxes owed to us federal and state taxing authorities of million and million  respectively  offset by the release of a million valuation allowance which had been recorded against the deferred tax assets of ktc 
based on ktc s results of operations for and its projected future results of operations  we concluded that the valuation allowance was not required 
for we expect to have taxes based on us federal tax liabilities based on federal alternative minimum tax rules and on our foreign operations 
we also expect to have a state tax provision in taiwan tax law requires a tax on unappropriated earnings of our subsidiary  ktc 
we recorded million for this liability as of december  net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interest 
we own approximately of the equity of kowon and of the equity of ktc 
net income loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest on the consolidated statement of operations represents the portion of the results of operations of kowon and ktc which are allocated to the shareholders of the approximately of kowon and of ktc not owned by us 
the change in the net income loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest of our subsidiaries is as follows in millions kowon ktc total fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
our revenues  which include product sales and amounts earned from research and development contracts  for fiscal years and were as follows in millions revenues iii v cyberdisplay total the increase in our iii v revenues resulted from an increase in demand for our products  specifically hbt transistors  from customers that use our products in the production of components sold to makers of wireless handsets 
we believe this increase in demand was the result of both an increase in the number of wireless handsets that were sold over the prior year and because the percentage of g or smartphones  which is a more technologically advanced type of wireless handset  increased over the prior year as a percentage of the total wireless handsets sold 
g and smart phones offer more functions  for example web browsing  than a standard wireless handset 
g and smart phones require more hbt transistors than a standard wireless handset to support the increased functionality 
display revenues for and were as follows display revenues by category in millions military applications consumer electronic applications eyewear applications research development total sales of our products for military applications declined in because of reduced demand from the us government 
the us government is projected to incur large budget deficits for the near future and is expected to reduce spending on military programs as part of the solution to decrease these deficits 
as a result of this anticipated reduction in military spending demand for our military products may decline 
our military products have higher profit margins than our other display products 
the increase in the consumer electronic applications category is the result of an increase in sales of our products for digital still cameras 
our ability to forecast our revenues in this category is very difficult as sales of our product ultimately depend on how successful our customers are in promoting their digital still cameras models

the customers for our eyewear products tend to be smaller companies and the economic down turn in and affected their ability to obtain credit with which to purchase our products 
the increase in sale of our products in to customers that use them for eyewear products is the result of a few of these customers being able to obtain financing in we believe that some of the increase is from these customers refilling their inventory as well as for meeting current demand 
the decline in research and development revenues is the result of a decline in funding from the us government 
we believe the amount of funding for research and development which is funded by the us government may decline as it addresses its fiscal deficit issues 
in we anticipate offering a head worn  hands free cloud computing product that has an optical pod with a microdisplay 
we do not believe revenue will be significant in from sales of these products but we do believe in successive years products such as this will be important for our revenue growth and ability to maintain profitability 
this is the first product that we have developed that has a significant software component 
we anticipate a business model whereby we will sell the optical pod and license the software 
we have been the sole supplier of displays to the us military for its thermal weapon sight programs  tws  tws ii and currently tws bridge 
we believe the us military will evaluate competitors products for the next thermal weapon sight program  tws iii 
this could result in our receiving a lower percentage of these total programs than we historically have 
there are a number of different display technologies which can produce displays in small form factors 
we believe one of the benefits of our display technology is the ability to produce high resolution displays in small form factors 
the digital still camera market is mature and the majority of these devices use low resolution display products which results in our having limited  if any  competitive advantage over our competitors and  therefore  the ability to sell displays into these markets is very price dependent 
accordingly for us to maintain or increase display revenues with above average gross margins  we will need to increase sales to customers who buy our higher resolution display products  such as the military  or develop new categories  such as eyewear 
we also anticipate  based on current discussions with our customers and certain contractual obligations that the prices of certain of our products will decline in fiscal year we anticipate the average selling price of our hbt transistor wafers and display products sold to customers for consumer electronics applications will decline approximately during fiscal year relative to we expect sales prices of our display products for military applications to remain relatively flat for as compared to the overall increase or decrease in the average sales price of our display products will be dependent on the sales mix of commercial and military display sales

the decrease in bad debts expense was not a true increase per se but rather in there was a credit in bad debt expense as a result of a reversal of million allowance for doubtful accounts established at december  for the possible uncollectible receivables from ktc 
this allowance was reversed when we acquired control of ktc in the third quarter of the reduction in professional fees was the result of insurance proceeds which reimbursed the company for expenses previously incurred in dealing with certain legal actions

we issue restricted stock awards either as part of our annual incentive plan incentive equity awards or to induce a prospective employee to join us or current employee to remain with us for at least a certain period of time retention equity awards 
the number of shares of our common stock that an employee will ultimately receive and the compensation expense that we will ultimately recognize under an incentive equity award is based on achieving certain financial milestones and remaining with the company for a specific period of time 
in the case of retention equity awards shares earned are solely a function of time employed 
we filed a proxy statement on march  describing our equity incentive plan  and we have also filed on behalf of certain officers and directors form s with the securities and exchange commission which detail the conditions under our officers can earn the restricted stock awards

subsequent to the release we reclassified million from other income and expense  net  to income from operations 
as our marketable debt securities have matured we have been reinvesting in securities which  due to current interest rates  have lower yields than the securities which matured  accordingly we anticipate that our interest income will decline in in conjunction with our obtaining a controlling interest in ktc in we recorded a gain of million for the remeasurement of our investment in ktc to fair market value and million related to the repayment of loans from ktc which had been previously written off 
a more complete explanation of the impact on our financial statements from our obtaining a controlling interest in ktc is below 
in fiscal year we entered into an agreement to sell certain patents which we were not using and that had a carrying value of to a buyer who would attempt to sublicense the patents 
the total consideration the company would receive for the sale of the patents would be a percentage of any sublicense fees  after expenses  the buyer received

the increase in capital expenditures is primarily the result of our investments in capacity for our iii v product line in response to customer demand 
cash and marketable debt securities held in us dollars domestic foreign subtotal cash and marketable debt securities cash and marketable debt securities held in other currencies and converted to us dollars total cash and marketable debt securities we have no plans to repatriate the foreign cash and marketable debt securities such that we have not recorded any deferred tax liability

included in the  of billings in excess of revenue earned on the consolidated balance sheet at december  is approximately million which we received from the state of massachusetts as an incentive to retain jobs in massachusetts 
we earn amounts under the agreement by meeting certain employment milestones each year and amounts not earned will be repaid to the state of massachusetts at the end of the agreement in the agreement also contains repayment provisions which require us to repay certain amounts back to the state of massachusetts if we fail to achieve certain employment milestones after years three and five of the agreement  or if we move certain parts of our operations out of the state

under the terms of this agreement we have agreed to maintain capacity levels for manufacturing hbt wafers and we committed to a pricing schedule under certain circumstances

in consideration for this agreement the customer agreed to source a certain percentage of its hbt wafer needs from us subject to the customer s right to source hbt wafers from other sources if we are unable to meet their requirements under certain circumstances 
we agreed that failure to meet our supply obligations under the agreement would allow our customer to obtain court ordered specific performance and if we do not perform we could then be liable for monetary damages up to a maximum of million 
we lease facilities located in taunton and westborough  massachusetts  and scotts valley  california  under non cancelable operating leases 
we have two taunton facilities  one whose lease expires in and the other in the taunton lease which expires in may be extended for a year term 
the westborough lease  which was extended subsequent to december   expires in and the scotts valley lease expires in we also lease a facility in dalgety bay  scotland which expires in april we expect to expend between and million on capital expenditures over the next twelve months  primarily for the acquisition of equipment to increase capacity in our iii v product line 
as of december   we had substantial tax loss carry forwards  which may be used to offset future federal taxes due 
we may record a tax provision in our financial statements but we may be able to offset some or all of the amounts that are payable with our tax loss carry forwards 
we may be subject to alternative minimum taxes  foreign taxes and state income taxes depending on our taxable income and sources of taxable income 
historically we have financed our operations primarily through public and private placements of our equity securities 
over the past several years we have generated sufficient cash from operations to fund the business 
we believe our available cash resources will support our operations and capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
seasonality the markets for our iii v and consumer electronic cyberdisplay products have been traditionally seasonal  with sales of these products strongest in the third quarter followed by our second quarter then our fourth quarter and our first quarter being our lowest sales quarter 
however this seasonal pattern did not exist in fiscal year the timing of new product introductions by our customers may have disrupted the seasonality of our business 
climate change we do not believe there is anything unique to our business which would result in climate change regulations having a disproportional affect on us as compared to us industry overall 
inflation we do not believe our operations have been materially affected by inflation in the last fiscal years 
contractual obligations the following is a summary of our contractual payment obligations for operating leases as of december  contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our excess cash in high quality us government  government backed fannie mae  fdic guaranteed bonds and certificates of deposit and corporate debt instruments  which bear lower levels of relative risk 
we believe that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows should not be material to our cash flows or income 
it is possible that interest rate movements would increase our unrecognized gain or loss on interest rate securities 
included in other assets are equity investments in advanced wireless semiconductor company awsc and win semiconductor corp 
win of approximately million and million  respectively  which are subject to changes in value because of either specific operating issues or overall changes in the stock market 
we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily through our translation of our foreign subsidiary s financial positions  results of operations  and transaction gains and losses as a result of non us dollar denominated cash flows related to business activities in asia  and remeasurement of united states dollars to the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries 
we are also exposed to the affects of exchange rates in the purchase of certain raw materials whose price is in us dollars but the price on future purchases is subject to change based on the relationship of the japanese yen to the us dollar 
we do not currently hedge our foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we estimate that any market risk associated with our international operations is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operation 
our portfolio of marketable debt securities is subject to interest rate risk although our intent is to hold securities until maturity 
the credit rating of our investments may be affected by the underlying financial health of the guarantors of our investments 
we use gallium arsenide and silicon wafers but do not enter into forward or futures hedging contracts
