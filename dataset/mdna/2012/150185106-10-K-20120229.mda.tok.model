item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
business overview we generate our revenues primarily from sales of admission to our parks  food  merchandise and games inside our parks  and hotel rooms  food and other attractions outside our parks 
our principal costs and expenses  which include salaries and wages  advertising  maintenance  operating supplies  utilities and insurance  are relatively fixed and do not vary significantly with attendance 
each of our properties is run by a park general manager and operates autonomously 
management reviews operating results  evaluates performance and makes operating decisions  including the allocation of resources  on a property by property basis 
aside from attendance and guest per capita statistics  discrete financial information and operating results are not prepared at the regional level  but rather at the individual park level for use by the ceo  who is the chief operating decision maker codm  as well as by the chief financial officer  the chief operating officer  the park general managers  and the executive vice president  operations 

table of contents the following table presents certain financial data expressed as a percent of total net revenues and selective statistical information for the periods indicated 
for the years ended december  amounts in millions  except attendance  per capita spending and percentages net revenues admissions food  merchandise and games accommodations and other net revenues operating costs and expenses depreciation and amortization loss on impairment of goodwill and other intangibles loss on impairment retirement of fixed assets gain on sale of other assets operating income interest and other expense  net net effect of swaps loss on early debt extinguishment unrealized realized foreign currency gain loss provision for taxes net income loss other data combined attendance in thousands combined in park guest per capita spending critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions during the normal course of business that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results or involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity see note to our consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies 
application of the critical accounting policies described below involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties  and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost 
expenditures made to maintain such assets in their original operating condition are expensed as incurred  and improvements and upgrades are capitalized 
depreciation is computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the composite method is used for the group of assets acquired as a whole in  as well as for the groups of like assets of each subsequent business acquisition 
the unit method is used for all individual assets purchased 
impairment of long lived assets the carrying values of long lived assets  including property and equipment  are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of the assets may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss may be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets  including disposition  are less than the carrying value of the assets 
the measurement of the impairment loss to be recognized is based on the difference between the fair value and the carrying amounts of the assets 
fair value is generally determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
in order to determine if an asset has been impaired  assets are grouped and tested at the lowest level for which identifiable  independent cash flows are available 

table of contents the determination of both undiscounted and discounted cash flows requires management to make significant estimates and consider an anticipated course of action as of the balance sheet date 
subsequent changes in estimated undiscounted and discounted cash flows arising from changes in anticipated actions could impact the determination of whether impairment exists  the amount of the impairment charge recorded and whether the effects could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
there was no impairment of long lived assets in at the end of the fourth quarter in  we concluded based on operating results  as well as updated forecasts  that a review of the carrying value of long lived assets at california s great america was warranted 
after performing our review  we determined that a portion of the park s fixed assets  the majority of which were originally recorded with the paramount parks ppi acquisition  were impaired 
as a result  we recognized million of fixed asset impairment as of december  goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  including trade names  are reviewed for impairment annually  or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred 
such indicators may include  among others a significant decline in expected future cash flows  a sustained  significant decline in equity price and market capitalization  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  unanticipated competition  the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit  and slower growth rates 
any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
an impairment loss may be recognized if the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its fair value  which is estimated using both an income discounted cash flow and market approach 
the amount of impairment is determined by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded for the difference 
goodwill and trade names have been assigned at the reporting unit  or park level  for purposes of impairment testing 
until december  goodwill related to parks acquired prior to was tested annually for impairment as of october  while goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles  including trade name intangibles  related to the ppi acquisition in were tested annually for impairment as of april effective in december  we changed the date of our annual goodwill impairment tests from april and october to december to more closely align the impairment testing procedures with our long range planning and forecasting process  which occurs in the fourth quarter each year 
we believe the change is preferable since the long term cash flow projections are a key component in performing our annual impairment tests of goodwill 
in addition  we changed the date of our annual impairment test for other indefinite lived intangibles from april to december for  we completed the review of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles as of december  and determined the goodwill was not impaired 
during  we tested goodwill for impairment as of april  or october   as applicable  and again as of december  the tests indicated no impairment of goodwill as of any of those dates 
other indefinite lived intangibles were tested for impairment as of april  and december  after performing the april  impairment test  we determined that a portion of trade names at certain ppi parks were impaired as the carrying values of those trade names exceeded their fair values 
as a result we recognized million of trade name impairment during the second quarter of this impairment was driven mainly by an increase in our cost of capital in and lower projected growth rates for certain parks as of the test date 
after performing the december  impairment test  we determined that a portion of the trade names at great america  originally recorded with the ppi acquisition  were impaired 
as a result  we recognized an additional million of trade name impairment during the fourth quarter of the change in accounting principle related to changing the annual goodwill impairment testing date did not delay  accelerate  avoid or cause an impairment charge 
as it was impracticable to objectively determine operating and valuation estimates for periods prior to december   we have prospectively applied the change in the annual goodwill impairment testing date from december  it is possible that our assumptions about future performance  as well as the economic outlook and related conclusions regarding the valuation of our reporting units parks  could change adversely  which may result in additional impairment that would have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations in future periods 
at december   all three of our reporting units had fair values in excess of their carrying values by greater than 
self insurance reserves reserves are recorded for the estimated amounts of guest and employee claims and expenses incurred each period that are not covered by insurance 
reserves are established for both identified claims and incurred but not reported ibnr claims 
such amounts are accrued for when claim amounts become probable and estimable 
reserves for identified claims are based upon our own historical claims experience and third party estimates of settlement costs 
reserves for ibnr claims  which are not material to our consolidated financial statements  are based upon our own claims data history  as well as industry averages 
all reserves are periodically reviewed for changes in facts and circumstances and adjustments are made as necessary 

table of contents derivative financial instruments derivative financial instruments are only used within our overall risk management program to manage certain interest rate and foreign currency risks from time to time 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
derivative financial instruments used in hedging transactions are assessed both at inception and quarterly thereafter to ensure they are effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the related underlying exposures 
for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges  the effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income loss and reclassified into earnings in the period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
changes in fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify as effective hedging activities are reported as net effect of swaps in the consolidated statement of operations 
additionally  the accumulated other comprehensive income loss related to interest rate swaps that become ineffective is amortized over the remaining life of the interest rate swap  and reported as a component of net effect of swaps in the consolidated statements of operations 
revenue recognition revenues on multi day admission tickets are recognized over the estimated number of visits expected for each type of ticket  and are adjusted periodically during the season 
all other revenues are recognized on a daily basis based on actual guest spending at our facilities  or over the park operating season in the case of certain marina revenues and certain sponsorship revenues 
revenues on admission tickets for the next operating season  including season passes  are deferred in the year received and recognized as revenue in the following year 
income taxes the partnership s legal structure includes both partnerships and corporate subsidiaries 
as a publicly traded partnership  the partnership is subject to an entity level tax the ptp tax 
accordingly  the partnership itself is not subject to corporate income taxes  rather  the partnership s tax attributes except those of the corporate subsidiaries are included in the tax returns of its partners 
the partnership s corporate subsidiaries are subject to entity level income taxes 
the partnership s provision for taxes includes both the ptp tax and the income taxes from the corporate subsidiaries 
the partnership s corporate subsidiaries account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
accordingly  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future book and tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using enacted tax rate expected to apply in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the partnership records a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion  or all  of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
through december   the partnership had recorded a million valuation allowance related to the deferred tax asset for foreign tax credit carryforwards 
the need for this allowance was based on several factors including the accumulated federal net operating loss carryforward  the ten year carryforward period allowed for excess foreign tax credits  experience to date of foreign tax credit limitations  and management s long term estimates of domestic and foreign source income 
during  we claimed a refund for foreign taxes paid in previous years 
the recovery of prior year taxes resulted in a redetermination of the foreign tax credit carryforwards and a million reduction in the valuation allowance related to these carryforwards 
also during  we began to utilize the federal tax net operating loss carryforward and updated our long term estimates of domestic and foreign source income 
based on these updated estimates  we believe a release of a portion of the valuation allowance was warranted 
we recorded a partial release of valuation allowance of million during the fourth quarter of based on our projected foreign tax credit utilization 
the total valuation allowance reduction results in a million tax benefit in as of december   we had million of deferred tax assets associated with the foreign tax credit carryforwards and a million related valuation allowance 
there is inherent uncertainty in the estimates used to project the amount of foreign tax credit carryforwards that are more likely than not to be realized 
it is possible that our future income projections  as well as the economic outlook and related conclusions regarding the valuation allowance could change  which may result in additional valuation allowance being recorded or may result in additional valuation allowance reductions  which may have a material negative or positive effect on our reported financial position and results of operations in future periods 

table of contents results of operations vs 
the following table presents key operating and financial information for the years ended december  and amounts in thousands  except per capita spending and percentages 
increase decrease net revenues operating costs and expenses depreciation and amortization loss on impairment of goodwill and other intangibles n m loss on impairment retirement of fixed assets n m operating income other data adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin attendance per capita spending out of park revenues n m not meaningful consolidated net revenues totaled  million in  increasing million  from million in the increase in revenues reflects a  or million visit  increase in attendance from a year ago and a  or  increase in average in park guest per capita spending for the year 
in park guest per capita spending represents the amount spent per attendee to gain admission to a park  plus all amounts spent while inside the park gates 
the improved attendance for compared to is largely due to increases in season passes sold and season pass visits 
the growth in season pass visits was the result of an increased marketing focus toward season passes at several of our parks  resulting in a significant increase in the number of season passes sold 
the increase in revenues also reflects an increase of  or approximately million  in out of park revenues  which represents the sale of hotel rooms  food  merchandise and other complementary activities located outside of the park gates 
the increase in out of park revenues was primarily driven by an increase in occupancy and average daily room rates at most of our hotel properties 
the increase in revenues for the fiscal year also reflects the impact of currency exchange rates and the weakening us dollar on our canadian operations approximately million during operating costs and expenses increased million  or  to million versus million for and were in line with expectations 
the increase in costs and expenses was the result of a million increase in cost of goods sold  a million increase in operating expenses  and a increase in selling  general and administrative costs 
the increase in operating expenses is primarily attributable to higher wages of million  million of higher maintenance costs and million of higher operating supply costs 
the cost of operating supplies has trended up primarily as a result of higher attendance 
the increase in wages is largely due to increased season labor hours as a result of expanded operating hours at several parks  additional attractions and guest services  and the overall effect of increased attendance 
the increase in selling  general and administrative costs reflects the impact of million of non recurring costs incurred in  including litigation expenses and costs for sec compliance matters related to special meeting requests  as well as costs associated with the relocation of a future ride and costs associated with the transition to a new advertising agency 
additionally  selling  general and administrative costs increased due to an increase in costs associated with our long term executive compensation plans resulting in large part from the increase in the market price of our units during the period 
the comparison is impacted by approximately million of expense recorded in for the terminated merger and a million non recurring payroll tax credit received in the overall increase in costs and expenses also reflects the negative impact of exchange rates on our canadian operations million during during  we recognized million in non cash charges for the retirement of assets in the normal course of business 
this compares to a non cash charge of million at great america for the partial impairment of its fixed assets and a million charge for asset retirements across all properties 
additionally  non cash charges of million and million were recorded during the second and fourth quarters of  respectively  for the partial impairment of trade names originally recorded at the time of the ppi acquisition 
although the acquisition of the ppi parks continues to meet our collective operating and profitability goals  the performance of certain acquired parks fell below our original expectations in  which when coupled with a higher cost of capital  resulted in the impairment charges recorded in it is important to note that each of the acquired ppi parks produces positive cash flow  and that trade name write downs and fixed asset impairment losses do not affect cash  adjusted ebitda or liquidity 

table of contents depreciation and amortization expense for decreased million resulting primarily from the impairment charge taken on the fixed assets of california s great america at the end of after depreciation and amortization  as well impairment charges and all other operating costs  operating income for increased million to million from million in interest expense for the year increased million to million from million in  primarily due to an increase in the amortization of loan fees of million  which were incurred as a result of the july debt refinancing  as well as the february amendment to the credit agreement 
additionally  interest expense increased due to higher average interest rates as result of refinancing a portion of term debt with the bond indenture in july this increase in rates was slightly offset by a decline in rates on our derivative portfolio during the fourth quarter of  as billion of derivatives matured and were replaced by derivatives with lower effective interest rates 
also  as the result of the july refinancing  a million loss on the early extinguishment of debt was recognized and recorded in the statement of operations for during  the net effect of our swaps increased million to a non cash benefit to earnings of million  reflecting gains from marking the ineffective and de designated swaps to market  offset somewhat by the regularly scheduled amortization of amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci related to the swaps and foreign currency losses related to the us dollar denominated canadian term loan in the current period 
during the year  we also recognized a million charge to earnings for unrealized realized foreign currency losses  million of which represents unrealized foreign currency losses on the us dollar denominated notes issued in july and held by our canadian subsidiary 
a provision for taxes of million was recorded in  consisting of a provision for the tax attributes of our corporate subsidiaries of million and a provision for publicly traded partnership ptp taxes of million 
this compares with a provision for taxes of million in  consisting of a benefit of million for the tax attributes of our corporate subsidiaries and a provision of million for ptp taxes 
after interest expense and provision for taxes  net income for the period totaled million  or per diluted limited partner unit  compared with net loss of million  or per unit  a year ago 
we believe adjusted ebitda is a meaningful measure of our operating results for additional information regarding adjusted ebitda  including how we define and use adjusted ebitda  as well as a reconciliation from net income  see note in item  selected financial data  on pages 
in  adjusted ebitda increased million  or  to million  with our adjusted ebitda margin adjusted ebitda divided by net revenues decreasing basis points bps to from in the margin compression is primarily the result of a shift in the mix of operating profit in toward our lower margin parks

table of contents consolidated net revenues totaled million in  increasing million  from million in the increase in revenues reflects an  or million visit  increase in attendance from the improved attendance was largely due to an increase in season pass visits  the result of an increase in the number of season passes sold  particularly at our parks in the southern and western regions 
in addition  attendance in benefited from an increase in group sales business as many of our parks saw the return of numerous group bookings that were lost in  as well as favorable weather conditions throughout much of the operating season  including the all important fall season 
the increase in revenues also reflects an increase of  or approximately million  in out of park revenues  which represents the sale of hotel rooms  food  merchandise and other complementary activities located outside of the park gates 
the increase in out of park revenues was primarily driven by an increase in occupancy and average daily room rates at most of our hotel properties 
slightly offsetting the increases in attendance and out of park revenues was a less than  or  decrease in average in park guest per capita spending during in park guest per capita spending represents the amount spent per attendee to gain admission to a park  plus all amounts spent while inside the park gates 
for the fiscal year  average in park per capita spending increased in the northern region  but this increase was offset by declines in per capita spending in the southern and western regions 
the declines in those regions were in part the result of the increase in season pass visits 
the increase in revenues for the fiscal year also reflects the impact of currency exchange rates and the weakening us dollar on our canadian operations approximately million during operating costs and expenses increased million in  or  to million versus million for the increase reflects million of costs incurred in in connection with the terminated apollo merger  an increase in scheduled maintenance expense across the parks of approximately million  increases in operating supplies and seasonal wages of approximately million and million  respectively  the result of increased attendance  and the negative impact of currency exchange rates on our canadian operating expenses of approximately million during the comparison between and is also affected by certain one time costs incurred in  including million of litigation costs for the settlement of a california class action lawsuit and a license dispute with paramount pictures  as well as million of costs for the terminated apollo merger 
depreciation and amortization expense for decreased million due primarily to lower amortization expense in resulting from the accelerated amortization in of the intangible asset related to the nickelodeon licensing agreement  which was not renewed at the end of during the second and fourth quarters of  we recognized non cash charges of million and million  respectively  for the partial impairment of trade names originally recorded at the time of the ppi acquisition 
this compares with a non cash charge of million for the impairment of trade names in additionally in the fourth quarter of  we recognized a non cash charge of million at great america for the partial impairment of its fixed assets and a million charge for asset retirements across all properties

the comparison of operating income between and is also affected by a million gain on the sale of other assets in in late august of  we completed the sale of acres of surplus land at canada s wonderland to the vaughan health campus of care in ontario  canada as part of our ongoing efforts to reduce debt 
net proceeds from this sale totaled million and resulted in the recognition of a million gain during after this gain  as well as depreciation  amortization  impairment losses and all other operating costs  operating income for decreased million to million compared with million in in july  we completed the refinancing of our outstanding debt by issuing million of senior unsecured notes and entering into a new  million credit agreement  resulting in the recognition of a million loss during the year on the early extinguishment of our previous debt 
as a result of the financing  as well as the august amendment that extended million of term debt  interest rate spreads were higher during than in based on the higher interest rate spreads  interest expense for increased million to million from million in during  the net effect of our swaps increased million to a non cash charge to earnings of million  reflecting the regularly scheduled amortization of amounts in aoci related to the swaps  offset somewhat by gains from marking the ineffective and de designated swaps to market and foreign currency gains related to the us dollar denominated canadian term loan in the current period

table of contents financial condition with respect to both liquidity and cash flow  we ended in sound condition 
the negative working capital ratio current liabilities divided by current assets of at december  was the result of our highly seasonal business  as well as the impact of the fair value liability of our cross currency swap agreements that expire in february becoming current 
receivables and inventories are at normally low seasonal levels and credit facilities are in place to fund current liabilities  capital expenditures  partnership distributions  and pre opening expenses as required 
operating activities net cash from operating activities in increased million to million from million in the increase in operating cash flows between years was primarily attributable to the increase in the operating results of our parks and positive change in working capital 
net cash from operating activities in decreased million to million from million in the decrease in operating cash flows between years was primarily attributable to the negative change in working capital  excluding the impact of debt related and non cash items  offset somewhat by the increase in the operating results of our parks 
investing activities investing activities consist principally of acquisitions and capital investments we make in our parks and resort properties 
during  cash used for investing activities totaled million  compared to million in and million in the increase in was due to the timing of capital expenditures for rides being placed into service in the change between and was primarily the result of a million influx of cash in from the sale of excess land at canada s wonderland 
historically  we have been able to improve our revenues and profitability by continuing to make substantial capital investments in our park and resort facilities 
this has enabled us to maintain or increase attendance levels  as well as to generate increases in guest per capita spending and revenues from guest accommodations 
for the operating season  we will be investing approximately million in capital investments across our properties  with the highlight of the program being the addition of leviathan  a foot tall steel coaster  at canada s wonderland 
in addition to leviathan  a thrill seeking foot tall swing ride  successfully introduced at four parks in  will be installed at both kings dominion and carowinds 
in addition to new thrill rides  we are also investing in other capital improvements across our parks  including the introduction of four dinosaur attractions at cedar point  canada s wonderland  kings dominion  and dorney park and the addition of restaurants  entertainment offerings and resort upgrades across our properties 
financing activities net cash utilized for financing activities in  which reflects the february refinancing of our debt  totaled million  compared with million in and million in an increase in distribution payments in million vs 
million in was somewhat offset by an increase in cash from operating activities 
the decrease between and of million was primarily attributable to lower distribution payments made to partners in million compared to million 
reflected in the total is the retirement of million of term debt with funds obtained from the sale of excess land near canada s wonderland 
liquidity and capital resources in july  we issued million of senior unsecured notes the notes in a private placement  including million of original issue discount to yield 
the notes mature in concurrently with this offering  we entered into a new  million credit agreement the credit agreement  which includes a  million senior secured term loan facility and a million senior secured revolving credit facility 
the net proceeds from the offering of the notes  along with borrowings under the credit agreement  were used to repay in full all amounts outstanding under our previous credit facilities 
on february   we amended the credit agreement as so amended  the amended credit agreement and extended the maturity date of the us term loan portion of the credit facilities by one year 
certain terms of the amendment are described below 
terms of the credit agreement include a reduction in our previous million revolving credit facilities to a combined million facility 
under the agreement  the canadian portion of the revolving credit facility has a limit of million 
us denominated loans made under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate of libor plus bps with no libor floor 
canadian denominated loans made under the canadian portion of the facility also bear interest at a rate of libor plus bps with no libor floor 
the revolving credit facility  which matures in july  also provides for the issuance of documentary and standby letters of credit 
the extended us term loan  as amended on february   amortizes at million per year and matures in december as a result of an optional million pre payment made in august  other than the payment to be made as a result of the excess cash flow ecf computation discussed below  there are no scheduled maturities for the next months after this filing 
the extended us term loan bears interest at a rate of libor plus bps  with a libor floor of bps 
until our amendment to the credit agreement  the us term loan bore interest at a rate of libor plus bps  with a libor floor of bps 

table of contents at december   we had  million of variable rate term debt  million of the fixed rate notes  and no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
after letters of credit  which totaled million at december   we had million of available borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
of our total term debt outstanding at the end of the year  none is scheduled to mature within the next twelve months  but we will be required to make a prepayment on the term loan based on an ecf provision in the amended credit agreement 
the ecf computation is based on our senior secured leverage ratio as of december  as a result of the ecf computation  a mandatory prepayment of million will be made by june  per the amended credit agreement and is reflected in the consolidated balance sheet in current maturities of long term debt 
our million face value of notes require semi annual interest payments in february and august  with the principal due in full on august  the notes may be redeemed  in whole or in part  at any time prior to august  at a price equal to of the principal amount of the notes redeemed plus a make whole premium together with accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the redemption date 
thereafter  the notes may be redeemed  in whole or in part  at various prices depending on the date redeemed 
prior to august   up to of the notes may be redeemed with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at 
in  we entered into several fixed rate interest rate swap agreements totaling billion 
the weighted average fixed libor rate on those interest rate swaps  which matured in october  was 
based upon our scheduled quarterly regression analysis testing for the effectiveness of the accounting treatment of these swaps  as well as changes in the forward interest rate yield curves used in that testing  the swaps were deemed to be ineffective beginning in october and continued through their maturity 
this resulted in the swaps not qualifying for hedge accounting during the fourth quarter of through october of in  we entered into two cross currency swap agreements  which mature in february and effectively converted million of term debt at the time  and the associated interest payments  from us dollar denominated debt at a rate of libor plus bps to fixed rate canadian dollar denominated debt 
as a result of paying down the underlying canadian term debt with net proceeds from the sale of surplus land near canada s wonderland in august  the notional amounts of the underlying debt and the cross currency swaps no longer matched 
because of the mismatch of the notional amounts  we determined the swaps would no longer be highly effective going forward  resulting in the de designation of the swaps as of the end of august the fair market value of these instruments at december  was a million liability  which was recorded in current derivative liability on the consolidated balance sheet 
based on the change in currency exchange rates from the time we originally entered into the cross currency swap agreements in  the termination liability of the swaps has increased steadily over time 
in order to minimize further downside risk to the swaps termination value  in may we entered into several foreign currency swap agreements to fix the exchange rate on of the liability 
in july  we fixed the exchange rate on another of the swap liability  leaving only exposed to further fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
the fair market value of the foreign currency swap agreements in place as of december  was a liability of million  which was also recorded in current derivative liability on the condensed consolidated balance sheet 
based on currency exchange rates in place at the termination date and the exchange rates contracted in the foreign currency swap agreements  the cash termination costs of the cross currency swaps totaled million on february  in addition to the above mentioned covenants and provisions  the amended credit agreement contains an initial three year requirement that at least of our aggregate term debt and senior notes be subject to either a fixed interest rate or interest rate protection 
as of december   we were in compliance with this requirement as discussed below 
in order to maintain fixed interest costs on a portion of our domestic term debt beyond the expiration of the swaps that matured in october  in september we entered into several forward starting swap agreements that effectively convert a total of million of libor based variable rate debt to fixed rates beginning in october the weighted average fixed rate on these libor based interest rate swaps  which mature in december  is 
in order to monetize the difference in the libor floors  in march we entered into several additional forward starting basis rate swap agreements march swaps that  when combined with the september swaps  effectively convert million of variable rate debt to fixed rates beginning in october the september swaps and the march swaps  which have been jointly designated as cash flow hedges  mature in december and fix libor at a weighted average rate of 
on may   we entered into four additional forward starting interest rate swap agreements may forward starting swaps that effectively convert another million of variable rate debt to fixed rates beginning in october these swaps  which have been designated as cash flow hedges  mature in december and fix libor at a weighted average rate of 
the fair market value of all million of forward starting swap agreements at december  was a liability of million  which was recorded in derivative liability on the condensed consolidated balance sheet

the most critical of these ratios is the consolidated leverage ratio 
at the end of  this ratio was set at x consolidated total debt excluding the revolving debt to consolidated ebitda 
as of december   our consolidated total debt excluding revolving debt to consolidated ebitda ratio was x  providing million of consolidated ebitda cushion on the consolidated leverage ratio 
we were in compliance with all other covenants under the amended credit agreement as of december  the amended credit agreement  also includes provisions that allowed us to make restricted payments of up to million in and up to million annually thereafter  at the discretion of the board of directors  so long as no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing 
these restricted payments are not subject to any specific covenants 
beginning in  additional restricted payments are allowed to be made based on an excess cash flow formula  should our pro forma consolidated leverage ratio be less than or equal to x consolidated total debt excluding the revolving debt to consolidated ebitda as defined  measured on a quarterly basis 
per the terms of the indenture governing our notes  our ability to make restricted payments in and beyond is permitted should our trailing twelve month total indebtedness to consolidated cash flow ratio be less than or equal to x consolidated total indebtedness including average revolving debt to consolidated ebitda  measured on a quarterly basis

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates  and to a lesser extent on currency exchange rates on our operations in canada and  from time to time  on imported rides and equipment 
the objective of our financial risk management is to reduce the potential negative impact of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to acceptable levels 
we do not acquire market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
we manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed rate long term debt  interest rate swaps that fix a portion of our variable rate long term debt  and variable rate borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
translation exposures with regard to our canadian operations are not hedged 
for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges  the effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income loss and reclassified into earnings in the period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
changes in fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify as effective hedging activities are reported as net effect of swaps in the consolidated statement of operations 
additionally  the other comprehensive income loss related to interest rate swaps that become ineffective is amortized over the remaining life of the interest rate swap  and reported as a component of net effect of swaps in the consolidated statement of operations 
after considering the impact of interest rate swap agreements  at december   approximately billion of our outstanding long term debt represents fixed rate debt and approximately million represents variable rate debt 
assuming an average balance on our revolving credit borrowings of approximately million  a hypothetical bps increase in day libor on our variable rate debt would lead to an increase of approximately million in annual cash interest costs due to the impact of our fixed rate swap agreements 
a uniform strengthening of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar would result in a million decrease in annual operating income 
impact of inflation substantial increases in costs and expenses could impact our operating results to the extent such increases could not be passed along to our guests 
in particular  increases in labor  supplies  taxes  and utility expenses could have an impact on our operating results 
the majority of our employees are seasonal and are paid hourly rates which are consistent with federal and state minimum wage laws 
historically  we have been able to pass along cost increases to guests through increases in admission  food  merchandise and other prices  and we believe that we will continue to have the ability to do so over the long term 
we believe that the effects of inflation  if any  on our operating results and financial condition have been and will continue to be minor
