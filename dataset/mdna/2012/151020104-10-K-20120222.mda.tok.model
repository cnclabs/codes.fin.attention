gross to net sales accruals we record gross to net sales accruals for sales returns and allowances  sales discounts  government rebates  and chargebacks and distributor service fees 
revlimid is distributed in the united states through contracted pharmacies under the revassist program  which is a proprietary risk management distribution program tailored specifically to help ensure the safe and appropriate distribution and use of revlimid 
internationally  revlimid is distributed under mandatory risk management distribution programs tailored to meet local competent authorities specifications to help ensure the product s safe and appropriate distribution and use 
these programs may vary by country and  depending upon the country and the design of the risk management program  the product may be sold through hospitals or retail pharmacies 
thalomid is distributed in the united states under our proprietary system for thalidomide education and prescribing safety  or steps  program  which is a comprehensive education and risk management distribution program with the objective of providing for the safe and appropriate distribution and use of thalomid 
internationally  thalomid is distributed under mandatory risk management distribution programs tailored to meet local competent authorities specifications to help ensure the safe and appropriate distribution and use of thalomid 
these programs may vary by country and  depending upon the country and the design of the risk management program  the product may be sold through hospitals or retail pharmacies 
vidaza  istodax and abraxane are distributed through the more traditional pharmaceutical industry supply chain and are not subject to the same risk management distribution programs as thalomid and revlimid 

table of contents we base our sales returns allowance on estimated on hand retail hospital inventories  measured end customer demand as reported by third party sources  actual returns history and other factors  such as the trend experience for lots where product is still being returned or inventory centralization and rationalization initiatives conducted by major pharmacy chains  as applicable 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future returns  then a change in the allowance would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in that period could be materially affected 
under this methodology  we track actual returns by individual production lots 
returns on closed lots  that is  lots no longer eligible for return credits  are analyzed to determine historical returns experience 
returns on open lots  that is  lots still eligible for return credits  are monitored and compared with historical return trend rates 
any changes from the historical trend rates are considered in determining the current sales return allowance 
as noted above  revlimid is distributed primarily through hospitals and contracted pharmacies  lending itself to tighter controls of inventory quantities within the supply channel and  thus  resulting in lower returns activity 
thalomid is drop shipped directly to the prescribing pharmacy and  as a result  wholesalers do not stock the product 
sales discount accruals are based on payment terms extended to customers 
government rebate accruals are based on estimated payments due to governmental agencies for purchases made by third parties under various governmental programs 
us medicaid rebate accruals are generally based on historical payment data and estimates of future medicaid beneficiary utilization applied to the medicaid unit rebate formula established by the center for medicaid and medicare services 
the medicaid rebate percentage was increased and extended to medicaid managed care organizations in march the accrual of rebates associated with medicaid managed care organizations is calculated based on estimated historical patient data related to medicaid managed care organizations 
net revenues for the period ended december  were negatively impacted by a component of the health care reform act  which became effective in january and required manufacturers of pharmaceutical products to be responsible for of the patient s cost of branded prescription drugs related to the medicare part d coverage gap 
in order to estimate the cost to us of this coverage gap responsibility  we analyze data for eligible medicare part d patients against data for eligible medicare part d patients treated with our products as well as actual invoice data throughout this expense is recognized throughout the year as incurred 
in addition  certain international markets have government sponsored programs that require rebates to be paid based on program specific rules and  accordingly  the rebate accruals are determined primarily on estimated eligible sales 
the health care reform act mandated an annual fee in payable by branded prescription drug manufacturers and importers on branded prescription drugs 
the fee  which was not material  is included in selling  general and administrative on the consolidated statements of income 
rebates or administrative fees are offered to certain wholesale customers  group purchasing organizations and end user customers  consistent with pharmaceutical industry practices 
settlement of rebates and fees may generally occur from one to months from the date of sale 
we provide a provision for rebates at the time of sale based on contracted rates and historical redemption rates 
assumptions used to establish the provision include level of wholesaler 
table of contents inventories  contract sales volumes and average contract pricing 
we regularly review the information related to these estimates and adjust the provision accordingly 
chargeback accruals are based on the differentials between product acquisition prices paid by wholesalers and lower government contract pricing paid by eligible customers covered under federally qualified programs 
distributor service fee accruals are based on contractual fees to be paid to the wholesale distributor for services provided 
tricare is a health care program of the us department of defense military health system that provides civilian health benefits for military personnel  military retirees and their dependents 
tricare rebate accruals are based on estimated department of defense eligible sales multiplied by the tricare rebate formula

amounts due from customers increased primarily in the united states and certain european countries 
sales made outside the united states typically have payment terms that are greater than days  thereby extending collection periods beyond those in the united states 
we expect our accounts receivable balance to continue to grow as our international sales continue to expand 
we continue to monitor economic conditions  including the volatility associated with international economies  the sovereign debt crisis in certain european countries and associated impacts on the financial markets and our business 
our current business model in these markets is to sell our products directly to principally government owned or controlled hospitals  who in turn directly deliver critical care to patients 
our products are used to treat life threatening diseases and we believe this business model enables timely delivery and adequate supply of 
table of contents products 
many of the outstanding receivable balances are related to government funded hospitals and we believe the receivable balances are ultimately collectible 
similarly  we believe that future sales to these customers will continue to be collectible 
the credit and economic conditions within greece  spain  italy  and portugal  as well as increasing sales levels in those countries have resulted in  and may continue to result in  an increase in the average length of time it takes to collect accounts receivable 
our total net receivables in spain  italy and portugal are composed almost entirely of amounts receivable from government owned or controlled hospitals and the public sector and amounted to million at the end of compared to million at the end of approximately million of the million receivable at december  was greater than one year past due 
our exposure to the sovereign debt crisis in greece is limited  as we do not have a material amount of receivables in greece 
we maintain timely and direct communication with hospital customers in italy  portugal  and spain regarding both the current and past due receivable balances 
we continue to receive payments from these countries  and closely monitor the plans for payment at the regional government level 
we also regularly request and receive positive confirmation of the validity of our receivables from most of the regional governmental authorities 
we have the option to pursue legal action against certain of our customers 
in view of the protracted timeline associated with collecting the outstanding balances through legal action and the current direct communication with our customers  in many instances  we do not believe this to be the best approach for any of the parties involved 
in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts for italy  portugal  and spain  we considered that the balance of past due receivables is related to sales made to government owned or supported customers 
we regularly monitor developments in europe to assess whether the level of risk of default for any customers has increased and note the ongoing efforts by the european union  european monetary union and international monetary fund to support countries with large public deficits and outstanding debt balances 
we have not experienced significant losses or write offs with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable in these countries as a result of their economic difficulties and we do not expect to have write offs or adjustments to accounts receivable which would have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations 
inventory inventory balances decreased by million to million at the end of compared to the end of  primarily due to a million reduction in abraxane inventory related to the inventory step up adjustment to fair value resulting from the acquisition of abraxis  which flowed through cost of goods sold during the favorable impact from the reduction in the step up adjustment was partly offset by an increase in revlimid  vidaza and abraxane inventories  attributable to higher sales levels 
other current assets other current assets increased by million to million at the end of compared to the end of primarily due to a million increase in the fair value of foreign currency forward contracts  in addition to increases in royalties receivable and other prepaid expenses  including taxes and insurance 
commercial paper in september  we entered into a commercial paper program  or the program  under which we issued unsecured commercial paper notes  or commercial paper  on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 
table of contents billion  the proceeds of which will be used for general corporate purposes 
the maturities of the commercial paper may vary  but may not exceed days from the date of issue 
the commercial paper is sold under customary terms to a dealer or in the commercial paper market and is issued at a discount from par or  alternatively  is sold at par and bears varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis 
borrowings under the program are accounted for as short term borrowings 
as of the end of  million of commercial paper was outstanding bearing an effective interest rate of 
senior unsecured credit facility in september  we entered into a senior unsecured revolving credit facility  or the credit facility  providing for revolving credit in the aggregate amount of billion 
subject to certain conditions  we have the right to increase the amount of the credit facility but in no event more than one time per annum  up to a maximum aggregate amount of billion 
the credit facility has a five year term and amounts may be borrowed for working capital  capital expenditures and other corporate purposes 
the credit facility serves as backup liquidity for our commercial paper borrowings 
as of the end of  there was no outstanding borrowing under the credit facility 
the credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants including certain customary financial covenants 
we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of the end of credit facility in november  we entered into an uncommitted facility  or facility  not exceeding an aggregate of million 
advances are to be in currencies agreed upon and will be for periods of one or three months 
interest will accrue and be calculated in respect to each advance on the basis of the number of days elapsed and a day year in the case of advances in us dollars at a rate per annum of above libor 
interest accrued on each advance will be paid at its maturity 
the facility may be terminated at any time by the lending party with or without prior notice 
as of the end of  million was outstanding under the facility and accounted for as short term borrowings 
the outstanding balance was repaid in january accounts payable  accrued expenses and other current liabilities accounts payable  accrued expenses and other current liabilities decreased by million to million as of the end of compared to the end of the decrease was primarily due to the payment of million of contingent consideration related to the purchase of gloucester  which had a fair value of million on december  and payment of a litigation settlement  which was reserved for at million in  mostly offset by increases in governmental rebates and medicaid reimbursements  in addition to clinical trial and compensation related accruals 
income taxes payable current and non current income taxes payable increased by million to million as of the end of compared to the end of  primarily from the current provision for income taxes of million  mostly offset by tax payments of million and a tax benefit of stock options of million

the net proceeds from this sale amounted to million 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities in was billion compared to net cash provided of billion in the billion decrease in net cash provided by financing activities in was primarily attributable to proceeds from the issuance of long term debt in that provided net cash of billion and the billion in common share repurchases in under the common share repurchase program

at december   our remaining commitment resulting from the acquisition was million 
in addition  we have committed to invest an aggregate million in two investment funds over a ten year period  which is callable at any time 
on december   our remaining investment commitment was million 
collaboration arrangements we have entered into certain research and development collaboration agreements with third parties that include the funding of certain development  manufacturing and commercialization efforts with the potential for future milestone and royalty payments upon the achievement of pre established developmental  regulatory and or commercial 
table of contents targets 
our obligation to fund these efforts is contingent upon continued involvement in the programs and or the lack of any adverse events which could cause the discontinuance of the programs 
due to the nature of these arrangements  the future potential payments related to the attainment of specified development and regulatory approval milestones over a period of several years are inherently uncertain  and accordingly  no amounts have been recorded in our consolidated balance sheets at december  and contained in this annual report on form k 
potential milestone payments total approximately billion  including approximately billion contingent on the achievement of various research  development and regulatory approval milestones and approximately billion in sales based milestones 
the most significant collaboration agreements are identified in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
new accounting principles in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued accounting standards update  or asu  no 
 balance sheet topic disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities  or asu under asu  an entity is required to disclose both gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position as well as instruments and transactions executed under a master netting or similar arrangement and was issued to enable users of financial statements to understand the effects or potential effects of those arrangements on its financial position 
asu is required to be applied retrospectively and is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning on or after january  the adoption of asu is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment  or asu the update simplifies how a company tests goodwill for impairment 
asu allows a company the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
under that option  an entity would no longer be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines  based on that qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
asu is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted 
the adoption of asu in is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income topic  or asu asu was issued to improve the comparability  consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income 
the guidance in asu eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity and requires that all non owner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
asu will be effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning on or after december  the adoption of asu will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued accounting standards update  or asu  no 
 comprehensive income topic deferral of the effective 
table of contents date for amendments to the presentation of reclassification of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 
 or asu under asu  the requirements for the presentation of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income that were in place before the issuance of update are reinstated  effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning on or after december  the adoption of asu is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued asu no 
 fair value measurement topic  or asu asu was issued to improve the comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or us gaap  and international financial reporting standards  or ifrs 
the guidance in asu explains how to measure fair value  but does not require additional fair value measurements and is not intended to establish valuation standards or affect valuation practices outside of financial reporting 
asu will be effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning on or after december  the adoption of asu will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates and significant accounting policies a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operation and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  we believe the following accounting estimates and policies to be critical revenue recognition revenue from the sale of products is recognized when title and risk of loss of the product is transferred to the customer 
provisions for discounts  early payments  rebates  sales returns and distributor chargebacks under terms customary in the industry are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for volume based discounts and rebates at the time of the initial sale 
the estimated reductions to revenue for such volume based discounts and rebates are based on the sales terms  historical experience and trend analysis 
we recognize revenue from royalties based on licensees sales of our products or products using our technologies 
royalties are recognized as earned in accordance with the contract terms when royalties from licensees can be reasonably estimated and collectability is reasonably assured 
if royalties cannot be reasonably estimated or collectability of a royalty amount is not reasonably assured  royalties are recognized as revenue when the cash is received 
gross to net sales accruals we record gross to net sales accruals for sales returns and allowances  sales discounts  government rebates  and chargebacks and distributor service fees 
revlimid is distributed in the united states through contracted pharmacies under the revassist program  which is a proprietary risk management distribution program tailored specifically to help ensure the safe and appropriate distribution and use of revlimid 

table of contents internationally  revlimid is distributed under mandatory risk management distribution programs tailored to meet local competent authorities specifications to help ensure the product s safe and appropriate distribution and use 
these programs may vary by country and  depending upon the country and the design of the risk management program  the product may be sold through hospitals or retail pharmacies 
thalomid is distributed in the united states under our proprietary system for thalidomide education and prescribing safety  or steps  program  which is a comprehensive education and risk management distribution program with the objective of providing for the safe and appropriate distribution and use of thalomid 
internationally  thalomid is distributed under mandatory risk management distribution programs tailored to meet local competent authorities specifications to help ensure the safe and appropriate distribution and use of thalomid 
these programs may vary by country and  depending upon the country and the design of the risk management program  the product may be sold through hospitals or retail pharmacies 
vidaza  istodax and abraxane are distributed through the more traditional pharmaceutical industry supply chain and are not subject to the same risk management distribution programs as thalomid and revlimid 
we base our sales returns allowance on estimated on hand retail hospital inventories  measured end customer demand as reported by third party sources  actual returns history and other factors  such as the trend experience for lots where product is still being returned or inventory centralization and rationalization initiatives conducted by major pharmacy chains  as applicable 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future returns  then a change in the allowance would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in that period could be materially affected 
under this methodology  we track actual returns by individual production lots 
returns on closed lots  that is  lots no longer eligible for return credits  are analyzed to determine historical returns experience 
returns on open lots  that is  lots still eligible for return credits  are monitored and compared with historical return trend rates 
any changes from the historical trend rates are considered in determining the current sales return allowance 
as noted above  revlimid is distributed primarily through hospitals and contracted pharmacies  lending itself to tighter controls of inventory quantities within the supply channel and  thus  resulting in lower returns activity 
thalomid is drop shipped directly to the prescribing pharmacy and  as a result  wholesalers do not stock the product 
sales discount accruals are based on payment terms extended to customers 
government rebate accruals are based on estimated payments due to governmental agencies for purchases made by third parties under various governmental programs 
us medicaid rebate accruals are generally based on historical payment data and estimates of future medicaid beneficiary utilization applied to the medicaid unit rebate formula established by the center for medicaid and medicare services 
the medicaid rebate percentage was increased and extended to medicaid managed care organizations in march the accrual of rebates associated with medicaid managed care organizations is calculated based on estimated historical patient data related to medicaid managed care organizations 
net revenues for the period ended december  were negatively impacted by a component of the us health care reform act of  or health care reform act  which became effective in january and required manufacturers of pharmaceutical products to be responsible for of the patient s cost of branded prescription drugs related to the medicare part d coverage gap 
in order to estimate 
table of contents the cost to us of this coverage gap responsibility  we analyze data for eligible medicare part d patients against data for eligible medicare part d patients treated with our products as well as actual invoice data throughout this expense is recognized throughout the year as incurred 
in addition  certain international markets have government sponsored programs that require rebates to be paid based on program specific rules and  accordingly  the rebate accruals are determined primarily on estimated eligible sales 
the health care reform act mandated in an annual fee payable by branded prescription drug manufacturers and importers on branded prescription drugs 
the fee  which is not material  is included in selling  general and administrative on the consolidated statements of income 
rebates or administrative fees are offered to certain wholesale customers  group purchasing organizations and end user customers  consistent with pharmaceutical industry practices 
settlement of rebates and fees may generally occur from one to months from the date of sale 
we provide a provision for rebates at the time of sale based on contracted rates and historical redemption rates 
assumptions used to establish the provision include level of wholesaler inventories  contract sales volumes and average contract pricing 
we regularly review the information related to these estimates and adjust the provision accordingly 
chargeback accruals are based on the differentials between product acquisition prices paid by wholesalers and lower government contract pricing paid by eligible customers covered under federally qualified programs 
distributor service fee accruals are based on contractual fees to be paid to the wholesale distributor for services provided 
tricare is a health care program of the us department of defense military health system that provides civilian health benefits for military personnel  military retirees and their dependents 
tricare rebate accruals are based on estimated department of defense eligible sales multiplied by the tricare rebate formula 
allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts primarily based on the credit worthiness of our customers  historical payment patterns  aging of receivable balances and general economic conditions  including publicly available information on the credit worthiness of countries themselves and provinces or areas within such countries where they are the ultimate customers 
income taxes we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
we provide a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we account for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of our provision for income taxes 
these unrecognized tax benefits relate primarily to issues common among multinational corporations in our industry 
we apply a variety of methodologies in making these estimates which include studies performed by independent economists  advice from industry and subject experts  evaluation of public actions taken by the us internal revenue service and other taxing authorities  as well as our own industry experience 
we provide estimates for unrecognized tax benefits 
if our estimates are not representative of actual outcomes  our results of operations could be materially impacted 

table of contents we periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets  and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized 
we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of deferred tax assets  including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction  expectations of future taxable income  carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes  various income tax strategies and other relevant factors 
significant judgment is required in making this assessment and  to the extent future expectations change  we would have to assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets at that time 
at december   it was more likely than not that we would realize our deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowances 
share based compensation the cost of share based compensation is recognized in the consolidated statements of income based on the fair value of all awards granted  using the black scholes method of valuation for stock options 
the fair values of restricted stock units and performance restricted stock units are based on the market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
the fair value of each award is determined and the compensation cost is recognized over the service period required to obtain full vesting 
compensation cost to be recognized reflects an estimate of the number of awards expected to vest after taking into consideration an estimate of award forfeitures based on actual experience 
other than temporary impairments of available for sale marketable securities a decline in the market value of any available for sale marketable security below its cost that is deemed to be other than temporary results in a reduction in carrying amount to fair value 
the impairment is charged to operations and a new cost basis for the security established 
the determination of whether an available for sale marketable security is other than temporarily impaired requires significant judgment and requires consideration of available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating the potential impairment 
factors evaluated to determine whether the investment is other than temporarily impaired include significant deterioration in the issuer s earnings performance  credit rating  asset quality  business prospects of the issuer  adverse changes in the general market conditions in which the issuer operates  length of time that the fair value has been below our cost  our expected future cash flows from the security  our intent not to sell and an evaluation as to whether it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell before recovery of our cost basis 
assumptions associated with these factors are subject to future market and economic conditions  which could differ from our assessment 
derivatives and hedging activities all derivative instruments are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income loss  depending on whether a derivative instrument is designated as part of a hedging transaction and  if it is  the type of hedging transaction 
for a derivative to qualify as a hedge at inception and throughout the hedged period  we formally document the nature and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged item 
we assess  both at inception and on an on going basis  whether the derivative instruments that are used in cash flow hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows of hedged items 
we assess hedge effectiveness on a quarterly basis and record the gain or loss related to the ineffective portion of derivative instruments  if any  to current earnings 
if we determine that a forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring  we discontinue hedge accounting and any related unrealized gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in current earnings 
we use derivative instruments  including 
table of contents those not designated as part of a hedging transaction  to manage our exposure to movements in foreign exchange and interest rates 
the use of these derivative instruments modifies the exposure of these risks with the intent to reduce our risk or cost 
we do not use derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes and are not a party to leveraged derivatives 
investments we apply the equity method of accounting to our investment in common stock of an affiliated company and certain investment funds  which primarily invest in companies conducting business in life sciences such as biotechnology  pharmaceuticals  medical technology  medical devices  diagnostics and health and wellness 
we also maintain a portfolio of strategic investments in equity securities on a cost method basis which are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
all of our investments are reviewed on a regular basis for possible impairment 
if an investment s fair value is determined to be less than its net carrying value and the decline is determined to be other than temporary  the investment is written down to its fair value 
such an evaluation is judgmental and dependent on specific facts and circumstances 
factors considered in determining whether an other than temporary decline in value has occurred include market value or exit price of the investment based on either market quoted prices or future rounds of financing by the investee  length of time that the market value was below its cost basis  financial condition and business prospects of the investee  our intent and ability to retain the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery in market value of the investment  issues that raise concerns about the investee s ability to continue as a going concern  and any other information that we may be aware of related to the investment 
accounting for long term incentive plans we have established a long term incentive plan  or ltip  designed to provide key officers and executives with performance based incentive opportunities contingent upon achievement of pre established corporate performance objectives covering a three year period 
we currently have three three year performance cycles running concurrently ending december   and performance measures for the performance cycles ending in and are based on the following components in the last year of the three year cycle on non gaap earnings per share  on non gaap net income  and on total non gaap revenue  as defined 
the performance cycle ending in is based on the following components in on non gaap earnings per share  on total non gaap revenue  as defined  and on relative total shareholder return  which is a measurement of our stock price performance during the year compared with a group of other companies in the biopharmaceutical industry 
payouts may be in the range of to of the participant s salary for the plans 
awards are payable in cash or  at our discretion  in our common stock or a mixture of cash and our common stock 
for selected participants at our discretion  awards are payable in our common stock  with the number of shares determined using the average closing price for the trading days prior to the beginning of the cycle  or a mixture of cash and our common stock 
payments made in our common stock are restricted from trading for a period of three years 
we accrue the long term incentive liability over each three year cycle 
prior to the end of a three year cycle  the accrual is based on an estimate of our level of achievement during the cycle 
upon a change in control  participants will be entitled to an immediate payment equal to their target award  or an award based on actual performance  if higher  through the date of the change in control 

table of contents accruals recorded for the ltip entail making certain assumptions concerning future non gaap earnings per share  non gaap net income and non gaap revenues  as defined  the actual results of which could be materially different than the assumptions used 
accruals for the ltip are reviewed on a regular basis and revised accordingly so that the liability recorded reflects updated estimates of future payouts 
in estimating the accruals  management considers actual results to date for the performance period  expected results for the remainder of the performance period  operating trends  product development  pricing and competition 
valuation of goodwill  acquired intangible assets and ipr d we have recorded goodwill  acquired intangible assets and ipr d primarily through the acquisitions of pharmion  gloucester and abraxis 
when identifiable intangible assets  including in process research and development  are acquired  we determine the fair values of these assets as of the acquisition date 
discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations if quoted market prices are not available  and the models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to projecting regulatory approvals  estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in process projects and developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination accounted for by the acquisition method of accounting and is not amortized  but subject to impairment testing at least annually or when a triggering event occurs that could indicate a potential impairment 
we test our goodwill annually for impairment each november we are organized as a single reporting unit and therefore the goodwill impairment test is done using our overall market value  as determined by our traded share price  as compared to our book value of net assets 
intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment if certain events occur 
intangible assets related to ipr d product rights are treated as indefinite lived intangible assets and not amortized until the product is approved for sale by regulatory authorities in specified markets 
at that time  we will determine the useful life of the asset  reclassify the asset out of ipr d and begin amortization 
impairment testing is also performed at least annually or when a triggering event occurs that could indicate a potential impairment 
such test entails completing an updated discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of the asset 
our ipr d product rights were obtained in the gloucester and abraxis acquisitions 
the gloucester related product rights will become definite lived intangibles when marketing approval is received for istodax for treatment of ptcl in the european union 
the abraxis related product rights will become definite lived intangibles when marketing approval is received for abraxane for treatment of either nsclc  pancreatic cancer or melanoma in a major market  typically either the united states or the european union  or in a series of other countries  subject to certain specified conditions and management judgment 
valuation of contingent consideration resulting from a business combination we record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition 
table of contents date  and for each subsequent reporting period revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating earnings in the consolidated statements of income 
changes to contingent consideration obligations can result from movements in publicly traded share prices of cvrs  adjustments to discount rates and periods  updates in the assumed achievement or timing of any development milestones or changes in the probability of certain clinical events and changes in the assumed probability associated with regulatory approval 
the assumptions related to determining the value of a contingent consideration include a significant amount of judgment and any changes in the assumptions could have a material impact on the amount of contingent consideration expense recorded in any given period 
our contingent consideration liabilities were acquired in the acquisitions of gloucester and abraxis 
the fair value of the gloucester contingent consideration liability is based on the discount rate  probability and estimated timing of a cash milestone payment to the former gloucester shareholders 
the fair value of the abraxis contingent consideration liability is based on the quoted market price of the publicly traded cvrs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion provides forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risk 
market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments 
the risk of loss is assessed based on the likelihood of adverse changes in fair values  cash flows or future earnings 
we have established guidelines relative to the diversification and maturities of investments to maintain safety and liquidity 
these guidelines are reviewed periodically and may be modified depending on market conditions 
although investments may be subject to credit risk  our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure from any single issue  issuer or type of investment

corporate debt global includes obligations issued by investment grade corporations including some issues that have been guaranteed by governments and government agencies 
marketable securities available for sale are carried at fair value  held for an unspecified period of time and are intended for use in meeting our ongoing liquidity needs 
unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities  which are deemed to be temporary  are reported as a 
table of contents separate component of stockholders equity  net of tax 
the cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity 
the amortization  along with realized gains and losses and other than temporary impairment charges  is included in interest and investment income  net 
as of december   the principal amounts  fair values and related weighted average interest rates of our investments in debt securities classified as marketable securities available for sale were as follows dollar amounts in thousands duration less than year to years to years total principal amount fair value average interest rate long term debt in october  we issued a total of billion principal amount of senior notes consisting of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due  million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due and million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the notes were issued at  and of par  respectively  and the discount amortized as additional interest expense over the period from issuance through maturity 
interest on the notes is payable semi annually in arrears on april and october each year beginning april  and the principal on each note is due in full at their respective maturity dates

table of contents currency forward contracts entered into to hedge forecasted revenue and expenses were as follows in thousands notional amount foreign currency australian dollar british pound canadian dollar euro japanese yen swiss franc others total we consider the impact of our own and the counterparties credit risk on the fair value of the contracts as well as the ability of each party to execute its obligations under the contract 
as of december   credit risk did not materially change the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts 
we recognized decreases in net product sales for certain effective cash flow hedge instruments of thousand in and increases of million in these settlements were recorded in the same period as the related forecasted sales occurred 
changes in time value  which we excluded from the hedge effectiveness assessment  were included in other income expense  net 
we also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce exposures to foreign currency fluctuations of certain recognized assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
these foreign currency forward contracts have not been designated as hedges under asc and  accordingly  any changes in their fair value are recognized in other income expense  net in the current period 
changes in the fair value of these currency forward contracts that have not been designated as hedges resulted in gains of million in compared to losses of thousand in the aggregate notional amounts of the foreign currency forward non designated hedging contracts outstanding at december  and were million and million  respectively

assuming that the december  exchange rates were to change by a hypothetical  the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts would change by approximately million 
however  since the contracts either hedge specific forecasted intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies or relate to assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the entities functional currencies  any change in the fair value of the contract would be either reported in other comprehensive income and reclassified to earnings in the same periods during which the underlying hedged transactions affect earnings or re measured through earnings each period along with the underlying asset or liability 
from time to time we enter into interest rate swap contracts to convert a portion of our interest rate exposure from fixed rate to floating rate to more closely align interest expense with interest income received on our cash equivalent and investment balances
