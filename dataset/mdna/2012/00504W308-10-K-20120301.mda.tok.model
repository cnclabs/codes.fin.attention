executive level overview active power is headquartered in austin  texas  where we design and manufacture our patented flywheel based uninterruptible power supply ups systems and continuous power and infrastructure solutions 
these solutions ensure continuity for data centers and other mission critical operations in the event of power disturbances 
our products and solutions are designed to deliver continuous conditioned clean power during power disturbances and outages  voltage sags and surges  and provide ride through power in the event of utility failure  supporting operations until utility power is restored or a longer term alternative power source  such as a diesel generator is started 
we believe our products offer an advantage over those of our competitors in the areas of power density less space and energy efficiency  total cost of ownership  system reliability  modular design  and the economically green benefits of our solutions 
our patented flywheel based ups systems store kinetic energy by constantly spinning a compact steel wheel flywheel driven from utility power in a low friction environment 
when the utility power used to spin the flywheel fluctuates or is interrupted  the flywheel s inertia causes it to continue spinning 
the resulting kinetic energy of the spinning flywheel generates electricity known as bridging power for short periods  until either utility power is restored or a backup electric generator starts and takes over generating longer term power in the case of an extended electrical outage 
we believe our flywheel products provide many competitive advantages over conventional battery based ups systems  including substantial space savings  higher power densities  green energy storage  and higher power efficiencies up to 
this high energy efficiency reduces operating costs and provides customers a lower total cost of ownership 
we offer our flywheel products with load capabilities from kva to  kva 
we typically target higher power applications of kva and above  largely because the majority of customers in this market segment have backup generators 
our flywheel based ups systems are marketed under the brand name cleansource 
as of december   we have shipped more than  flywheels in ups system installations  delivering more than megawatts of power to customers in countries around the world 
we also sell continuous power systems cps  which incorporate our ups products with switchgear and a generator to provide complete short and long term protection in the event of a power disturbance 
where the cps is sold in a containerized package  it is marketed under the brand name powerhousetm 
powerhouse can be deployed in either a foot or foot long iso container depending upon the customer s power load requirements 
these systems are specifically designed to handle the demands of high tech facilities requiring the highest power integrity available while maximizing up time  useable floor space and operational efficiency 
designed to offer a highly flexible architecture to a customer s constantly changing environment  our powerhouse systems are offered in four standard modular power configurations  enabling sizing for infrastructure on demand 
these systems are highly differentiated as they offer flexibility in placement  space savings  fast deployment time after receipt of order  high energy efficiency  and prompt capital deployment to meet current demands 
they also deliver significant value to customers as the entire system is integrated and tested prior to delivery for a repeatable simple solution 
we also sell cps solutions to customers in a non containerized format  typically deploying such solutions inside buildings 
in close cooperation with strategic partners like hewlett packard and leveraging our expertise in containerization and power distribution  in we began to manufacture containerized infrastructure solutions  designed to specification for select business partners 
these solutions serve as the infrastructure for modular data centers  which are self contained fully functional data centers 
modular data centers may be rapidly deployed with other modular data centers as a cost effective alternative to traditional raised floor data centers 
active power designs and delivers the exterior shell and a fully outfitted interior including electrical  cooling  monitoring  and other elements ready for the customer to add its it racks and servers 
after the customer adds its it equipment to our containerized infrastructure solution  the customer has a functional data center 
containerized infrastructure solutions represented and  respectively  of and total revenue 
we expect revenue to grow in coming years from current and future customers as modular data center infrastructure continues to gain acceptance in the market 
in of our product revenue came from the sale of ups systems  from the sale of cps solutions and from the sale of infrastructure solutions 

table of contents we are headquartered in austin  texas  with international offices in the united kingdom  germany and china 
our total revenue in increased by million  or  from  primarily driven by an increase in the global demand for new data center construction and increased market acceptance of our products and solutions 
sales of our cps systems and containerized infrastructure solution products increased by approximately million  or  compared to as a number of global customers made repeated purchases of our cps products  reflecting growing acceptance of  and validation of the improved performance characteristics of our cps solutions and containerized infrastructure solution products 
however sales of our ups systems decreased by approximately million or compared to due to lower direct sales in the north american market 
we sell our products to a wide array of commercial and industrial customers across a variety of vertical markets  including data centers  manufacturing  technology  broadcast and communications  financial  utilities  healthcare  government and airports 
we have expanded our global sales channels and direct sales force  selling in major geographic regions of the world  but particularly in north america  europe and asia 
we sell our products through the following distribution methods sales made directly by active power  manufacturer s representatives  distributors  oem partners  and strategic it partners 
our revenue derived from north america was million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing  and  respectively  of our total revenues 
our revenue derived from customers located in europe was million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing  and  respectively  of our total revenues 
our revenue derived from customers located in asia was million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing  and  respectively  of our total revenues 
we achieved revenue growth in all of our primary markets during our largest revenue growth occurred in the european and asian market  where our revenues increased by million or and million or  respectively  over our growth in europe and asia in was primarily derived from increased sales of our containerized solutions 
in north america  our total revenue increased by million or over our strong growth in cps and infrastructure products in north america was offset by a decrease in ups revenue with lower sales volume from both our oem and direct sales channels 
we believe total revenue will grow in from all of our products and as we continue to focus on selling more complete systems rather than just products 
in particular  we expect continuing market acceptance of containerized solutions to drive higher sales of our powerhouse and containerized infrastructure solution products globally 
we also believe that the global growth in data center demand and from cloud based computing and storage requirements will also lead to higher sales of our ups products 
we are specifically targeting those customers with large it and power needs who have the ability to make frequent and large ups purchases as their global operations expand 
our gross margins still fluctuate on a quarterly basis depending on changes in the product mix of our revenues and were as high as during our first quarter of and as low as in the fourth quarter 
on an annual basis  our gross profit margin decreased to in from in and increased from in the decrease in gross profit margin from reflects the impact of an increase in the sales of our cps and infrastructure products as a percentage of our total revenue  the decrease in sales of our ups systems and lower than expected margins on service revenues associated with our cps solutions 
our cps and infrastructure products generally earn lower margins for us than sales of our ups product because they include a higher proportion of third party ancillary equipment 
absent other factors  an increase in revenue driven by these product categories would result in an overall lower margin for our business 
in  the effects of this change in product mix were further exacerbated by a decline in sales volume of our ups systems 
this resulted in higher unabsorbed manufacturing costs due to lower utilization of our manufacturing facility  further negatively impacting our gross margins 
our margins on services associated with cps installations have been lower than we expected 
as we mature and gain more experience in the deployment of these solutions  we have seen an improvement in the margins we generate from this business  and we were able to increase these margins in the last two quarters of our operating losses were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our operating losses include non cash stock based compensation expenses of million  million and million in  and respectively 
the increase in operating losses was due to the deterioration of our gross margin despite the growth in revenue and from a higher level of operating costs 
our operating costs increased by or million compared to  primarily due to higher headcount costs as we added capabilities and resources as we increased our cps and infrastructure businesses 
we also incurred approximately million in costs associated with a change in our chief executive officer and from costs associated with the closure of our sales and support operations in japan during the fourth quarter of 
table of contents the larger sales price of our powerhouse and containerized infrastructure orders can cause large quarterly fluctuations in our inventory  receivables and payables balances  depending on the number of such orders in progress at any point in time 
this can cause material fluctuations in the level of working capital we require 
if the number of such orders increases rapidly or any of these orders have payment terms that are less favorable  we will need access to more liquidity to fund the growth of our business and to fulfill these orders 
we increased our bank revolving line of credit in to provide a source of funding for this scenario  to help fund our growth and manage our working capital requirements 
we have a history of annual operating losses and have not yet reached operating profitability on an annual basis 
we believe that the success of our flywheel products and our cps and containerized infrastructure solutions  combined with our focus on direct sales to customers  will help us to further increase our revenues and reduce our level of operating losses and the amount of cash that we consume in our operations 
we continue to manage our level of operating costs and have recently taken a number of actions to contain our operating costs  including closing our sales headquarters operations in japan and realigning our manufacturing and support capabilities in the united kingdom 
we will need to continue to focus on operating costs  management of cash and working capital in in order to manage the level of funds we use in our operating activities 
our total cash and investments at december  were million  compared to million at december  we believe that our cash and investments and our sources of available liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
our sales cycle is such that we generally have visibility two to three quarters in advance for future orders that allows us to predict revenues over this period of time with some degree of confidence 
however  a sudden change in business volume or product mix  positive or negative  from any of our business or channel partners or in our direct business can significantly impact our expected revenues and impact our ability to quickly respond to opportunities 
the recent global economic downturn has reduced our confidence at predicting future revenues  and even with improving economic conditions  there is still uncertainty and risk in our forecasting 
this two to three quarter window of sales visibility does provide us with some opportunity to adjust expenditures or take other measures to reduce our cash consumption if we can see and anticipate a shortfall in revenue or give us time to identify additional sources of funding if we anticipate an increase in our working capital requirements due to increased revenues or changes in our revenue mix 
a significant increase in sales  especially in our powerhouse or our infrastructure solutions business  would likely increase our working capital requirements  due to the longer production time and cash cycle of sales of these products 
we established a revolving bank credit facility to help finance a growth in powerhouse and infrastructure solutions and believe that this will be adequate to sustain further growth in these products 
should additional funding be required or desirable  we would expect to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt or equity securities  the ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted 
if we obtain additional debt financing  a substantial portion of our operating cash flow may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness  and the terms of the debt securities issued could impose significant restrictions on our operations 
we do not know whether we will be able to secure additional funding  or funding on terms acceptable to us  to continue our operations as planned 
if financing is not available  we may be required to reduce  delay or eliminate certain activities or to license or sell to others some of our proprietary technology 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates we consider an accounting policy to be critical if the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain or require the use of judgment at the time we make that estimate  and changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  or use of different estimates that we could have reasonably used instead in the current period  would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
management has reviewed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed these disclosures 
in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical as defined above 
changes in these and other items could still have a material impact upon our financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts trade receivables are recorded at the stated amount  less an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance represents estimated uncollectible receivables associated with potential customer defaults on contractual obligations  usually due to the customer s potential insolvency 
the allowance includes amounts for certain customers where a risk of default has been specifically identified 
in addition  the allowance includes a provision for customer defaults on a general formula basis when it is determined the risk of some default is probable and estimable  but cannot yet be associated with certain customers 
the assessment of the likelihood of customer defaults is based on various factors  including the length of time the receivables are past due  risks unique to particular geographic regions  historical experience and existing economic conditions 
historically  a large portion of our sales have been made through oem channels to a few large customers  and so our credit losses have been minimal 
as we integrate additional distribution channels into our business and increase our direct sales to more and smaller customers  the risk of credit loss may increase 
inventories inventories are priced at the lower of cost using the first in  first out method or market 
we estimate inventory reserves on a quarterly basis and record reserves for obsolescence or slow moving inventory based on assumptions about future demand and marketability of products  the impact of new product introductions  inventory turns and specific identification of items  such as product discontinuance  damaged goods or engineering material changes 
warranty liability the estimated warranty liability costs are accrued for each of our products at the time of sale 
our estimates are principally based on assumptions regarding the lifetime warranty costs of each product  including where little or no claims experience may exist 
due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of these estimates  changes in our assumptions could have a material effect on our reported operating results 
our estimate of warranty liability is reevaluated on a quarterly basis 
experience has shown that initial data for a new product can be very volatile due to factors such as product and component failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs in correcting product failures  therefore our process relies upon long term historical averages until sufficient data is available 
as actual experience becomes available  it is used to modify the historical averages to ensure that the forecast is within the range of likely outcomes 
the resulting balances are then compared to current spending rates to ensure that the accruals are adequate to meet expected future obligations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when four criteria are met i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the sales price is fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue generating transactions generally fall into one of the following categories of revenue recognition we recognize product revenue at the time of shipment for substantially all products sold directly to customers and through distributors because title and risk of loss pass on delivery to the common carrier 
our customers and distributors do not have the right to return products 
if title and risk of loss pass at some other point in time  we recognize such revenue for our customers when the product is delivered to the customer and title and risk of loss has passed 

table of contents we recognize installation and service and maintenance revenue at the time the service is performed 
we recognize revenue associated with extended maintenance agreements emas over the life of the contracts using the straight line method  which approximates the expected timing in which applicable services are performed 
amounts collected in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as a current or long term liability based on the time from the balance sheet date to the future date of revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue on certain rental programs over the life of the rental agreement using the straight line method 
amounts collected in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as a current or long term liability based on the time from the balance sheet date to the future date of revenue recognition 
shipping costs reimbursed by the customer are included in revenue 
multiple element arrangements meas 
arrangements to sell products to customers frequently include multiple deliverables 
our most significant meas include the sale of one or more of our cleansource ups or powerhouse products  combined with one or more of the following products design services  project management  commissioning and installation services  spare parts or consumables  and ema s 
delivery of the various products or performance of services within the arrangement may or may not coincide 
certain services related to design and consulting may occur prior to delivery of product and commissioning and installation typically take place within months of product delivery  depending upon customer requirements 
emas  consumables  and repair  maintenance or consulting services generally are delivered over a period of one to five years 
in certain arrangements revenue recognized is limited to the amount invoiced or received that is not contingent on the delivery of future products and services 
when arrangements outside of the scope of software revenue recognition guidance include multiple elements  we allocate revenue to each element based on the relative selling price and recognize revenue when the elements have standalone value and the four criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element 
we establish the selling price of each element based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available  third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available  or best estimate of selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
we generally determine selling price based on amounts charged separately for the delivered and undelivered elements to similar customers in standalone sales of the specific elements 
when arrangements include an ema  we recognize revenue related to the ema at the stated contractual price on a straight line basis over the life of the agreement 
any taxes imposed by governmental authorities on our revenue producing transactions with customers are shown in our consolidated statement of operations on a net basis  that is excluded from our reported revenues stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation using a fair value based recognition method 
stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  expected option life and forfeiture rates 
we develop our estimates based on historical data and market information that can change significantly over time 
a small change in estimates used can have a relatively large change in the estimated valuation 
we use the black scholes option valuation model to value employee stock awards 
we estimate stock price volatility based upon our historical volatility 
estimated option life and forfeiture rate assumptions are derived from historical data 
for stock based compensation awards with graded vesting  we recognize compensation expense using the straight line amortization method 
results of operations comparison of to product revenue product revenue primarily consists of sales of our cleansource power quality products  cps and our data center containerized infrastructure solutions 
our cleansource power quality products are comprised of both ups and dc product lines and our cps solutions are comprised of our ups systems and some combination of third party ancillary equipment  such as engine generators and switchgear 
the cps products may be sold in a containerized solution that we call powerhouse  or as separate equipment 
our data center containerized infrastructure solutions provide power distribution  cooling capabilities  security systems  fire suppression and monitoring capabilities for our it channel partners 

table of contents the following table summarizes for the periods indicated  a year over year comparison of our product revenue in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change our product revenue represented and of total revenue for and  respectively 
our product revenue was derived from the following sources in thousands change from prior year percent change product revenue ups product revenue continuous power systems data center infrastructure solutions total product revenue the growth of our product revenue in came from the sale of cps models  including powerhouse  as our solutions have gained market acceptance 
we were able to significantly increase volume for these products through our it channel partners and also with our direct sales organization  particularly in the european and asian markets 
we have been able to capitalize on an emerging trend of modularized data center solutions  where our cps systems are able to offer higher power density and lower operating costs to provide a complimentary power and infrastructure solution for it companies when they sell such modularized products 
we introduced the containerized data center infrastructure solutions during as a way to provide complimentary products for  and to help in sale of our powerhouse products into the modular data center market 
we have also been successful at selling our powerhouse product directly to military  utility and data center customers during our efforts to grow cps and infrastructure solution sales reflects our strategy of focusing on selling total solutions and not just ups products to our customers 
offsetting this increase in sales of our cps and infrastructure products  we have experienced a decline in sales of our ups products in we had an absence of large ups only orders in from hyper scale it and collocation customers who had purchased large volumes of ups products directly from us in  particularly in the north american market that caused a decrease in ups product revenues 
we also saw a decline in sales volume from our oem partners who historically have been our largest customer of ups systems 
we anticipate improved sales from hyper scale it and collocation customers in which will drive an increase in our ups revenues 
in we sold flywheel product units  a slight decrease from the units sold in  reflecting the lower volume of ups products in the average selling price per flywheel unit decreased to  in compared to approximately  in  due to the lower volume of wheels sold through our direct sales channel 
we typically generate higher prices and profit margins from our direct sales compared to sales made through our oem channel as we do not have to offer channel discounts on our direct sales 
in  we delivered a total of megawatts of critical power systems  which generated approximately  in revenue per megawatt of critical power delivered 
this compares to megawatts of critical power systems delivered in  which generated approximately  in revenue per megawatt 
the decrease in megawatts of critical power delivered reflects the lower volume of ups products delivered 
the increase in dollar per megawatt delivered reflects the relatively larger sales transactions of cps systems in  which generate more revenue per megawatt of critical power delivered  compared to ups systems only 
our cps and infrastructure products tend to be larger in value and from a smaller number of customers compared to sales of our ups products 
this smaller number of customers with greater transaction value can contribute to large quarterly fluctuations in revenue from each product family  due to the timing of orders and shipments in any particular accounting period 
individual cps sales have been as high as million in  as we have delivered multiple cps products to single customers and our single largest order for containerized infrastructure products was over million in a small number of transactions can therefore lead to significant revenue  but cause greater volatility in our quarterly results and increase liquidity risk for us as we continue to refine and improve the payment terms of these opportunities as part of our working capital management 
we expect revenue to grow in coming years from current and future customers as modular data center infrastructure continues to gain acceptance in the market 

table of contents product sales from our oem channels  which were primarily from the sale of ups systems  represented of our total revenue for compared to in sales of our ups products are a much smaller part of our oem partner s total business and subject to more volatility in quarterly sales  particularly during difficult economic periods as the oem partners focus on their core business 
in we have seen fewer number of transactions  but larger value transactions from our oem channel 
product revenue from our oem channels decreased by in relative to  after increasing by in compared to  reflecting decreased performance from our oem partner 
we have supported our oem partners efforts to sell total solutions to their customers that include generators and switchgear that they manufacture along with our ups systems as a total solution 
if our oem partners are successful with this strategy  we believe that it will help drive an increase in our ups product revenue 
however  as our oem partners sell more solutions  quarterly revenue becomes more variable 
caterpillar remains one of our largest customers as well as our largest oem customer 
product sales from our it channel partners represented of our product revenues for compared to of product revenues in this growth reflects the increased sales of cps and infrastructure solutions during by our it channel partners for their end customers 
north america sales were of our total revenue for  compared to for our north america sales increased by in compared to  primarily as a result of lower ups systems revenue and the decrease in sales from our oem channels  which was offset by the continued growth in sales of our cps and data center infrastructure solutions 
we also sell products directly to customers in asia and europe and we have a network of international distributors in other territories to sell our products 
in these markets  customers are more likely to purchase a total power solution such as powerhouse from us rather than a stand alone ups system 
this usually results in a longer selling cycle and makes quarterly results from these regions more inconsistent and dependent upon a smaller number of larger value transactions 
thus the amount of revenue from our international markets can fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis  but continue to increase when evaluated on an annual basis 
our sales in europe increased by in to million as we continue to expand our sales force and operations  particularly in germany and the uk where we have had success selling cps solutions into the data center market 
our sales in asia increased by in to million  which increase primarily consists of increasing powerhouse sales in china 
china represents the second largest ups market in the world and has the potential to become a substantial market for our products 
over time we anticipate increasing sales of our ups systems as well as our cps solutions in china 
we have historically experienced a lag between adding sales and service capabilities and generating meaningful revenue from a new territory 
as a result  we would expect that the investments that we have made during the last few years in europe and asia will generate higher revenues from these regions in we continue to invest in sales  service and marketing capabilities in each of these regions as well as building brand awareness for our company and products globally 
we expect that a significant portion of our total revenue will continue to be derived from international sales 
sales of active power branded products through our direct and manufacturer s representative channels represented of our product revenue for  compared to for as direct sales typically have higher profit margins than sales through our oem and it channels  we will continue to focus on building our direct sales channel to increase revenue and improve profit margins and to decrease our dependency upon any particular channel partner 
we believe sales of our active power branded products in markets that were not covered by our oems will continue to increase over time and will continue to become a larger percentage of our total revenue 
our products perform well in harsh environments where power quality or reliability is particularly poor  which makes them a good fit for countries with a poor power infrastructure or in harsh manufacturing or process environments  or situations where reliability is paramount  such as mission critical business applications  particularly data center applications 
therefore we have traditionally focused our direct sales efforts on these types of customer situations 
service and other revenue service and other revenue primarily relates to revenue generated from both traditional after market service work and from customer specific system engineering 
this includes revenue from design  installation  startup  repairs or reconfigurations of our products and the sale of spare or replacement parts to our oem and end user customers 
it also includes revenue associated with the costs of travel of our service personnel and revenues or fees received upon contract deferment or cancellation 
revenue from extended maintenance contracts with our customers is also included in this revenue category 
the following table summarizes for the periods indicated a year over year comparison of our service and other revenue in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change 
table of contents service and other revenue increased by for  compared to this increase is primarily due to higher levels of service and contract work from direct product sales and from professional fees associated with powerhouse and other cps sales 
for these customers we provide a full power solution  including site preparation  installation of an entire power solution and provision of all products required to provide a turnkey product to the end user often including maintenance services 
we also had increased service revenues from maintenance contracts and repair related activities as our increasing install base of ups customers provides greater opportunities to generate such revenues 
in situations where we make sales through our oem channel  it is typical for the oem to provide these types of services to their end user customers directly  so these revenue sources do not exist on our oem sales 
we anticipate that service and other revenue will continue to grow with product revenue  particularly as our powerhouse system revenue grows  and as our installed base of ups product expands  because as more units are sold to customers  more installation  startup and maintenance services will be required 
cost of product revenue cost of product revenue includes the cost of component parts of our products  ancillary equipment that is sourced from external suppliers  personnel  equipment and other costs associated with our assembly and test operations  including costs from having underutilized facilities  depreciation of our manufacturing property and equipment  shipping costs  warranty costs  and the costs of manufacturing support functions such as logistics and quality assurance 
the following table summarizes for the periods indicated  a year over year comparison of our cost of product revenue in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change gross margin the increase in cost of product revenue compares to the increase in product revenues that we experienced in this disparity reflects the higher relative cost and lower margin on our cps and infrastructure products that we have historically experienced 
cost of product revenue also included  and  of stock based compensation expense in and  respectively 
the cost of product revenue as a percentage of total product revenue was in  as compared to for this increase in cost as a percentage of revenue compared to reflects the impact of sales product mix and the higher levels of unabsorbed overhead costs attributable to a lower level of ups system production 
we continue to operate a manufacturing facility that has a manufacturing and testing capacity significantly greater than our current product revenue levels 
we continue to work on reducing our product costs through design enhancements and modifications  and vendor management programs and increasing our sales volume to absorb these expenses 
our margins on cps and infrastructure solutions sales are lower compared to the margins realized on our ups sales because we realize lower margins on the third party equipment that we purchase and include in our cps and containerized product offerings 
we do not yet have a consistent volume of quarterly business from these newer product offerings that would enable us to realize benefits from economies of scale  standardization of design  planning and purchasing  which we believe will lead to higher margins in the future for these products 
however  we continue to implement our strategy to improve the profitability of individual transactions and the profitability of the company as a whole 
we believe that as our direct sales of cps and infrastructure solutions and our total revenues continue to increase  our product margins will continue to improve  in part to the scale  efficiency and evolving standardization of these products and from improved revenue management for customization of products for customers 
during we also invested in additional dedicated facilities to support our cps and infrastructure solutions that will facilitate more efficient manufacturing and allow us to support further growth in this business 
we have also continued to improve the efficiency and utilization of our manufacturing facility  which has a large portion of fixed costs 
we incur approximately million per year in fixed costs for our manufacturing facility that has a capacity in excess of our current business requirements 
we expense the excess costs of the underutilization of this facility as part of our cost of product revenues 
we now produce more goods with less overhead than in previous years 
some of this efficiency is driven by higher product volumes that allow for better utilization of our test facility and our manufacturing space 
we also have ongoing programs within our engineering and manufacturing departments to lower product costs  to identify alternative and cheaper vendors if possible  without impacting quality levels  to reduce our absolute level of overhead spending and headcount  and to improve the manufacturability of our products 
we have also been able to utilize ups manufacturing personnel in the manufacture of our powerhouse and infrastructure solution products  which has further improved the efficiency of our manufacturing operations 
for  we anticipate further cost reductions from these ongoing programs 

table of contents cost of service and other revenue cost of service and other revenue includes the cost of component parts that we use in service or sell as spare parts  as well as labor and overhead costs of our service organization  including travel and related costs incurred in fulfilling our service obligations to our customers and the costs of third party contractors used in completion of some of our professional services 
the following table summarizes for the periods indicated a year over year comparison of our cost of service and other revenue in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change gross margin the cost of service and other revenue increased by in while our service and other revenues increased by 
as a percentage of service and other revenues  our costs were of revenue in  compared to in this increase in the cost of service and other revenue was primarily due to lower margins realized in europe for design  installation and project management on a number of large cps system sales in additionally  we continue to expand our service team to broaden the geographic regions where we have service capability as our total business grows 
operationally  we are challenged to manage the growth of our service organization so that it scales with the growth in total revenues so that we can meet customer requirements without growing our service organization cost structure too rapidly 
the utilization of our service personnel will also be affected by the number of powerhouse and infrastructure solution products implemented in a particular period and in periods where we have a low number of installation projects  our costs as a percentage of revenue would be expected to increase 
a large portion of the costs involved in operating our service organization are fixed in nature and we incur approximately  to  in unabsorbed overhead each quarter 
we continue to work on reducing our service overhead through better utilization of our service employees and cost control measures 
this infrastructure also means that we can leverage this investment and grow our service capabilities substantially by adding direct technical labor only as required 
we also are developing more experience and expertise in the deployment of our cps and infrastructure solutions as this business grows  which we believe we can leverage into improved margins and lower costs for us 
gross profit the following table summarizes for the periods indicated a year over year comparison of our gross profit in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change gross margin the decrease in gross profit margin in compared to reflects the impact of an increase in sales of our cps and infrastructure products as a percentage of our total revenue and the decline in our ups systems revenue 
generally  we realize lower margins on our cps and infrastructure products than sales of our ups products because they include a higher proportion of third party ancillary equipment that we are not able to resell at margins that are comparable to our ups products 
a change in sales mix driven by an increase in revenues from these lower margin products as a percentage of total revenues will result in a lower gross profit for our business 
our margins were also negatively impacted by lower margins on professional services in europe related to cps system installation and management  and from higher unabsorbed overhead costs from our manufacturing operations due to lower ups product revenue 
our costs for manufacturing infrastructure products did increase faster than our ability to increase revenue from these products in  resulting in lower product margins compared to for this revenue source 
our ability to improve our gross profit will depend  in part  on our ability to continue to reduce material costs for all of our products  improve our sales channel mix in favor of direct sales versus oem sales  increase sales of higher margin products such as our ups products  increase product prices where necessary  improve our professional service margins through pricing and operating efficiency  and increase our total revenues to a level that will allow us to improve the utilization of our manufacturing and service operations 

table of contents research and development research and development expense primarily consists of compensation and related costs for employees engaged in research  development and engineering activities  third party consulting and development activities  as well as an allocated portion of our occupancy costs 
the following table summarizes for the periods indicated  a year over year comparison of our research and development expense in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change overall our research and development expenses were approximately million  or  higher in compared to we are currently developing a next generation of ups product that we believe will offer greater power modularity and space efficiencies compared to our existing ups products  especially as we target the higher power market segments 
we have increased headcount to support this new product development and to support new infrastructure and cps products that we believe will contribute to future revenue growth for us 
it is anticipated that the new ups product line will allow improved profit margins and provide a larger addressable market for our ups systems business 
our research and development efforts in were largely focused on new configurations of our existing flywheel technology  as well as refinements and enhancements to the standardization of our powerhouse and containerized infrastructure solution products 
research and development expenses included approximately  and  of stock based compensation expense in and  respectively 
we anticipate our research and development expenditures in will increase compared to as we finalize development of our next generation ups products and as we broaden our product portfolio  but will decrease as a percentage of sales in the future as our revenues grow 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expense primarily consists of compensation  including variable sales compensation  and related costs  for sales and marketing personnel  and related travel  selling and marketing expenses  compensation paid to resellers and agents  as well as an allocated portion of our occupancy costs and the cost of our foreign sales operations 
the following table summarizes for the periods indicated  a year over year comparison of our selling and marketing expense in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change selling and marketing costs were approximately  or  higher in compared to the increase from reflects higher salary costs as a result of an increase in headcount for our direct sales organization in the us offset  in part  by lower variable sales compensation due to our lower gross margins 
the increase also reflects increased headcount as we focus on marketing efforts on building and improving the active power brand and expanding our sales organization  particularly in europe and asia  to support our direct selling and channel sales activities 
we added specific sales resources to support each of our oem and it sales channels during and  which we believe contributed to the improved performance from each of these channels 
we also incurred additional expenses of approximately  related to the closing of our office in japan in december selling and marketing expenses also include approximately  and  of stock based compensation expense in and  respectively 
we anticipate that our selling and marketing expenses will continue to increase as our revenues grow  due to higher variable compensation expense  and as we continue to invest in marketing to grow our global brand awareness 
general and administrative general and administrative expense is primarily comprised of compensation and related costs for board  executive and administrative personnel  professional fees  and taxes  including sales  property and franchise taxes and the allowance for doubtful accounts expense 
the following table summarizes for the periods indicated  a year over year comparison of our selling  general and administrative expense in thousands 
table of contents year annual amount change from prior year percent change general and administrative expenses for increased approximately  or  compared to this increase primarily reflects costs incurred of approximately  related to the separation of employment of our former chief executive officer in october and for costs incurred in our efforts to hire a new chief executive officer 
general and administrative expenses also included approximately  and  in stock based compensation expense in and  respectively 
we anticipate that the level of general and administrative expenses in should remain at similar levels to those in absent the costs associated with the change in personnel 
interest expense  net the following table summarizes the yearly changes in our interest expense income in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change the increase in net interest expense in primarily reflects lower interest income earned on lower interest rates as well as higher interest expense as we had a larger average outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility in we negotiated a million revolving credit facility with our bank in august that incurs a minimum monthly interest charge that also resulted in higher interest expense 
our average cash and investments balance over has increased by million  or  compared to the average balance over  reflecting the million in borrowing under our revolving line of credit in other income expense  net other income expense in the years ended and reflects foreign exchange gains losses on a bank account held in foreign currencies by our subsidiary companies 
income tax expense due to operating losses  we have not recorded any income tax expenses  other than minimum or statutory costs 
during we recorded a net tax benefit due to certain tax credits that we earned 
as of december   our accumulated net operating loss carryforward was million and our research and development credit carry forwards were million 
we anticipate that these loss carry forward amounts may offset future taxable income that we may achieve and future tax liabilities 
however  because of uncertainty regarding our ability to use these carry forwards and the potential limitations due to ownership changes  we have established a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax assets comparison of to product revenue product revenue represented and of total revenue for and  respectively 
the majority of our product revenue growth in came from the sale of our cps and infrastructure solutions 
we were able to significantly increase volume for these products through our it channel partners and also with our direct sales organization  particularly in the north american market 
we introduced the containerized data center infrastructure solutions during as a way to provide complimentary products for  and to help in sale of our powerhouse products into the modular data center market 
we have also been successful at selling our powerhouse product directly to military  utility and data center customers during our efforts to grow cps and infrastructure solution sales reflects our strategy of focusing on selling total solutions and not just ups products to our customers 
this strategy has also led to a decrease in the growth in ups products compared to our other product categories 
product sales from our it channel partners represented of our product revenues for compared to of product revenues in this growth reflects the increased sales of cps and infrastructure solutions during by our it channel partners for their end customers 
product sales from our oem channels represented of our total revenue for compared to in and are primarily from the sale of ups systems 
the decrease in the percentage of total revenues derived from our oem channels occurred despite an actual increase in sales by our oem partners  as our it channel and direct sales businesses grew at much faster rates 
product revenue from our oem channels increased by in over  after declining by in compared to  reflecting improved performance from our oem channel 

table of contents north america sales were of our total revenue for  compared to for in total  our north america sales increased by in compared to  reflecting the overall growth in the market for our products in total and in particular for our data center infrastructure solutions and the improvement in overall market conditions within the us data center market 
our sales in europe increased by in to million as we continue to expand our sales force and operations in germany and the uk in particular 
our sales in asia increased by in to million  highlighted by stronger powerhouse sales in china 
in august we opened our first sales office in china as part of our effort to add sales and service capabilities to this market 
service and other revenue service and other revenue increased by for  compared to this increase is primarily due to higher levels of service and contract work from direct product sales and from professional fees associated with powerhouse and other cps sales 
we also had increased service revenues from maintenance contracts and repair related activities as our increasing install base of ups customers provides greater opportunities to generate such revenues 
cost of product revenue the increase in cost of product revenue from to was driven by the increase in product revenues that we experienced in  as well as our continuous cost reduction efforts 
cost of product revenue also included  and  of stock based compensation expense in and  respectively 
the cost of product revenue as a percentage of total product revenue was in  as compared to for this decrease in cost as a percentage of revenue compared to is due primarily to increased sales volumes  which resulted in more efficient utilization of our manufacturing facility and a lower level of unabsorbed overhead costs 
we have been able to improve our gross product margins by increasing the average selling price of our products that we sell as well as by lowering our product cost 
this has been partially offset by the impact of increased sales of our cps  such as powerhouse 
we also have ongoing programs within our engineering and manufacturing departments to lower product costs  to identify alternative and cheaper vendors if possible  without impacting quality levels  to reduce our absolute level of overhead spending and headcount  and to improve the manufacturability of our products 
during these efforts have helped reduce our cost of product revenue in spite of the pressures of higher raw material and commodity price increases 
we have also been able to utilize manufacturing personnel in the manufacture of our powerhouse and infrastructure solution products  which has further improved the efficiency of our manufacturing operations 
cost of service and other revenue the cost of service and other revenue increased by in compared to while our service and other revenues increased by 
as a percentage of service and other revenues  our costs were of revenue in  compared to in this increase reflects higher costs relative to the increase in service and other revenues as we continue to expand our service team to broaden the geographic regions where we have service capability as our total business grows 
gross profit the increase in our gross profit for relative to was primarily driven by the increase in total revenues  higher average selling prices for all of our products  and better utilization of our manufacturing capacity  which resulted in lower unabsorbed overhead costs 
the introduction and higher sales of new products such as the data center infrastructure solutions also generated higher absolute profits than sales of ups systems because of the higher transaction values 

table of contents research and development our research and development efforts in were largely focused on new configurations of our existing flywheel technology  as well as refinements and enhancements to the standardization of our powerhouse and containerized infrastructure solution products 
during a number of our engineering employees also worked directly on specific customer projects for customization and enhancement of modular products  and  of research and development expenses were charged to cost of product revenues to reflect the time and expense incurred in generating such revenues 
absent this  our research and development costs would have decreased by  or 
this decrease in spending compared to reflected lower project related development costs in as well as lower headcount costs 
expenses in also included higher prototype and development costs from paralleling our megawatt class ups products 
research and development expenses included approximately  and  of stock based compensation expense in and  respectively 
selling and marketing the increase in selling and marketing expense in relative to primarily reflects higher variable sales compensation  including payments made to third party representatives  and performance based compensation as a result of higher revenue and improved results 
the increase also reflected increased headcount as we focus on building and improving the active power brand and expanding our sales organization  particularly in europe and asia  to support our direct selling and channel sales activities

income tax expense due to operating losses  we have not recorded any income tax expenses  other than minimum or statutory costs 
during we recorded a net tax benefit due to certain tax credits that we earned 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity at december  are our cash and investments on hand  our bank credit facilities and projected cash flows from operating activities 
if we meet our cash flow projections in our current business plan  we expect that we have adequate capital resources in order to continue operating our business for at least the next months 
our business plan and our assumptions around the adequacy of our liquidity are based on estimates regarding expected revenues and future costs 
however  there are scenarios in which our revenues may not meet our projections  our costs may exceed our estimates or our working capital needs may be greater than anticipated 
further  our estimates may change and future events or developments may also affect our estimates 
any of these factors may change our expectation of cash usage in and beyond or significantly affect our level of liquidity 
in august  we entered into a second amended and restated loan and security agreement the loan agreement with our existing bank  silicon valley bank svb which increased the total availability from million to million subject to certain borrowing bases 
this facility expanded our ability to borrow funds from us receivables to include qualifying receivables from our uk operations as well  increased our ability to use inventory as collateral  and also added an ability to borrow against purchase orders 
these additional bases of borrowing were designed to allow us to use the credit facility to fund inventory purchases in the event we received large or multiple sales orders that would require a major investment in inventory and work in progress such as our powerhouse and infrastructure solutions business  to help fund continued growth in our business and to manage our working capital requirements 

table of contents this two year loan facility provides for a secured revolving line of credit in an aggregate amount of up to eighty percent of the facility amount of million  or million  subject to certain borrowing bases 
in the event we have maintained unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of at least million with svb for at least consecutive days  which is referred to as being in a streamline period  the borrowing base formula is based on eligible accounts receivable  eligible purchase orders and eligible inventory  subject to a sublimit of million for uk accounts receivable  million for inventory and million for purchase orders 
when we are not in a streamline period  our borrowings are limited based on accounts receivable and purchase orders that svb has specifically agreed to finance and a borrowing base for eligible inventory 
we may also request that svb issue letters of credit on our behalf  of up to million  as a portion of our total loan facility 
on august   we borrowed approximately million in revolving loans  all of which was used to refinance all indebtedness owing from the company to svb under our previous credit facility 
the credit facility increases the total credit available from our previous loan facility with svb  which was million  and enables us to borrow against eligible inventory  foreign receivables and customer purchase orders in addition to eligible accounts receivable 
during  we have borrowed amounts under this credit facility based on our short term liquidity requirements 
based on the borrowing base formula  we had an additional million available for use at december  under this credit facility 
when a streamline period is in effect  each advance based upon accounts receivable and inventory accrues interest at a per annum rate equal to svb s prime rate  subject to a minimum prime rate of four percent  plus one and one half percent and each advance based upon a purchase order inventory accrues interest at a per annum rate equal to svb s prime rate  subject to a minimum prime rate of four percent  plus two percent 
when a streamline period is not in effect  each advance based upon accounts receivable and inventory accrues interest at a per annum rate equal to svb s prime rate  subject to a minimum prime rate of four percent  plus three and five eighths percent and each advance based upon a purchase order accrues interest at a per annum rate equal to svb s prime rate  subject to a minimum prime rate of four percent  plus six and one half percent 
finance charges and interest are payable monthly  and all principal and interest is due on the maturity date of august  however  when we are not in a streamline period  we must repay advances based on receivables when we receive payment on the receivable that has been financed  and we must repay advances based on purchase orders within days of the date of the purchase order  together with all finance charges on such advances 
the revolving loans made to us under this loan facility are secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets 
in addition  on august   active power solutions limited  a wholly owned united kingdom subsidiary of the company  entered into a guarantee and debenture with svb the guarantee and debenture  pursuant to which active power solutions limited guarantied all of the obligations of the company under the loan agreement and secured its obligations under the guarantee and debenture with a security interest on substantially all of its assets 
the loan agreement includes customary affirmative covenants for a credit facility of this size and type  including delivery of financial statements  compliance with laws  maintenance of insurance and protection of intellectual property rights 
further  the loan agreement contains customary negative covenants for a credit facility of this size and type  including covenants that limit or restrict our ability  among other things  to dispose of assets  change our business  change our ceo or cfo without replacing such person within days  have a change in control  make acquisitions  be acquired  incur indebtedness  grant liens  make investments  make distributions  repurchase stock  and enter into certain transactions with affiliates 
the loan agreement also requires the company to maintain a minimum liquidity ratio of the liquidity ratio is defined as the ratio of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities plus eligible accounts receivable to all indebtedness owed by the company to svb 
the company is currently in compliance with all loan covenants under the loan agreement 

table of contents the loan agreement contains customary events of default that include  among other things  non payment defaults  covenant defaults  material adverse change defaults  insolvency defaults  material judgment defaults and inaccuracy of representations and warranty defaults 
the occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of obligations under the loan agreement  in which case the company must repay all loans and related charges  fees and amounts then due and payable  and our subsidiary may be required to pay any such amounts under the guarantee and debenture 
at the election of svb  upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default  finance charges or interest rates  as applicable  will increase an additional five percentage points per annum above the rate that is otherwise applicable thereto upon the occurrence of such event of default  and the collateral handling fees will increase by one half percent 
a substantial increase in sales of our powerhouse or our infrastructure solutions products or a substantial increase in ups sales may materially impact the amount of liquidity required to fund our operations 
the amount of time between the receipt of payment from our customers and our expenditures for raw materials  manufacturing and shipment of products the cash cycle for sales of our cleansource ups product can be as short as days  and is typically days 
however  the cash cycle on a powerhouse sale can be as much as days  depending upon customer payment terms 
we intend to mitigate the financial impact of this longer cash cycle by requiring customer deposits and periodic payments where possible from our customers 
this is not always commercially feasible  and in order to increase our powerhouse sales  we may be required to make larger investments in inventory and receivables 
these larger investments may require us to obtain additional sources of working capital  debt or equity financing in order to fund this business 
should additional funding be required or desirable  we would expect to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt or equity securities  the ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted 
if we obtain additional debt financing  a substantial portion of our operating cash flow may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness  and the terms of the debt securities issued could impose significant restrictions on our operations 
we do not know whether we will be able to secure additional funding  or funding on terms acceptable to us  to continue our operations as planned 
if financing is not available  we may be required to reduce  delay or eliminate certain activities or to license or sell to others some of our proprietary technology 
significant uses of cash operating activities the following table summarizes the yearly changes in cash provided by used in operating activities in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change cash used in operating activities was million in compared to cash provided by operating activities of million in  a decrease of million 
this change in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to the million increase in our operating losses and due to changes in current assets and current liabilities  or our net working capital 
changes in our net working capital  resulted in cash used of million in  compared to cash provided from such working capital of million in cash used in operating activities in included approximately million in costs attributable to the departure of our chief executive officer and costs associated with closure of certain foreign operations 
as our business continues to grow  we have had to finance a larger level of inventory and receivables to support this higher level of activity  particularly with our powerhouse and infrastructure solutions which have a much longer construction time than our ups business and are typically larger in value 
our receivables decreased by million or during  offset by an increase in inventory of million in and a decrease in accounts payable of million 
these changes reflect the frequent changes in our working capital that can result in very large fluctuation in inventory  payables and receivables  even weekly  based on the large size of some of our orders 
on an annual basis  the decrease in trade payables and the increase in inventory were offset by the decrease in receivables 

table of contents our top five customers represented of our total revenue during in addition  as of december   our five largest receivables were of our total receivables 
as a result of this customer concentration  our failure to collect receivables from any of these customers in a timely manner could have a significant adverse effect on our liquidity 
this risk may potentially increase as we sell more powerhouse products due to their higher average selling price 
we do continue to request deposits and periodic payments from large customers where commercially possible  particularly for projects with multiple deliverables 
however  the amount of such advance payments can fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis  depending on the size and scope of customer orders at any point in time 
as a result  we will need to continue to focus on management of cash and working capital in in order to manage the level of funds we use in our operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities was 
million in compared to cash used in operating activities of million in this change in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to lower operating losses 
in addition  changes in our net working capital  resulted in cash provided of million in  compared to cash provided from such working capital of million in investing activities investing activities primarily consist of sales and purchases of investments and purchases of property and equipment 
fluctuations in the sale and purchase of investments generally reflect our use of these investment funds to finance our ongoing operations 
the cash used in investing activities increased from million in to million in as we had less short term investments available to liquidate to fund our business and due to increased capital expenditures in as we supported our sales and marketing programs with powerhouse demonstration units in the us  china and germany 
capital expenditures increased in from by approximately million 
this increase primarily related to purchasing of equipment to support our sales and marketing activities 
we historically invested in our manufacturing infrastructure and  because we have a production capacity in excess of our current revenue level we can substantially increase our production levels without needing to make any material capital investments 
our capital expenditures therefore will primarily support expansion of our sales and service capabilities and our marketing and administrative efforts as required 
financing activities funds provided by financing activities during reflect the draw on our revolving line of credit of million and proceeds from employee stock purchases 
funds provided by financing activities in primarily reflect the sale of common stock by the company 
in february we sold approximately million shares of common stock in a firm commitment underwritten offering at a purchase price of per share  for proceeds  net of fees and expenses  of million 
we expect the level of capital investments to decrease in compared to contractual obligations in our day to day operations  we incur commitments to make future payments for goods and services 
these arise from entering into operating leases and as we make commitments to vendors to provide us materials and services 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments at december  in thousands payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term obligations 
table of contents our principal lease commitments consist of our leases for our corporate headquarters and engineering and administration facilities and our global sales offices 
in  we entered into a secured revolving line of credit facility of up to million  subject to a borrowing base formula  with svb 
this facility was modified in to increase the limit to million 
in august  we entered into a second amended and restated loan and security agreement with svb 
this new credit facility increased the total liquidity available from million to million subject to certain borrowing bases 
there was million and million outstanding under this facility at december  and  respectively 
future uses of cash we believe that our cash and investments  projected cash flows from operations and sources of available liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
our cash cycle is such that we generally have visibility two to three quarters in advance for future orders that allows us to predict revenues over this period of time with some degree of confidence 
however  a sudden change in business volume  positive or negative  from any of our business or channel partners or in our direct business or any customer driven events such as order or delivery deferral could significantly impact our expected revenues 
the recent global economic downturn has reduced our confidence at predicting future revenues  and even with improving economic conditions  there is still uncertainty and risk in our forecasting 
this two to three quarter window of sales visibility does provide us with some opportunity to adjust expenditures or take other measures to reduce our cash consumption if we can see and anticipate a shortfall in revenue or give us time to identify additional sources of funding if we anticipate an increase in our working capital requirements due to increased revenues or changes in our revenue mix 
a significant increase in sales  especially in our powerhouse or our infrastructure solutions business  would likely increase our working capital requirements  due to the longer production time and cash cycle of sales of these products 
we expect the level of capital investments to decrease in compared to primarily as a result of our investment in in powerhouse demonstration units for a number of our sales offices 
other factors that may affect liquidity beyond the next twelve months  our cash requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of sales growth  the market acceptance of our products  the gross profit we are able to generate with our sales  the timing and level of development funding  the rate of expansion of our sales and marketing activities  the rate of expansion of our manufacturing processes  and the timing and extent of research and development projects 
although we are not a party to any agreement or letter of intent with respect to a potential acquisition or merger  we may enter into acquisitions or strategic arrangements in the future to help accelerate our growth  which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
should additional funding be required or desirable  we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt or equity securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted 
if we obtain additional debt financing  a substantial portion of our operating cash flow may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness  and the terms of the debt securities issued could impose significant restrictions on our operations 
our existing bank facilities expire in october  although we believe that we will be able to extend or renew this facility on substantially similar terms to our current arrangement 
we do not know whether we will be able to secure additional funding  or funding on terms acceptable to us  to continue our operations as planned 
if financing is not available  we may be required to reduce  delay or eliminate certain activities or to license or sell to others some of our proprietary technology 
off balance sheet arrangements during the years ended december   and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
new accounting pronouncements on january   we adopted amendments to authoritative literature that modifies the revenue recognition guidance for establishing separate units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement and requires the allocation of arrangement consideration to each deliverable in the arrangement based on relative selling price of the elements 
the selling price for each deliverable is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available  third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available  or best estimate of selling price besp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
besp must be determined in a manner that is consistent with that used to determine the price to sell the specific elements on a standalone basis 
the authoritative literature permits prospective or retrospective adoption  and we elected prospective adoption 
other than the increased disclosure requirements of adoption of this policy  the adoption of these amendments did not change our units of accounting  allocation of arrangement consideration  or pattern or timing of revenue recognition 
it also did not have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows for the year ended december  
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  including bank time deposits  and taxable variable rate and fixed rate obligations of corporations  municipalities  and local  state and national government entities and agencies 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
we believe that our investment policy is conservative  both in terms of the average maturity of investments that we allow and in terms of the credit quality of the investments we hold 
because of the nature of the majority of our investments  we do not believe a decline in interest rates would have a material effect on our interest income or fair value of our investments 
our international sales were historically made in us dollars 
as we have increased sales in foreign markets and opened operations in multiple foreign countries  we have executed more transactions that are denominated in other currencies  primarily euro and british pounds 
those sales and expenses in currencies other than us dollars can result in translation gains and losses which have not been significant to date 
currently  we do not engage in hedging activities for our international operations other than an increasing amount of sales and support expenses being incurred in foreign currencies as a natural hedge 
however  recent volatility in currencies  particularly with the pound and euro  is increasing the amount of potential translation gains and losses and we may engage in hedging activities in the future to mitigate the risks caused by such currency volatility 
our international business is subject to the typical risks of any international business  including  but not limited to  the risks described in item a  risk factors 
accordingly  our future results could be materially harmed by the actual occurrence of any of these or other risks
