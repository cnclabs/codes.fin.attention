item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and item a risk factors of this document 
payment terms payment terms vary worldwide  depending on the arrangement 
generally  contract payment terms range from to days from the invoice date within north america and are typically limited to days in regions outside of north america 
a portion of the contracts with our government and public safety customers include implementation milestones  such as delivery  installation and system acceptance  which generally take to days to complete 
invoicing the customer is dependent on completion of the milestone 
we generally do not grant extended payment terms 
as required for competitive reasons  we may provide long term financing in connection with system purchases 
financing may cover all or a portion of the purchase price 
research and development we participate in very competitive industries with constant changes in technology 
throughout our history  we have relied  and continue to rely  primarily on our research and development r d programs for the development of new products  and on our production engineering capabilities for the improvement of existing products 
management believes  looking forward  that our commitment to r d programs are necessary to allow us to remain competitive 
r d expenditures relating to new product development or product improvement were billion in  and we continue to believe that a strong commitment to r d is required to drive long term growth 
as of december   approximately  professional employees were engaged in such r d activities for us 
regulatory matters the use of wireless voice  data and video communications systems requires radio spectrum  which is regulated by governmental agencies throughout the world 
in the us  the federal communications commission fcc and the national telecommunications and information administration ntia regulate spectrum use by non federal entities and federal entities  respectively 
similarly  countries around the world have one or more regulatory bodies that define and implement the rules for use of the radio spectrum  pursuant to their respective national laws and international coordination under the international telecommunications union itu 
consequently  our results could be positively or negatively affected by the rules and regulations adopted by the fcc  ntia or regulatory agencies in other countries from time to time 
the availability of additional radio spectrum may provide new business opportunities and the loss of available radio spectrum may result in the loss of business opportunities 
we manufacture and market products in spectrum bands already made available by regulatory bodies 
these include voice and data infrastructure  mobile radios and portable or handheld devices 
our products operate both on licensed and unlicensed spectrum 
as television transmission and reception technology transitions from analog to more efficient digital modes  various countries around the world are examining  and in some cases already pursuing  the redevelopment of portions of the television spectrum 
in the us  pursuant to federal legislation  analog television stations ceased operation in the broadcast television spectrum on june  as a result of this transition  mhz of spectrum historically used for broadcast television  now known as the mhz band  is being redeveloped and deployed for new uses the so called digital dividend spectrum  including broadband and narrowband wireless communications 
now that the mhz band spectrum is open nationwide  fcc records indicate that so far over public safety agencies throughout over states have been deploying narrowband operations at mhz and others are in the planning stages 
under rules adopted by the fcc  mhz of the mhz band already allocated by the fcc will support new public safety narrowband and broadband communications systems 
the public safety community is also seeking legislation from congress to obtain an additional mhz of dedicated spectrum in the mhz band d block 
if successful  the legislation would double the broadband mhz band spectrum dedicated for public safety 

table of contents the fcc is also making provisions for a mhz band nationwide public safety broadband network that may be built over the next years 
in may  the fcc issued conditional waiver grants to public safety agencies around the country to deploy mhz broadband systems 
thirty three additional waiver petitions are pending fcc decisions as of december several of the broadband waiver grantees also benefit from federal broadband technology opportunity policy btop grant funds issued by the ntia during in  we were awarded a million btop grant to deploy a broadband system in the greater san francisco bay area 
we are also working with a number of customers in other areas who received fcc conditional waivers to use the mhz broadband spectrum 
for example  during  we received an award to implement a mhz lte broadband system for the mississippi wireless communication commission 
public safety organizations and the fcc have endorsed the use of lte technology  a technology in which we are investing  for this broadband network 
in november  canada also released a consultation requesting input on making broadband spectrum available for public safety use in the mhz band 
all full power tv broadcasters in canada vacated the mhz band by august  during  the radio advisory board of canada rabc  an influential industry association  recommended that canadian decision makers harmonize the band with that in the us further decisions regarding broadband use in canada are expected to be released during internationally  the itu world radio conference wrc is being held in geneva during the first quarter of during this session  leaders from united nation member countries will consider a number of initiatives  including whether to allocate additional spectrum for commercial broadband use as well as whether to allocate spectrum dedicated for public safety broadband 
if the wrc agrees to consider spectrum for public safety broadband  studies would follow that would assess whether and how much spectrum is needed and recommendations for where in the spectrum range the spectrum should be allocated taking into account regional and global harmonization to the extent practicable 
the result could be future allocations for dedicated broadband spectrum for public safety which will provide opportunities for us in the future 
in addition  certain countries already have spectrum landscapes that would permit country administrations to allocate public safety spectrum today 
a wrc initiative can spur individual countries to act sooner  which may also create opportunities for our broadband solutions in the nearer term 
some of our operations use substances regulated under various federal  state  local and international laws governing the environment and worker health and safety  including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the ground  air and water  the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites 
certain of our products are subject to various federal  state  local and international laws governing chemical substances in electronic products 
intellectual property matters patent protection is extremely important to our operations 
we have an extensive us and international portfolio of patents relating to our products  systems  technologies and manufacturing processes  including research developments in scanning  information collection  mission critical two way radio communication  network communications and network management 
we have also filed additional patent applications in the us patent and trademark office  as well as in foreign patent offices 
we license some of our patents to third parties  but this revenue is not significant 
we are also licensed to use certain patents owned by others 
in particular  motorola solutions has a royalty free license under all of the patents and patent applications assigned to motorola mobility at the time of the separation of the two businesses 
royalty and licensing costs vary from year to year and are subject to the terms of the agreements and sales volumes of our products subject to licenses 
we actively participate in the development of open standards for interoperable  mission critical digital two way radio systems 
we have published our technology and licensed patents to signatories of the industry s two primary memorandums of understanding defined by the telecommunications industry association tia  project  european telecommunications standards institute etsi  and tetra 
notwithstanding the transfer of patents to motorola mobility  the expiration of certain patents and the resulting potential for increased competition for some of our products in the future  we believe that our remaining 
table of contents patent portfolio will continue to provide us with a competitive advantage in our core product areas 
furthermore  we believe we are not dependent upon a single patent or a few patents 
our success depends more upon our proprietary know how  innovative skills  technical competence and marketing abilities 
in addition  because of changing technology  our present intention is not to rely primarily on patents or other intellectual property rights to protect or establish our market position 
however  we plan to continue to litigate against competitors to enforce our intellectual property rights in certain technologies when attempts to negotiate mutually agreeable licenses are not successful 
patents and trademarks as of december   we owned approximately  patents in the us and in foreign countries 
as of december   we and our wholly owned subsidiaries had approximately  us and foreign patent applications pending 
these foreign patents and patent applications are mostly counterparts of our us patents 
during  we and our wholly owned subsidiaries were granted us patents and patents in other countries 
inventory  raw materials  right of return and seasonality our practice is to carry reasonable amounts of inventory to meet customers delivery requirements in a manner consistent with industry standards 
we provide custom products which require the stocking of inventories and large varieties of piece parts and replacement parts in order to meet delivery and warranty requirements 
to the extent our suppliers product life cycles are shorter than ours  stocking of lifetime buy inventories is required to meet long term warranty and contractual requirements 
in addition  replacement parts are stocked for delivery on customer demand within a short delivery cycle 
at december   our inventory balance decreased slightly compared to december  availability of materials and components required by the company is generally dependable  however  fluctuations in supply and market demand have caused and could cause selective shortages and affect results 
we currently procure certain materials and components from single source vendors 
a material disruption from a single source vendor may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
if certain single source suppliers were to become capacity constrained or insolvent  it could result in a reduction or interruption in supplies or an increase in the price of supplies and adversely impact our financial results 
natural gas  electricity and  to a lesser extent  oil are the primary sources of energy for our manufacturing operations 
each of these resources is currently in adequate supply for our operations 
in addition  the cost to operate our facilities and freight costs are dependent on world oil prices 
labor is generally available in reasonable proximity to our manufacturing facilities 
difficulties in obtaining any of the aforementioned resources or a significant cost increase could affect our financial results 
generally  our customer contracts do not include a right of return  other than for standard warranty provisions  however  certain distributor partners within the commercial enterprise markets do maintain limited stock rotation rights 
due to buying patterns in the markets we serve  sales tend to be somewhat higher in the fourth quarter 
environmental quality during  compliance with federal  state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  did not have a material effect on our capital expenditures  earnings or the competitive position of the company 
employees at december   we and our subsidiaries had approximately  employees  compared to  employees at december  approximately  employees transferred as part of the distribution of motorola mobility on january   and approximately  employees transferred with the sale of certain assets and liabilities of the networks business to nsn

table of contents item a risk factors we wish to caution the reader that the following important risk factors  and those risk factors described elsewhere in this report or in our other securities and exchange commission filings  could cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated in forward looking statements contained in this document and elsewhere 
these risks are not presented in order of importance or probability of occurrence 
the uncertainty of current economic and political conditions makes budgeting and forecasting very difficult and may reduce demand for our products 
current conditions in the domestic and world economies remain uncertain 
this is particularly true of us government customers budgetary conditions 
as a result of global economic conditions  us and european unemployment levels  the ongoing recession in europe and ongoing political conflicts in the middle east and elsewhere have created many economic and political uncertainties that have impacted worldwide markets 
as a result  it is difficult to estimate changes in various parts of the us and world economy  including the markets in which we participate 
components of our budgeting and forecasting are dependent upon estimates of demand for our products  the prevailing economic uncertainties render estimates of future income and expenditures difficult 
we have sizeable operations in europe  which have been and will be impacted by the ongoing financial situation in europe and the weakening euro 
we have engineering resources in israel that could be disrupted as a result of hostilities in the region 
we also sell our products and services throughout the middle east and demand for our products and services could be negatively impacted by political conflicts and hostilities in this region 
the potential for future unrest  terrorist attacks  increased global conflicts and the escalation of existing conflicts has created worldwide uncertainties that have negatively impacted  and may continue to negatively impact  demand for certain of our products 
we continue to face a number of risks related to current global economic conditions  including adverse credit conditions  low economic growth  risk of sovereign defaults and high levels of unemployment 
global economic conditions continue to be challenging for government and enterprise communications markets  as many economies and financial markets remain in a recession resulting from a number of factors  including adverse credit conditions  low economic growth rates  risk of sovereign defaults  particularly in certain european countries  continuing high rates of unemployment  reduced corporate capital spending and other factors 
economic growth in the us and many other countries has remained low and the length of time these adverse economic conditions may persist are unknown 
these global economic conditions have impacted and could continue to impact our business in a number of ways  including potential deferment or cancellation of purchases and orders by customers uncertainty about current and future global economic conditions may cause  and in some cases has caused businesses and governments to defer or cancel purchases in response to tighter credit and decreased cash availability and declining consumer confidence 
if future demand for our products declines due to global economic conditions  it will negatively impact our financial results 
customers inability to obtain financing to make purchases from motorola solutions and or maintain their business some of our customers require substantial financing  including public financing or government grants  in order to fund their operations and make purchases from us 
the inability of these customers to obtain sufficient credit or other funds to finance purchases of our products and or meet their payment obligations to us could have  and in some cases has had  a negative impact on our financial results 
in addition  if global economic conditions result in insolvencies for our customers  it will negatively impact our financial results 
requests by customers for vendor financing by motorola solutions certain of our customers  particularly  but not limited to  those who purchase large infrastructure systems  request that their suppliers provide financing in connection with equipment purchases or the provision of managed services 
in response to reduced tax revenue at the state and local government level and ongoing tightening of credit for certain customers  these types of requests have increased in volume and scope 
motorola solutions  particularly in its government and public safety business  but also in connection with its global services offering  has continued to provide customer financing in light of these requests 
a continuation of the credit market dislocation could force us to 
table of contents choose between further increasing our level of vendor financing or potentially losing sales to these customers  as some of our competitors  particularly in asia  have been more willing to provide vendor financing 
we also retain exposure to the credit quality of our customers who we finance 
negative impact from increased financial pressures on third party dealers  distributors and retailers we make sales in certain regions through third party dealers  distributors and retailers 
although many of these third parties have significant operations and maintain access to available credit  others are smaller and more likely to be impacted by the significant decrease in available credit that resulted from the financial crisis that continues today 
if credit pressures or other financial difficulties result in insolvency for important third parties and we are unable to successfully transition end customers to purchase our products from other third parties or from us directly  it may cause  and in some cases has caused  a negative impact on our financial results 
negative impact from increased financial pressures on key suppliers our ability to meet customers demands depends  in part  on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of quality materials  parts and components from our suppliers 
certain of our components are available only from a single source or limited sources 
if certain single source or limited source suppliers were to become capacity constrained or insolvent  it could result in a reduction or interruption in supplies or an increase in the price of supplies and negatively impact our financial results 
in addition  credit constraints at single source suppliers have resulted in accelerated payment of accounts payable by us  impacting our cash flow 
if this trend continues  it will continue to negatively impact our cash flow 
increased risk of financial counterparty failures could negatively impact our financial position we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our overall exposure to the effects of currency fluctuations on cash flows 
we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to these derivative financial instruments 
although the contracts are distributed among several leading financial institutions  all of whom presently have investment grade credit ratings  the default by one or more counterparty could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements 
returns on pension and retirement plan assets and interest rate changes could affect our earnings and cash flow in future periods we have large underfunded pension obligations  in part resulting from the fact that we typically retain all of the us pension liabilities and the majority of our non us pension liabilities following our divestitures  including the distribution of motorola mobility 
the funding position of our pension plans is affected by the performance of the financial markets  particularly the equity and debt markets  and the interest rates used to calculate our pension obligations for funding and expense purposes 
annual pension contributions are determined by government regulations and calculated based upon our pension funding status  interest rates  and other factors 
if the financial markets perform poorly  we could be and have been required to make additional large contributions 
the equity markets can be volatile  and therefore our estimate of future contribution requirements can change dramatically in relatively short periods of time 
similarly  changes in interest rates can affect our contribution requirements 
in a low interest rate environment like the one we are in  the likelihood of higher contributions in the future increases 
we have direct and indirect exposure to european sovereign and non sovereign debt  european markets in terms of our revenues and cash flows and to fluctuations in the euro 
we view our exposures to the euro as follows as of december  our cash and cash equivalents include approximately million of euro denominated currency our accounts receivables balance includes approximately million of euro denominated receivables we estimate that approximately of our total annual estimated sales are euro denominated company sponsored defined benefit plans have no material exposure to euro sovereign debt  approximately million exposure to euro corporate bonds  and approximately million to euro equity investments a significant devaluation of  or movement away from  the use of the euro could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our success depends in part on our timely introduction of new products and technologies and our results can be impacted by the effectiveness of our significant investments in new products and technologies 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and evolving industry standards 
we face intense competition in these markets and new products are expensive to develop and bring to market 
our success depends  in substantial part  on the timely and successful introduction of new products and upgrades of current products to comply with emerging industry standards and to address competing technological and product developments carried out by our competitors 
the research and development of new  technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation and investment  as well as the accurate anticipation of technology and market trends 
many of our products and systems are complex and we may experience delays in completing development and introducing new products or technologies in the future 
we may focus our resources on technologies that do not become widely accepted or are not commercially viable or involve compliance obligations with additional areas of regulatory requirements 
in addition  our products may contain defects or errors that are detected only after deployment 
if our products are not competitive or do not work properly  our business will suffer 
our results are subject to risks related to our significant investment in developing and introducing new products  such as integrated digital radios and integrated public safety systems 
these risks include among others i difficulties and delays in the development  production  testing and marketing of products  ii customer acceptance of products  iii the development of  approval of  and compliance with industry standards and regulatory requirements  iv the significant amount of resources we must devote to the development of new technologies  and v the ability to differentiate our products and compete with other companies in the same markets 
we are exposed to risks under large multi year system and managed services contracts that may negatively impact our business 
we enter into large multi year system contracts with large municipal  state  nation wide government and enterprise customers 
this exposes us to risks  including among others i the technological risks of such contracts  especially when the contracts involve new technology  and ii financial risks under these contracts  including the estimates inherent in projecting costs associated with large contracts and the related impact on operating results 
we are also facing increasing competition from traditional system integrators and the defense industry as system contracts become larger and more complicated 
political developments also can impact the nature and timing of large government contracts 
in addition  multi year awards from governmental customers may often only receive partial funding initially and may typically be cancellable on short notice with limited penalties 
the termination of funding for a government program would result in a loss of anticipated future revenue attributable to that program  which could have an adverse impact on our profitability 
in addition  we are increasingly providing managed services to our customers  particularly as we expand our global services organization  which requires that we partner with other systems and services providers  often on multi year projects  to design  construct  manage and operate a public safety system or other commercial system 
from time to time such projects may require that we form a joint venture with our partners 
such arrangements may require us to assume the risk and agree to specific performance metrics that meet the customer s requirement for network availability  reliability  maintenance and support 
in certain cases  if these performance metrics are not met we may not be paid 
depending on the nature of such projects  which are referred to as build own operate boo and in some cases maintain boom or transfer boot  we may be unable to recognize revenue from the sale of equipment for a period of time  which may be several years 
such boo  boom and boot arrangements shift risk to us and may result in an adverse impact on our profitability if we are unable to meet the requirements of such contracts 
the expansion of our business into managed services creates new and increased areas of risk that we have not been exposed to in the past and that we may not be able to properly assess or mitigate against 
in july  we announced the formation of our global services organization and we plan to expand our business by offering additional and expanded managed services for existing and new types of customers  such as designing  building and managing the network for emergency service organizations or enterprise customers 
the 
table of contents offering of managed services involves the integration of multiple services  multiple vendors and multiple technologies 
such expansion will bring us into contact with new regulatory requirements and restrictions with which we will have to comply 
this may increase the costs and delay or limit the range of new services which we will be able to offer 
the managed services business is one characterized by large subcontracting arrangements and we may not be able to obtain adequate indemnities or other protections from our subcontractors to adequately mitigate our risk to our customers 
we do not currently carry professional liability insurance  as such insurance is expensive to obtain for the amount of coverage typically requested by certain customers and we are therefore self insured for potential claims resulting from the managed services we provide 
a portion of our business is dependent upon us government contracts and grants  which are highly regulated and subject to oversight audits by us government representatives and subject to cancellations 
such audits could result in adverse findings and negatively impact our business 
our government business is subject to specific procurement regulations with numerous compliance requirements 
these requirements  although customary in us government contracting  increase our performance and compliance costs 
these costs may increase in the future  thereby reducing our margins  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition 
failure to comply with these regulations could lead to suspension or debarment from us government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time  and the inability to receive future grants 
among the causes for debarment are violations of various laws  including those related to procurement integrity  export control  us government security regulations  employment practices  protection of the environment  accuracy of records  proper recording of costs  foreign corruption and the false claims act 
generally  us government contracts and grants are subject to oversight audits by us government representatives 
such audits could result in adjustments to our contracts or grants 
any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract or grant may not be allowed  and such costs already reimbursed may have to be refunded 
future audits and adjustments  if required  may materially reduce our revenues or profits upon completion and final negotiation of audits 
negative audit findings could also result in investigations  termination of a contract or grant  forfeiture of profits or reimbursements  suspension of payments  fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the us government 
all contracts with the us government are subject to cancellation at the convenience of the us government 
in addition  contacts with government officials and participation in political activities are areas that are tightly controlled by federal  state and local laws 
failure to comply with these laws could cost us opportunities to seek certain government sales opportunities or even result in fines  prosecution  or debarment 
we derive a portion of our revenue from government customers who award business through competitive bidding which can involve significant upfront costs and risks 
this effort may not result in awards of business or we may fail to accurately estimate the costs to fulfill contracts awarded to us  which could have adverse consequences on our future profitability 
many government customers  including most us government customers  award business through a competitive bidding process  which results in greater competition and increased pricing pressure 
the competitive bidding process involves significant cost and managerial time to prepare bids for contracts that may not be awarded to us 
even if we are awarded contracts  we may fail to accurately estimate the resources and costs required to fulfill a contract  which could negatively impact the profitability of any contract award to us 
in addition  following a contract award  we have experienced and may continue to experience significant expense or delay  contract modification or contract rescission as a result of customer delay or our competitors protesting or challenging contracts awarded to us in competitive bidding 
government regulation of radio frequencies may limit the growth of public safety broadband systems or reduce barriers to entry for new competitors 
radio frequencies are required to provide wireless services 
the allocation of frequencies is regulated in the us and other countries and limited spectrum space is allocated to wireless services and specifically to public safety users 
the growth of public safety broadband communications systems may be affected i by regulations relating to 
table of contents the access to allocated spectrum for public safety users  ii if adequate frequencies are not allocated  or iii if new technologies are not developed to better utilize the frequencies currently allocated for such use 
industry growth may also be affected by new licensing fees required to use frequencies 
the us leads the world in spectrum deregulation  allowing new wireless communications technologies to be developed and offered for sale 
examples include wireless local area network systems  such as wifi  mesh technologies and wide area network systems  such as wimax and lte 
other countries have also deregulated portions of their available spectrum to allow deployment of these and other technologies 
deregulation may introduce new competition and new opportunities for us 
the us is currently contemplating allocating the mhz in the mhz spectrum d block to public safety 
alternatively the d block spectrum may be auctioned to commercial carriers  as has been advocated by the federal communications commission fcc 
failure to allocate the d block spectrum to public safety could reduce sales of next generation public safety communications systems in the us and  as a result  could negatively impact our business 
even if d block legislation passes  there remains a risk that some provisions of the legislation may limit our ability to compete for lte business and could also limit future narrowband sales if the legislation requires public safety to give back narrowband spectrum in the mhz spectrum block 
our customers and suppliers are located throughout the world and  as a result  we face risks that other companies that are not global may not face 
our customers and suppliers are located throughout the world and more than of our revenue is generated by customers outside the us in addition  we have a number of manufacturing  research and development  administrative and sales facilities outside the us and more than of our employees are employed outside the us most of our suppliers operations are outside the us and most of our products are manufactured outside the us as with all companies that have sizeable sales and operations outside the us  we are exposed to risks that could negatively impact sales or profitability  including but not limited to i import export regulations  tariffs  trade barriers and trade disputes  customs classifications and certifications  including but not limited to changes in classifications or errors or omissions related to such classifications and certifications  ii changes in us and us rules related to trade  environmental  health and safety  technical standards and consumer protection  iii longer payment cycles  iv tax issues  such as tax law changes  variations in tax laws from country to country and as compared to the us  obligations under tax incentive agreements  difficulties in repatriating cash generated or held abroad in a tax efficient manner and difficulties in securing local country approvals for cash repatriations  v currency fluctuations  particularly in the euro  chinese renminbi  the british pound  japanese yen  malaysian ringgit and the brazilian real among others  vi foreign exchange regulations  which may limit our ability to convert or repatriate foreign currency  vii challenges in collecting accounts receivable  viii cultural and language differences  ix employment regulations and local labor conditions  x difficulties protecting intellectual property in foreign countries  xi instability in economic or political conditions  including inflation  recession and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts  xii natural disasters such as the recent earthquake and tsunami in japan and floods in thailand  xiii public health issues or outbreaks  xiv changes in laws or regulations that negatively impact benefits being received by us or that require costly modifications in products sold or operations performed in such countries  xv the impact of each of the foregoing on our outsourcing and procurement arrangements  and xvi litigation in foreign court systems and foreign administrative proceedings 
many of our products that are manufactured outside the us are manufactured in asia primarily malaysia and china and latin america primarily mexico 
if manufacturing in these regions is disrupted  our overall capacity could be significantly reduced and sales or profitability could be negatively impacted 
furthermore  the legal system in china is still developing and this and other legal systems around the world are subject to change 
accordingly  our operations and orders for products in china could be negatively impacted by changes to  or interpretation of  chinese law 
we also have a presence in emerging markets such as india 
we face additional challenges in emerging markets  including creating demand for our products and the negative impact of changes in the laws or the interpretation of the laws  in those countries 
we also are subject to risks that our operations could be conducted by our employees  contractors  representatives or agents in ways that violate the foreign corrupt practices act  the uk anti bribery act  or other 
table of contents similar anti corruption laws 
while we have policies and procedures to comply with these laws  our employees  contractors  representatives and agents may take actions that violate our policies 
any such violations could have a negative impact on our business 
moreover  we face additional risks that our anti corruption policies and procedures may be violated by third party sales representatives or other third parties that help sell our products or provide other services  because such representatives or agents are not our employees and it may be more difficult to oversee their conduct 
we may not continue to have access to the capital markets for financing on acceptable terms and conditions  particularly if our credit ratings are downgraded 
from time to time we access the capital markets to obtain financing 
our access to the capital markets and the availably of acceptable terms and conditions are impacted by many factors  including i our credit ratings  ii the liquidity of the overall capital markets  and iii the current state of the economy 
there can be no assurances that we will continue to have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to us 
we are rated middle triple b by all three national rating agencies 
any downward changes by the rating agencies to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities 
under certain circumstances  if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken  an increase in the interest rate payable by us under our revolving credit facility could result 
in addition  a downgrade in our credit ratings could limit our ability to access the debt markets  provide performance bonds  bid bonds  standby letters of credit and surety bonds  hedge foreign exchange risk  fund our foreign affiliates  and sell receivables 
a downgrade in our credit rating could also result in less favorable trade terms with suppliers 
in addition  any downgrades in our credit ratings may affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and may affect the terms of any such financing 
any future disruptions  uncertainty or volatility in the capital markets may result in higher funding costs for us and adversely affect our ability to access funds and other credit related products 
changes in our effective tax rate may have a negative impact on future operating results 
we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign tax jurisdictions 
our effective tax rate may be negatively impacted by i changes in the mix of earnings taxable in jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates  ii changes in tax laws and accounting principles  iii changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  iv failure to meet commitments under tax incentive agreements  v discovery of new information during the course of tax return preparation  vi increases in nondeductible expenses  or vii difficulties in repatriating cash held abroad in a tax efficient manner 
tax audits may also negatively impact our effective tax rate 
we are subject to continued examination of our income tax returns  and tax authorities may disagree with our tax positions and assess additional tax 
we regularly evaluate the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuing examinations will not have a negative impact on future operating results 
if the quality of our products does not meet our customers expectations or regulatory or industry standards  then our sales and operating earnings  and ultimately our reputation  could be negatively impacted 
some of the products we sell may have quality issues resulting from the design or manufacture of the product  or from the software used in the product 
sometimes  these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers 
often these issues are identified prior to the shipment of the products and may cause delays in shipping products to customers  or even the cancellation of orders by customers 
sometimes  we discover quality issues in the products after they have been shipped to our customers  requiring us to resolve such issues in a timely manner that is the least disruptive to our customers 
such pre shipment and post shipment quality issues can have legal and financial ramifications  including delays in the recognition of revenue  loss of revenue or future orders  customer imposed penalties on us for failure to meet contractual requirements  increased costs associated with repairing or replacing products  and a negative impact on our goodwill and brand name reputation 
in some cases  if the quality issue affects the product s safety or regulatory compliance  then such a defective product may need to be stop shipped or recalled 
depending on the nature of the defect and the number of products in the field  it could cause us to incur substantial recall costs  in addition to the costs associated with the potential loss of future orders and the damage to our goodwill or brand reputation 
in addition  we may be required  under certain customer contracts  to pay damages for failed performance that might exceed the revenue 
table of contents that we receive from the contracts 
in certain jurisdictions when contracting with the government no limitation to liability is permitted by law 
recalls involving regulatory non compliance could also result in fines and additional costs 
finally  recalls could result in third party litigation by persons or companies alleging harm or economic damage as a result or the use of the products 
many of our components and products are designed or manufactured by third parties and if such third parties lack sufficient quality control or if there are significant changes in the financial or business condition of such third parties  it may have a negative impact on our business 
we rely on third parties to design or manufacture many of our components and finished products 
we could have difficulties fulfilling our orders and our sales and profits could decline if i we are not able to engage such manufacturers with the capabilities or capacities required by our business  ii such third parties lack sufficient quality control and fail to deliver quality components or products on time and at reasonable prices or deliver products that do not meet regulatory or industry standards or requirements  or iii if there are significant changes in the financial or business condition of such third parties 
we utilize the services of subcontractors to perform under many of our contracts and the inability of our subcontractors to perform could cause our products or services to be produced or delivered in an untimely or unsatisfactory manner 
we engage subcontractors on many of our contracts and as we expand our global services organization our use of subcontractors will increase 
we may have disputes with our subcontractors  including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor 
our subcontractors may not be able to acquire or maintain the quality of the materials  components  subsystems and services they supply  which might result in greater product returns  service problems and warranty claims and regulatory compliance issues and could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
failure of our suppliers  subcontractors  third party distributors and representatives to use acceptable ethical business practices could negatively impact our business 
it is our policy to require our suppliers and subcontractors to operate in compliance with applicable laws  rules and regulations regarding working conditions  employment practices  environmental compliance  anti corruption and trademark and copyright licensing 
however  we do not control their labor and other business practices 
if one of our suppliers or subcontractors violates labor or other laws or implements labor or other business practices that are regarded as unethical  the shipment of finished products to us could be interrupted  orders could be canceled  relationships could be terminated and our reputation could be damaged 
if one of our suppliers or subcontractors fails to procure necessary license rights to trademarks  copyrights or patents  legal action could be taken against us that could impact the salability of our products and expose us to financial obligations to a third party 
any of these events could have a negative impact on our sales and results of operations 
our success is dependent  in part  upon our ability to form successful strategic alliances 
if these arrangements do not develop as expected  our business may be negatively impacted 
we currently partner with industry leaders and other large organizations to meet customer product and service requirements and to develop innovative advances in design and technology 
some of our partnerships allow us to supplement internal manufacturing capacity and share the cost of developing next generation technologies 
other partnerships allow us to offer more services and features to our customers 
however  such arrangements carry an element of risk because  in many cases  we must compete in some business areas with a company with which we have a partnership and  at the same time  cooperate with that company in other business areas 
if such arrangements do not develop as expected  our business could be negatively impacted 
as we expand our global services organization our need to partner will increase 
we rely on third party distributors  representatives and retailers to sell certain of our products in addition to our own sales force  we offer our products through a variety of third party distributors  representatives and retailers 
our distributors or representatives may also market other products that compete with our products 
the loss  termination or failure of one or more of our distributors or representatives to effectively 
table of contents promote our products  or changes in the financial or business condition of these distributors  representatives or retailers  could affect our ability to bring products to market 
our future operating results depend on our ability to purchase a sufficient amount of materials  parts and components to meet the demands of our customers and any reduction or interruption in supplies or significant increase in the price of supplies could have a negative impact on our results of operations 
our ability to meet customers demands depends  in part  on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of quality materials  parts and components from our suppliers 
if demand for our products increases from our current expectations or if suppliers are unable to meet our demand for other reasons  including as a result of natural disasters or financial issues  we could experience shortages 
we have experienced shortages in the past  including recently as a result of the earthquake and tsunami in japan and flooding in thailand  that have negatively impacted our results of operations 
although we work closely with our suppliers to avoid shortages  there can be no assurance that we will not encounter shortages in the future or that such shortages will not negatively impact our results of operations 
furthermore  certain of our components are available only from a single source or limited sources 
we may not be able to diversify sources in a timely manner 
a reduction or interruption in supplies or a significant increase in the price of supplies could have a negative impact on our business 
in addition  our current contractual arrangements with certain suppliers may be cancelled or not extended by such suppliers and  therefore  not afford us with sufficient protection against a reduction or interruption in supplies 
moreover  in the event any of these single source or limited source suppliers breach their contracts with us  our legal remedies associated with such a breach may be insufficient to compensate us for any damages we may suffer 
we rely on complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business 
any significant system or network disruption  including as a result of third party attacks  could have a negative impact on our operations  sales and operating results 
we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks  some of which are within the company and some are outsourced 
all information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources  including but not limited to computer viruses  security breach  energy blackouts  natural disasters  terrorism  war and telecommunication failures 
as a provider of high technology emergency response systems  we face additional risk as a target of sophisticated attacks aimed at compromising our intellectual property  referred to as advanced persistent threats 
in addition  we plan to implement a number of significant business systems upgrades in which  if defective or improperly installed or implemented may result in a business disruption 
a system failure or security breach could negatively impact our operations and financial results 
in addition  we may incur additional costs to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions or security breaches 
there has been a sharp increase in laws in europe  the us and elsewhere imposing requirements for the handling of personal data 
there is a risk that failures in systems designed to protect private  personal or proprietary data held by us will allow such data to be disclosed to or seen by others  resulting in application of regulatory penalties  remediation obligations and or private litigation by parties whose data were disclosed 
we face many risks relating to intellectual property rights 
our business will be harmed if i we  our customers and or our suppliers are found to have infringed intellectual property rights of third parties  ii the intellectual property indemnities in our supplier agreements are inadequate to cover damages and losses due to infringement of third party intellectual property rights by supplier products  iii we are required to provide broad intellectual property indemnities to our customers  iv our intellectual property protection is inadequate to protect against threats of misappropriation from internal or external sources or otherwise inadequate to protect our proprietary rights  or v our competitors negotiate significantly more favorable terms for licensed intellectual property 
we may be harmed if we are forced to make publicly available  under the relevant open source licenses  certain internally developed software related intellectual property as a result of either our use of open source software code or the use of third party software that contains open source code 

table of contents since our products are comprised of complex technology  much of which we acquire from suppliers through the purchase of components or licensing of software  we are often involved in or impacted by assertions  including both requests for licenses and litigation  regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
third parties have asserted  and in the future may assert  intellectual property infringement claims against us and against our customers and suppliers 
these assertions against us  and our customers and suppliers have been increasing as the complexity of our products has increased 
many of these assertions are brought by non practicing entities whose principle business model is to secure patent licensing based revenue from product manufacturing companies 
the patent holders often make broad and sweeping claims regarding the applicability of their patents to our products  seeking a percentage of sales as licenses fees  seeking injunctions to pressure us into taking a license  or a combination thereof 
defending claims may be expensive and divert the time and efforts of our management and employees 
increasingly  third parties have sought broad injunctive relief which could limit our ability to sell our products in the us or elsewhere with intellectual property subject to the claims 
if we do not succeed in any such litigation  we could be required to expend significant resources to pay damages  develop non infringing products or to obtain licenses to the intellectual property that is the subject of such litigation  each of which could have a negative impact on our financial results 
however  we cannot be certain that any such licenses  if available at all  will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms 
in some cases  we might be forced to stop delivering certain products if we or our customer or supplier are subject to a final injunction 
we attempt to negotiate favorable intellectual property indemnities with our suppliers for infringement of third party intellectual property rights 
however  there is no assurance that we will be successful in our negotiations or that a supplier s indemnity will cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers due to the infringing products or that a supplier will choose to accept a license or modify or replace its products with non infringing products which would otherwise mitigate such damages and losses 
further  we may not be able to participate in intellectual property litigation involving a supplier and may not be able to influence any ultimate resolution or outcome that may negatively impact our sales if a court enters an injunction that enjoins the supplier s products or if the international trade commission issues an exclusionary order that blocks our products from importation into the us the frequency with which intellectual property disputes involving our suppliers have resulted in our involvement in international trade commission proceedings has increased 
these proceedings are costly and entail the risk that we will be subjected to a ban on the importation of our products into the us solely as a result of our use of a supplier s components 
in addition  our customers increasingly demand that we indemnify them broadly from all damages and losses resulting from intellectual property litigation against them 
our patent and other intellectual property rights are important competitive tools and may generate income under license agreements 
we regard our intellectual property as proprietary and attempt to protect it with patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secret laws  confidentiality agreements and other methods 
we also generally restrict access to and distribution of our proprietary information 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to obtain and use our proprietary information or develop similar technology independently 
in addition  effective patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights by third parties and the cost of any litigation necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights could have a negative impact on our financial results 
as we expand our business  including through acquisitions  and compete with new competitors in new markets  the breadth and strength of our intellectual property portfolio in those new areas may not be as developed as in our longer standing businesses 
this may expose us to a heightened risk of litigation and other challenges from competitors in these new markets 
further  competitors may be able to negotiate significantly more favorable terms for licensed intellectual property than we are able to  which puts them at a competitive advantage 
as our products become more like commercial products  through the adoption of industry standard technologies  for instance  our intellectual property related risks may increase 

table of contents we no longer own certain logos and other trademarks  trade names and service marks  including motorola  moto  motorola solutions and the stylized m logo and all derivatives and formatives thereof motorola marks and we license the motorola marks from motorola mobility 
our joint use of the motorola marks could result in product and market confusion and negatively impact our ability to expand our business under the motorola brand 
in addition  if we do not comply with the terms of the license agreement we could lose our rights to the motorola marks 
we have a worldwide  perpetual and royalty free license from motorola mobility to use the motorola marks as part of our corporate name and in connection with the manufacture  sale  and marketing of our current products and services 
the license of the motorola marks is important to us because of the reputation of the motorola brand for our products and services 
although we will continue to be able to use the motorola marks in certain fields of use we no longer own the motorola marks after the distribution of motorola mobility 
there are risks associated with both motorola mobility and the company using the motorola marks and with this loss of ownership 
as both motorola mobility and the company will be using the motorola marks  confusion could arise in the market  including customer and investor confusion regarding the products offered by and the actions of the two companies 
this risk could increase as both motorola mobility s and our products continue to converge 
also  any negative publicity associated with either company in the future could adversely affect the public image of the other 
in addition because our license of the motorola marks will be limited to products and services within our specified fields of use  we will not be permitted to use the motorola marks in other fields of use without the approval of motorola mobility 
in the event that we desire to expand our business into any other fields of use  we may need to do so with a brand other than motorola 
developing a brand as well known and with as much brand equity as motorola could take considerable time and expense 
the risk of needing to develop a second brand increases as motorola mobility s and our products continue to converge and as our business expands into other fields of use 
in addition  we could lose our rights to use the motorola marks if we do not comply with the terms of the license agreement 
such a loss could negatively affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
furthermore  motorola mobility has the right to license the brand to third parties and either motorola mobility or licensed third parties may use the brand in ways that make the brand less attractive for customers of motorola solutions  creating increased risk that motorola solutions may need to develop an alternate or additional brand 
we may continue to make strategic acquisitions of other companies or businesses and these acquisitions introduce significant risks and uncertainties  including risks related to integrating the acquired businesses and achieving benefits from the acquisitions 
in order to position ourselves to take advantage of growth opportunities  we have made  and expect to continue to make  strategic acquisitions that involve significant risks and uncertainties 
these risks and uncertainties include i the difficulty in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and effective manner  ii the challenges in achieving strategic objectives  cost savings and other benefits from acquisitions  iii the risk that our markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the technologies acquired do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets  iv the potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses  v the risk of diverting the attention of senior management from our operations  vi the risks of entering new markets in which we have limited experience  vii risks associated with integrating financial reporting and internal control systems  viii difficulties in expanding information technology systems and other business processes to accommodate the acquired businesses  and ix future impairments of goodwill of an acquired business 
acquisition candidates in the industries in which we participate may carry higher relative valuations based on their earnings than we do 
this is particularly evident in software and services businesses 
acquiring a business that has a higher valuation than motorola solutions may be dilutive to our earnings  especially if the acquired business has little or no revenue 
in addition  we may not pursue opportunities that are highly dilutive to near term earnings 
key employees of acquired businesses may receive substantial value in connection with a transaction in the form of change in control agreements  acceleration of stock options and the lifting of restrictions on other equity based compensation rights 
to retain such employees and integrate the acquired business  we may offer additional retention incentives  but it may still be difficult to retain certain key employees 

table of contents we have completed a number of large divestitures over the last several years and have ongoing potential liability associated with those transactions and the businesses we divested 
over the last several years we have spun off or sold a number of businesses  including motorola mobility and our networks business and we may divest other businesses in the future 
in most of our divestitures we make representations and warranties and agree to covenants relating to the business divested 
we remain liable for a period of time for breaches of representations  warranties and covenants and we also indemnify buyers in the event of such breaches and for other specific risks 
in addition  it is not unusual to remain liable for certain pre closing liabilities associated with the divested business  such as pension liabilities  taxes  environmental liabilities and litigation 
in certain situations  such as our spin off transactions  we may retain ongoing risk in the event of a liquidation or bankruptcy of the company we spun off  even if they assumed certain liabilities because they were incurred when they were part of the company 
in addition  although we often assign contracts associated with the divested business to a buyer in a divestiture  often that assignment will be subject to the consent of the contractual counterparty  which may not be obtained or may be conditioned  resulting in the company remaining liable under the contract 
even though we establish reserves for any expected ongoing liability associated with divested businesses  those reserves may not be sufficient if unexpected liabilities arise and this could negatively impact our financial condition and future results of operations 
following the sale of our networks infrastructure assets we retained certain promissory notes and other obligations relating to vendor financing  but we no longer have a customer vendor relationship with the borrowers  which may put us at increased risk for defaults 
certain of the customers of our former networks business who purchased large infrastructure systems requested that their suppliers provide financing in connection with equipment purchases 
we retained the promissory notes and other obligations related to such vendor financing that was consummated up to the closing of the sale of our networks business on april  as of december   the outstanding amount was approximately million 
as we no longer have a customer vendor relationship with the borrowers following the sale we could be at increased risk of a default by such customers  as they may choose to pay their current vendors before they pay us 
in addition  a majority of this debt is issued by former customers operating in the middle east and could be negatively impacted by political unrest in this region 
finally  we retained certain recourse obligations with respect to a portion of the promissory notes and other obligations which we sold in in the event those notes and obligations are uncollectable as a result of the structure of our transaction with nsn 
we may be required to record additional goodwill or other long lived asset impairment charges  which could result in an additional significant charge to earnings 
under generally accepted accounting principles  we review our long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually 
factors that may be considered in assessing whether goodwill or intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in our stock price or market capitalization  reduced estimates of future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry 
no goodwill or long lived assets impairment charges were recorded during  or declines in our stock price or reductions in our future cash flow estimates and future operating results may require us to record significant additional goodwill or other long lived asset impairment charges in our financial statements in future periods  which could negatively impact our financial results 
changes in our operations or sales outside the us markets could result in lost benefits in impacted countries and increase our cost of doing business 
we have entered into various agreements with non us governments  agencies or similar organizations under which we receive certain benefits relating to its operations and or sales in the jurisdiction 
if our circumstances change  and operations or sales are not at levels originally anticipated  we may be at risk of having to reimburse benefits already granted  and losing some or all of these benefits and increasing our cost of doing business 
our success depends in part upon our ability to attract  retain and prepare succession plans for senior management and key employees 
the performance of our ceo  senior management and other key employees is critical to our success 
if we are unable to retain talented  highly qualified senior management and other key employees or attract them when 
table of contents needed  it could negatively impact us 
we rely on the experience of our senior management  who have specific knowledge relating to us and our industry that is difficult to replace and competition for management with experience in the communications industry is intense 
a loss of the ceo  a member of senior management or key employee particularly to a competitor could also place us at a competitive disadvantage 
further  if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of our ceo  senior management and other key employees  the company could be negatively impacted 
it may be difficult for us to recruit and retain the types of engineers and other highly skilled employees that are necessary to remain competitive 
competition for key technical personnel in high technology industries is intense 
we believe that our future success depends in large part on our continued ability to hire  assimilate  retain and leverage the skills of qualified engineers and other highly skilled personnel needed to develop successful new products 
we may not be as successful as our competitors at recruiting  assimilating  retaining and utilizing these highly skilled personnel 
in  we are planning changes to our annual stock grants  which may increase the retention risk of affected employees 
the unfavorable outcome of any pending or future litigation or administrative action could negatively impact the company 
our financial results and reputation could be negatively impacted by unfavorable outcomes to any pending or future litigation or administrative actions  including those related to the foreign corrupt practices act and other anti corruption laws 
see item legal proceedings 
there can be no assurances as to the favorable outcome of any litigation or administrative proceedings 
in addition  it can be very costly to defend litigation or administrative proceedings and these costs could negatively impact our financial results 
it is important that we are able to obtain many different types of insurance  and if we are not able to obtain insurance or we exhaust our coverage we are forced to retain the risk 
we have many types of insurance coverage and are also self insured for some risks and obligations 
while the cost and availability of most insurance is stable  there are still certain types and levels of insurance that remain difficult to obtain 
as we grow our global services organization we are increasingly being asked to obtain professional liability insurance 
we do not currently carry professional liability insurance as such insurance is expensive to obtain for the amount of coverage often requested by certain customers 
natural disasters and certain risks arising from securities claims  professional liability and public liability are potential self insured events that could negatively impact our financial results 
in addition  while we maintain insurance for certain risks  the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all claims or liabilities  and we may be forced to bear substantial costs from an accident  incident or claim 
we are subject to a wide range of product regulatory and safety  consumer  worker safety and environmental laws 
our operations and the products we manufacture and or sell are subject to a wide range of global laws 
compliance with existing or future laws could subject us to future costs or liabilities  impact our production capabilities  constrict our ability to sell  expand or acquire facilities  restrict what products and services we can offer  and generally impact our financial performance 
some of these laws are environmental and relate to the use  disposal  clean up of  and exposure to certain substances 
for example  in the united states  laws often require parties to fund remedial studies or actions regardless of fault and often times in response to action or omissions that were legal at the time they occurred 
we continue to incur disposal costs and have ongoing remediation obligations 
changes to environmental laws or our discovery of additional obligations under these laws could have a negative impact on our financial performance 
laws focused on the energy efficiency of electronic products and accessories  recycling of both electronic products and packaging  reducing or eliminating certain hazardous substances in electronic products  and the transportation of batteries continue to expand significantly 
laws pertaining to accessibility features of electronic products  standardization of connectors and power supplies  the transportation of lithium ion batteries and other aspects are also proliferating 
there are also demanding and rapidly changing laws around the globe related to issues such as product safety  radio interference  radio frequency radiation exposure  and consumer and social mandates pertaining to use of 
table of contents wireless or electronic equipment 
these laws  and changes to these laws  could have a substantial impact on whether we can offer certain products  solutions and services  on product costs  and on what capabilities and characteristics our products or services can or must include 
these laws impact our products and negatively affect our ability to manufacture and sell products competitively 
we expect these trends to continue 
in addition  we anticipate that we will see increased demand to meet voluntary criteria related to reduction or elimination of certain constituents from products  increasing energy efficiency  and providing additional accessibility 
we may be unable to obtain a sufficient supply of components and parts that are verified free of conflict minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries  which could result in a shortage of such components and parts or reputational damages if we are unable to certify that our products are free of such minerals 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act included disclosure requirements regarding the use of conflict minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries drc and procedures regarding a manufacturer s efforts to prevent the sourcing of such conflict minerals 
while final rules implementing these requirements have not yet been released  the implementation may limit the pool of suppliers who can provide us verifiable drc conflict free components and parts  and we are not certain that we will be able to obtain products in sufficient quantities that meet the drc conflict free designation as proposed by the requirements 
also  since our supply chain is complex  we may face reputational challenges with our customers  other stockholders and the activist community if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for the defined conflict metals used in our products 
changes in government policies and laws  funding or economic conditions may negatively impact our financial results 
our results may be affected by changes in trade  monetary and fiscal policies  laws and regulations  or other activities of us and non us governments  agencies and similar organizations 
in particular  the financial results of our government segment may be negatively impacted by any decreases in the level of government funding  including availability of grants  for public safety projects 
our results may also be affected by social and economic conditions  which impact our operations  including in emerging markets in asia  india  latin america and eastern europe  and in markets subject to ongoing political hostilities and war  including the middle east 
a large percentage of our cash and cash equivalents are held outside of the united states and we could be subject to repatriation delays and costs which could reduce our financial flexibility 
a large percentage of our cash and cash equivalents is held outside the us  while many of our liabilities  such as our public debt and the majority of our pension liabilities  are payable in the us while we regularly repatriate funds with minimal adverse financial impact  repatriation of some of the funds has been and could continue to be subject to delay for local country approvals and could have potential adverse tax consequences 
as a result of having a lower amount of the cash and cash equivalents in the us  our financial flexibility may be reduced 
our share price has been and may continue to be volatile 
our share price has been volatile due  in part  to generally volatile securities markets and the volatility in the telecommunications and technology companies securities markets in particular 
factors other than our financial results that may affect our share price include  but are not limited to  market expectations of our performance  spending plans of our customers and the level of perceived growth in the industries in which we participate 
in connection with the distribution of motorola mobility  motorola mobility indemnified us for certain liabilities and we indemnified motorola mobility for certain liabilities 
this indemnity may not be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of the liabilities assumed by motorola mobility and motorola mobility may be unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations to us in the future 
pursuant to the master separation and distribution agreement and certain other agreements with motorola mobility  motorola mobility agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities  and we agreed to indemnify motorola mobility for certain liabilities  in each case for uncapped amounts 
motorola mobility has entered into an agreement to be acquired by google  which the transaction is currently awaiting regulatory approval 
this indemnity obligation will not change as a result of the acquisition of motorola mobility by google 
there can be no 
table of contents assurance that the indemnity from motorola mobility will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities  or that motorola mobility will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations  even if the pending acquisition by google is completed 
third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that motorola mobility has agreed to assume 
even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from motorola mobility any amounts for which we are held liable  we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves 
in addition  indemnities that we may be required to provide motorola mobility are not subject to any cap  may be significant and could negatively impact our business 
each of these risks could negatively affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
for more detailed information  see the amended and restated master separation and distribution agreement which was filed as an exhibit to our form q for the third quarter a change of control of or bankruptcy of motorola mobility could result in an incompatible third party owning the motorola marks or the loss of certain rights  including the license 
since motorola mobility owns the motorola marks  in the event motorola mobility is acquired  the acquiring entity would gain control of the motorola marks 
if the acquisition by google is completed  the motorola marks will be controlled by google 
in the event of a liquidation of motorola mobility or the then owner of the motorola marks  it is possible that a bankruptcy court would permit the motorola marks to be assigned to a third party 
while our right to use the motorola marks under our license should continue in our specified field of use in such situations  it is possible that we could be party to a license arrangement with a third party whose interests are incompatible with ours  thereby potentially making the license arrangement difficult to administer  and increasing the costs and risks associated with sharing the motorola marks 
in addition  there is a risk that  in the event of a bankruptcy of motorola mobility or the then owner of the motorola marks  motorola mobility  the then owner or its bankruptcy trustee may attempt to reject the license  or a bankruptcy court may refuse to uphold the license or certain of its terms 
such a loss could negatively affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we contributed a significant portfolio of intellectual property rights  including patents  to motorola mobility and we are unable to leverage these intellectual property rights as we did prior to the distribution of motorola mobility 
we contributed approximately  granted patents and approximately  pending patent applications worldwide to motorola mobility in connection with the distribution 
although we have a perpetual  royalty free license to these patents and other intellectual property rights  we no longer own them 
as a result we are unable to leverage these intellectual property rights for purposes of generating licensing revenue or entering into favorable licensing arrangements with third parties 
as a result we may incur increased license fees or litigation costs 
although we cannot predict the extent of such unanticipated costs  it is possible such costs could negatively impact our financial results 
completion of the distribution of motorola mobility may not enhance long term shareholder value 
we completed the distribution of motorola mobility on january  at the time of this distribution  our board and management team  after consultation with independent financial and legal advisors  believed that the distribution of motorola mobility as planned would enhance long term shareholder value 
there can be no assurance  however  that the combined value of our common stock and the common stock of motorola mobility will equal or exceed what the value of our common stock would have been in the absence of the distribution in the long term  particularly if the acquisition of motorola mobility by google is not completed 
the combined value of the common stock of the two companies could be lower than anticipated for a variety of reasons  including  among others  the inability of motorola mobility to complete its acquisition by google or to compete effectively as an independent company

table of contents as of december   we owned facilities manufacturing  sales  service and office  of which were located in the americas region usa  canada  mexico  central and south america and of which were located in other countries 
as of december   the company leased facilities  of which were located in the americas region and of which were located in other countries 
as of december   we primarily utilized major facilities for the manufacturing and distribution of our products  and these facilities were located in penang  malaysia  reynosa  mexico  mcallen  texas  schaumburg  illinois  berlin  germany  and suzhou  china 
motorola solutions generally considers the productive capacity of the plants operated by each of our business segments to be adequate and sufficient for the requirements of each business group 
the extent of utilization of such manufacturing facilities varies from plant to plant and from time to time during the year 
in  a substantial portion of our products were manufactured in our own facilities in mexico and malaysia 
a portion of our manufacturing is done by a small number of non affiliated electronics manufacturing suppliers and distribution and logistics services providers  most of which are outside the united states 
we rely on these third party providers in order to enhance our ability to lower costs and deliver products that meet consumer demands 
if manufacturing in our own facilities  or by third parties who manufacture and assemble approximately of our products were disrupted  our overall productive capacity could be significantly reduced

on november   the court denied plaintiffs motion for class certification and the plaintiffs have not appealed that ruling
