we may incur losses and costs as a result of product liability claims that may be brought against us or any product recalls we have to make 
the sale of food products for human consumption involves the risk of injury to consumers 
such hazards could result from tampering by unauthorized third parties  product contamination such as listeria  e coli  and salmonella or spoilage  the presence of foreign objects  substances  chemicals  and other agents  residues introduced during the growing  storage  handling or transportation phases  or improperly formulated products 
as a manufacturer and marketer of food products  we may be subjected to various product liability claims 
the product liability and product recall insurance maintained by us may not be adequate to cover any loss or exposure for product liability  and such insurance may not continue to be available on terms acceptable to us 
any product liability claim not fully covered by insurance  as well as any adverse publicity from a product liability claim or product recall  could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
newly adopted governmental regulations could increase our costs or liabilities or impact the sale of our products 
the food industry is highly regulated and subject to change 
new or increased government regulation of the food industry  including areas related to production processes  product quality  packaging  labeling  marketing  storage and distribution  and labor unions  could adversely impact our operating results by increasing production costs or restricting methods of operation and distribution 
these regulations may address food industry or society factors  such as obesity  nutritional concerns and diet trends 
sales of our products could be materially and adversely affected if new laws or regulations are passed that require us to alter the taste or composition of our products or impose other obligations on us 

table of contents concerns with the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients could cause customers to avoid our products 
we could be adversely affected if customers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain products or ingredients 
negative publicity about these concerns  whether or not valid  may discourage customers from buying our products or cause disruptions in production or distribution of our products 
a significant portion of our revenues are derived from one product and one customer 
in  of our net revenues were attributable to our frozen products segment  the majority of which is attributable to rader farms kirkland co branded frozen berry product sales to costco 
overall  costco accounted for of our net revenues 
the remainder of our net revenues are derived from sales to a limited number of additional customers  either grocery chains or regional distributors  none of which individually accounted for more than of our net revenues for a decision by any major customer to cease or substantially reduce its purchases  or a decrease in the popularity of frozen berries during any year  could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we depend on a license agreement for the right to sell our tgi friday s brand 
for the year ended december   of our net revenues were attributable to the tgi friday s brand products  which are manufactured and sold by us pursuant to a license agreement with tgi friday s inc that expires in may  pursuant to the license agreement  we are subject to various requirements and conditions including  without limitation  minimum sales targets 
our failure to comply with certain of such requirements and conditions could result in the early termination of the license agreement by tgi friday s inc any termination of the tgi friday s license agreement  whether at the expiration of its term or prior thereto  could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
our business may be adversely affected by oversupply of snack and frozen products at the wholesale and retail levels and seasonal fluctuations 
profitability in the food product industry is subject to oversupply of certain snack and frozen products at the wholesale and retail levels  which can result in our products going out of date before they are sold 
the snack and frozen products industry is also seasonal 
consumers tend to purchase our snack products at higher levels during the major summer holidays and also at times surrounding the major sporting events throughout the year 
consumers tend to purchase fresh berries while in season and therefore we see a decline in frozen berry revenue in the summer months 
any of these seasonal effects may result in an oversupply or undersupply of our products 
additionally  we may face seasonal price increases for raw materials 
such seasonal costs could materially and adversely affect our operating results in any given quarter 
we may incur substantial costs in order to market our products 
successful marketing of our products generally depends upon obtaining adequate retail shelf space for product display  particularly in supermarkets 
frequently  food manufacturers and distributors such as us  incur additional costs in order to obtain additional shelf space 
whether or not we incur such costs in a particular market is dependent upon a number of factors  including demand for our products  relative availability of shelf space and general competitive conditions 
we may incur significant shelf space or other promotional costs as a necessary condition of entering into competition or maintaining market share in particular markets or stores 
if incurred  such costs may have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we may not be able to respond successfully to shifting consumer tastes 
consumer preferences are continually changing and are extremely difficult to predict 
our success depends in part on timely responding to current market trends and anticipating changing consumer tastes and dietary habits by developing and licensing new products and entering new markets 
the failure to adequately address changing consumer preferences could result in reduced demand for our products and have a material adverse affect our operating results 
the loss of certain key employees could adversely affect our business 
our success is dependent in large part upon the abilities of our executive officers  including terry mcdaniel  chief executive officer  and steve weinberger  chief financial officer 
our business strategy will challenge our executive officers  and the inability of such officers to perform their duties or our inability to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect upon our operating results 

table of contents we may not be able to successfully implement our strategy to expand our business internationally 
we plan to expand sales to canadian customers and are exploring other international market opportunities for our brands 
such expansion may require significant management attention and financial resources and may not produce desired levels of revenue 
international business is subject to inherent risks  including longer accounts receivable collection cycles  difficulties in managing operations across disparate geographical areas  difficulties enforcing agreements and intellectual property rights  fluctuations in local economic  market and political conditions  compliance requirements with us and foreign export regulations  potential adverse tax consequences and currency exchange rate fluctuations 
risks related to the snack product segment we may not be able to compete successfully in our highly competitive industry 
the market for snack foods  such as those sold by us  is large and intensely competitive 
competitive factors in the snack food industry include product quality and taste  brand awareness among consumers  access to supermarket shelf space  price  advertising and promotion  variety of snacks offered  nutritional content  product packaging and package design 
we compete in that market principally on the basis of product taste and quality 
the snack food industry is dominated by large food companies  including frito lay  inc  a subsidiary of pepsico  inc  procter and gamble  diamond foods  general mills and others which have substantially greater financial and other resources than us and sell brands that are more widely recognized than our products 
numerous other companies that are actual or potential competitors of ours  many with greater financial and other resources including more employees and more extensive facilities than us  offer products similar to ours 
in addition  many of such competitors offer a wider range of products than that offered by us 
local or regional markets often have significant smaller competitors  many of whom offer products similar to ours 
with expansion of our operations into new markets  we have and will continue to encounter significant competition from national  regional and local competitors that may be greater than that encountered by us in our existing markets 
in addition  such competitors may challenge our position in our existing markets 
unavailability of our necessary supplies  at reasonable prices  could adversely affect our operations 
our manufacturing costs are subject to fluctuations in the prices of potatoes  potato flakes  potato starch  corn and oil as well as other ingredients of our products 
potatoes  potato flakes  potato starch and corn are widely available year round  and we use a variety of oils in the production of our products 
nonetheless  we are dependent on our suppliers to provide us with products and ingredients in adequate supply and on a timely basis 
the failure of certain suppliers to meet our performance specifications  quality standards or delivery schedules could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
to the extent that product ingredients become scarce  substantially increase in price  or become unavailable or unavailable on commercially attractive terms  our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
from time to time  we may lock in prices for raw materials  such as oils  as we deem appropriate  and such strategies may result in us paying prices for raw materials that are above market at the time of purchase 
we do not own the patents for the technology we use to manufacture certain tgi friday s  boulder canyon  burger king tm and tato skins brand products  as well as certain private label branded products 
we license technology from a third party in connection with the manufacture of certain tgi friday s  boulder canyon  burger king tm and tato skins brand products  as well as certain private label branded products and have a royalty bearing  exclusive right license to use the technology necessary to produce these products in the united states  canada  and mexico until such time the parties mutually agree to terminate the agreement 
even though the patents for this technology expired december   in consideration for the use of this technology  we are required to make royalty payments to the third party on sales of products manufactured utilizing the technology until such termination date 
since these patents expired  we no longer have exclusive rights to this technology and  as a result  may face additional competition that could adversely affect our revenues 
moreover  our competitors  certain of which may have significantly greater resources than us  may utilize different technology in the manufacture of products that are similar to those currently manufactured  or that may in the future be manufactured  by us 
the entry of any such products into the marketplace could have a material adverse effect on our sales of certain tgi friday s  boulder canyon  burger kingtm and tato skins brand products  certain private label branded products  as well as any such future products 
risks related to the frozen products segment farming is subject to numerous inherent risks including changes in weather conditions or natural disasters that can have an adverse impact on crop production and materially affect our results of operations 
we are subject to the risks that generally relate to the agricultural industry 
adverse changes in weather conditions and 
table of contents natural disasters  such as earthquakes  droughts  extreme cold or pestilence  may affect the planting  growing and delivery of crops  reduce sales stock  interrupt distribution  and have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our competitors may be affected differently by such weather conditions and natural disasters depending on the location of their supplies or operations 
unavailability of purchased berries  at reasonable prices  could adversely affect operations 
our manufacturing costs are subject to fluctuations in the prices of certain commodity prices 
berries are not readily available year round  therefore  we use an individual quick frozen iqf technique to freeze the berries harvested for use during the year to meet processing demands 
in addition to freezing our own home grown berries  we also purchase a significant amount of berries from outside suppliers to meet customer demands 
we are dependent on our suppliers to provide us with adequate supply and on a timely basis 
the failure of certain suppliers to meet our performance specifications  quality standards or delivery schedules could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
to the extent that certain types of berries become scarce  substantially increase in price  or become unavailable or unavailable on commercially attractive terms  our operating results could be materially and adversely affected

a significant amount of our common stock is controlled by a small number of shareholders  and the interests of such shareholders may conflict with those of other shareholders 
as of december   larry polhill  a member of our board of directors  beneficially owned of our outstanding shares 
as a result  mr 
polhill may be able to exercise significant influence over the company and certain matters requiring approval of its stockholders  including the approval of significant corporate transactions  such as a merger or other sale of the company or its assets 
this could limit the ability of other stockholders of the company to influence corporate matters and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control of the company 
apart from transfer restrictions arising under applicable provisions of the securities laws  there are no restrictions on the ability of mr 
polhill to transfer any or all of his beneficial ownership at any time 
one or more of such transfers could have the effect of transferring effective control of the company  including to one or more parties not currently known to us 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue preferred stock  and the rights of holders of common stock may be adversely affected by the rights of holders of any such preferred stock 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to  shares of blank check preferred stock with such designations  rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our board of directors 
we may issue such shares of preferred stock in the future without shareholder approval 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock  while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  could have the effect of discouraging  delaying or preventing a change of control of the company  and preventing holders of common stock from realizing a premium on their shares 
in addition  under section of the delaware general corporation law the dgcl  we are prohibited from engaging in any business combination as defined in the dgcl with any interested shareholder as defined in the dgcl unless certain conditions are met

item legal proceedings we are periodically a party to various lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business 
management believes  based on discussions with legal counsel  that the resolution of such lawsuits  individually and in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in march  we learned that the jamba juice company was named as a defendant in a putative class action filed in the federal court for the north district of california and captioned kevin anderson v 
jamba juice company which claims that the use of the words all natural to describe the smoothie kits is misleading and deceptive to consumers and violates various california consumer protection statutes and unfair competition statutes
