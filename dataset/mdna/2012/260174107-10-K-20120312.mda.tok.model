item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion is based upon and should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this document 
we classify our revenues as admissions  event related  broadcasting and other 
admissions includes ticket sales for all our events 
event related revenue includes amounts received from sponsorship fees  luxury suite rentals  hospitality tent rentals and catering  concessions and souvenir sales and vendor commissions for the right to sell concessions and souvenirs at our facilities  sales of programs  track rentals and other event related revenues 
broadcasting revenue includes rights fees obtained for television and radio broadcasts of events held at our speedways and ancillary media rights fees 
revenues pertaining to specific events are deferred until the event is held 
concession revenue from concession stand sales and sales of souvenirs are recorded at the time of sale 
revenues and related expenses from barter transactions in which we receive advertising or other goods or services in exchange for sponsorships of motorsports events are recorded at fair value 
barter transactions accounted for   and  of total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
expenses that are not directly related to a specific event are recorded as incurred 
expenses that specifically relate to an event are deferred until the event is held  at which time they are expensed 
these expenses include prize and point fund monies and sanction fees paid to various sanctioning bodies  including nascar  marketing  cost of goods sold for merchandise and souvenirs  and other expenses associated with the promotion of our racing events 
results of operations year ended december  vs 
year ended december  admissions revenue was  in as compared to  in we promoted ten events during and the  decrease was primarily related to lower admissions revenue at our nascar event weekends at dover international speedway 
we believe the decrease in attendance at our dover weekends was attributable primarily to the general downturn in economic conditions  including those affecting disposable consumer income and corporate budgets such as employment and business conditions 
we believe that adverse economic trends  particularly credit availability  the decline in consumer confidence  continued high unemployment and high gas prices have contributed to the decrease in attendance 
event related revenue was  in as compared to  in the  decrease was primarily related to lower luxury suite rentals  hospitality tent rentals  catering revenues  expo space revenues and concessions and souvenir sales at our nascar event weekends at dover international speedway as a result of the lower attendance and the aforementioned economic conditions 
broadcasting revenue increased to  in from  in due to a contracted increase for the individual major motorsports events we promoted during operating and marketing expenses were  in as compared to  in the decrease was primarily due to cost cutting measures and reduced operating expenses resulting from the lower attendance at our nascar event weekends at dover international speedway 
we concluded in the third quarter of that it was necessary for us to review the carrying value of the long lived assets of our nashville facility for impairment 
based on the results of this analysis  we recorded a  non cash impairment charge in the third quarter of to write down the carrying value of long lived assets at our nashville facility to fair value 
general and administrative expenses were  in and  in the decrease was primarily related to lower wages and benefit costs at our dover facility  lower expenses at our nashville facility and from the sale of our memphis facility which was completed in january depreciation and amortization expense decreased to  in as compared to  in the decrease was primarily related to cessation of depreciation after the impairment of all depreciable assets of our nashville facility in the third quarter of net interest expense was  in as compared to  in we reversed  and  in and  respectively  of previously recorded interest expense on uncertain income tax positions which are no longer subject to examination 
excluding the interest expense and reversals we recorded related to uncertain income tax positions  our net interest expense was  in as compared to  in the decrease was due primarily to lower average borrowings as well as a lower average interest rate on our new credit facility entered into on april  on august   we announced that nashville superspeedway notified nascar that it will not seek sanction agreements for its two nationwide series and two camping world truck series events 
we continue to use the track for nascar team testing and are currently evaluating all of our options for the facility 
as a result  we recorded a  provision for contingent obligation reflecting the present value of the estimated portion of the wilson county bonds debt service that may not be covered by the projected sales and incremental property taxes from the facility 
loss earnings from continuing operations before income taxes was  in as compared to  in excluding the non cash impairment charges and provision for contingent obligation  our adjusted earnings from continuing operations before income taxes was  in as compared to  in loss earnings from continuing operations before income taxes non cash impairment charges provision for contingent obligation adjusted earnings from continuing operations before income taxes the above financial information is presented using other than generally accepted accounting principles non gaap and is reconciled to comparable information presented using gaap 
non gaap adjusted earnings from continuing operations before income taxes is derived by adjusting amounts determined in accordance with gaap for the non cash impairment charges and provision for contingent obligation 
we believe such non gaap information is useful and meaningful to investors  and is used by investors and us to assess core operations 
this non gaap financial information may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities and should not be considered as an alternative to earnings loss from continuing operations before income taxes which is determined in accordance with gaap 
our effective income tax rates for and were and  respectively 
the change in our effective income tax rate from the prior year rate was primarily due to the changes in the mix of taxable income and losses within our subsidiaries 
one subsidiary had state taxable income which resulted in state income tax expense  however  other subsidiaries with state tax losses have no state income tax benefits based upon the valuation allowances that we have recorded in connection with state net operating loss carryforwards 
year ended december  vs 
year ended december  admissions revenue was  in as compared to  in the  decrease was primarily related to lower admissions revenue at our nascar event weekends at dover international speedway  fewer events promoted in and to a lesser extent lower admissions at the other events we promoted during we believe the decrease in attendance was attributable primarily to the general downturn in economic conditions  including those affecting disposable consumer income and corporate budgets such as employment  business conditions  interest rates and taxation rates 
we believe that adverse economic trends  particularly credit availability  the decline in consumer confidence and the rise in unemployment have increasingly contributed to the decrease in attendance 
we promoted ten events during and twelve during in  we promoted a nascar nationwide series event and a national hot rod association nhra event at our memphis facility that did not recur in since that facility closed during the fourth quarter of additionally  revenue associated with our special and weekly events at our memphis facility did not recur in event related revenue was  in as compared to  in the  decrease was primarily related to lower hospitality and luxury suite rentals  as well as lower concessions and souvenir sales as a result of the lower attendance and the aforementioned economic conditions 
additionally  revenue associated with the events at our memphis facility did not recur 
broadcasting revenue remained consistent at  in as compared to  in operating and marketing expenses were  in as compared to  in the decrease was primarily related to cost savings from the closing of our memphis facility during the fourth quarter of  cost cutting measures that reduced operating expenses at most major events promoted during and lower costs associated with the decline in event related revenue 
general and administrative expenses were  in and  in the decrease was primarily related to the closing of our memphis facility during the fourth quarter of this decrease was partially offset by the expensing of costs relating to a proposed merger with dover downs gaming entertainment  inc a company related through common ownership 
the merger agreement was terminated in october we closed our memphis motorsports park facility in october and executed an agreement to sell it in december the real estate sale closed on january  after closing costs and including the proceeds from the separate sale of all personal property at the facility  our net proceeds were approximately  all of which was used to pay down indebtedness of the memphis facility 
since the carrying amount of the long lived assets of the memphis facility exceeded the sales price  we recognized a non cash impairment charge of  in the fourth quarter of based upon the expiration of the stock purchase agreement with gulf coast entertainment  llc  the sale of our memphis motorsports park facility was not completed  and as a result  we concluded in the third quarter of that it was necessary for us to review the carrying value of the long lived assets of our memphis facility for impairment 
based on the results of this analysis  we recorded a  non cash impairment charge to write down the carrying value of long lived assets at our memphis facility to fair value 
depreciation and amortization expense remained consistent at  in as compared to  in during  we recognized a gain of  as a result of insurance proceeds received for damage to grandstands at our memphis facility 
net interest expense was  in as compared to  in we reversed  and  in and  respectively  of previously recorded interest expense on uncertain income tax positions which are no longer subject to examination 
excluding the interest expense we recorded related to uncertain income tax positions  our net interest expense was  in as compared to  in the increase was due primarily to a higher average interest rate on our credit facility and the amortization of higher credit facility amendment fees 
earnings loss from continuing operations before income taxes was  in as compared to  in excluding the non cash impairment charges  our adjusted earnings from continuing operations before income taxes was  in as compared to  in earnings loss from continuing operations before income taxes non cash impairment charges adjusted earnings from continuing operations before income taxes the above financial information is presented using other than generally accepted accounting principles non gaap and is reconciled to comparable information presented using gaap 
non gaap adjusted earnings from continuing operations before income taxes is derived by adjusting amounts determined in accordance with gaap for the aforementioned non cash impairment charges 
we believe such non gaap information is useful and meaningful to investors  and is used by investors and us to assess core operations 
this non gaap financial information may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities and should not be considered as an alternative to earnings loss from continuing operations before income taxes which is determined in accordance with gaap 
our effective income tax rates for and were and  respectively 
the change in our effective income tax rate from the prior year rate was primarily due to the changes in the mix of taxable income and losses within our various subsidiaries resulting primarily from the impairment charges 
certain subsidiaries had state taxable income which resulted in state income tax expense  however  other subsidiaries with state tax losses have no state income tax benefits based upon the valuation allowances that we have recorded in connection with state net operating loss carryforwards 
our loss from discontinued operation  net of income tax benefit  increased in as a result of the following we concluded in the second quarter of that it was necessary for us to review the carrying value of the long lived assets of our gateway facility for impairment 
based on the results of this analysis  we recorded a  non cash impairment charge in the second quarter of to write down the carrying value of long lived assets at our gateway facility to fair value 
in november  we announced the closing of our gateway facility 
the gateway facility was located on approximately acres of land in madison  illinois and the racetrack was primarily on leased property 
we had long term leases for approximately acres with four landlords 
in february  three of the four landlords agreed to terminate the land leases in exchange for acres of owned real estate and our agreement to abandon all improvements and certain personal property including the racetrack on the leased land 
as a result  we recorded an expense for facility exit costs of  at december  primarily to record a liability for the value of the real property we conveyed to the landlords in connection with terminating the leases 
we continue to own approximately acres of undeveloped land near the gateway facility 
on july   we redeemed the  of remaining outstanding bonds with southwestern illinois development authority swida for  including a  premium to the bondholders 
the redemption resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of  including the premium  professional fees and the write off of deferred financing costs during liquidity and capital resources our operations and cash flows from operating activities are seasonal in nature with a majority of our motorsports events occurring during the second and fourth quarters this year 
net cash provided by operating activities was  in as compared to  in the increase was primarily due to reduced operating losses at our midwest facilities 
net cash provided by investing activities was  in as compared to  in capital expenditures were  in compared with  in the additions related primarily to replacement of safer barriers at our nashville facility and improvements to our luxury skybox suites at our dover facility 
the additions related primarily to payments for concessions equipment and facility improvements 
we completed the sale of our memphis facility in january which resulted in additional net proceeds of  the decrease in our restricted cash accounts was  in on july   we redeemed all of the outstanding swida bonds and the remaining restricted cash was subsequently returned to us by the trustee 
net cash used in financing activities was  in as compared to  in we had net repayments on our outstanding line of credit of  in as compared to  in repayments of our outstanding swida bonds were  in we incurred  of premiums and fees associated with the aforementioned swida bond redemption in on july   our board of directors voted to suspend the declaration of regular quarterly cash dividends on all classes of our common stock 
dividends are prohibited by our credit facility 
at december   dover motorsports  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries dover international speedway  inc and nashville speedway  usa  inc  as co borrowers  had a  secured credit agreement with a bank group 
there was  outstanding under the credit facility at december   at an interest rate of approximately 
the maximum borrowing limit under the facility reduces to  as of march  and  as of march  and the facility expires april  the credit facility provides for seasonal funding needs  capital improvements  letter of credit requirements and other general corporate purposes 
interest is based upon libor plus a margin that varies between and basis points depending on the leverage ratio basis points at december  
the terms of the credit facility contain certain covenants including minimum interest coverage and maximum funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
material adverse changes in our results of operations could impact our ability to maintain financial ratios necessary to satisfy these requirements 
we expect to be in compliance with the financial covenants  and all other covenants  for all measurement periods during the next twelve months 
in addition  the credit agreement includes a material adverse change clause  prohibits the payment of dividends by us and provides the lenders with a first lien on all of our assets 
the credit facility also provides that if we default under any other loan agreement  that would be a default under this facility 
at december   we were in compliance with the terms of the credit facility 
after consideration of stand by letters of credit outstanding  the remaining maximum borrowings available pursuant to the credit facility were  at december   however  in order to maintain compliance with the required quarterly debt covenant calculations as of december   could have been borrowed as of that date 
on august   we announced that nashville superspeedway had notified nascar that it will not seek sanction agreements for its two nationwide series and two camping world truck series events 
we continue to use the track for nascar team testing and are currently evaluating all of our options for the facility 
we incurred a non cash impairment charge of  and severance costs of approximately  in the third quarter of as a result of this event see note impairment charges of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document for further discussion 
additionally  since the facility will no longer generate sales taxes from these events we have estimated that a portion of the debt service may not be covered by the sales taxes and incremental property taxes applicable taxes 
as a result  we recorded a  provision for contingent obligation reflecting the present value of the estimated portion of the wilson county bonds debt service that may not be covered by applicable taxes from the facility see note commitments and contingencies of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document for further discussion 
an increase in interest rates would result in an increase in the portion of debt service not covered by applicable taxes and therefore an increase in our liability 
in november  we announced the closing of our gateway facility 
the gateway facility was located on approximately acres of land in madison  illinois and the racetrack was primarily on leased property 
we had long term leases for approximately acres with four landlords 
in february  three of the four landlords agreed to terminate the land leases in exchange for acres of owned real estate and our agreement to abandon all improvements and certain personal property including the racetrack on the leased land 
as a result  we recorded an expense for facility exit costs of  at december  primarily to record a liability for the value of the real property we conveyed to the landlords in connection with terminating the leases 
in december  the one remaining land lease was terminated 
we continue to own approximately acres of undeveloped land near the gateway facility 
we closed our memphis motorsports park facility in october and executed an agreement to sell it in december the real estate sale closed on january  after closing costs and including the proceeds from the separate sale of all personal property at the facility in december  our net proceeds were approximately  all of which was used to pay down indebtedness of the memphis facility 
since the carrying amount of the long lived assets of the memphis facility exceeded the sales price  we recognized a non cash impairment charge of  in the fourth quarter of we promoted ten events in and are scheduled to promote six events in  all of which will be sanctioned by nascar and held at our dover international speedway facility 
cash provided by operating activities is expected to substantially fund our capital expenditures 
based on current business conditions  we expect to spend approximately   on capital expenditures during additionally  we expect to contribute approximately  to our pension plans for we expect continued cash flows from operating activities and funds available from our credit agreement to provide for our working capital needs and capital spending requirements at least through the next twelve months and also provide for our long term liquidity 
contractual obligations at december   we had the following contractual obligations and other commercial commitments payments due by period total thereafter revolving line of credit estimated interest payments on revolving line of credit a contingent obligation b operating leases pension contributions total contractual cash obligations a the future interest payments on our revolving credit agreement were estimated using the current outstanding principal as of december  and interest rates under our credit agreement entered into on april  b in september  the sports authority of the county of wilson tennessee issued  in variable rate tax exempt infrastructure revenue bonds  series  to acquire  construct and develop certain public infrastructure improvements which benefit the operation of nashville superspeedway  of which  was outstanding at december  annual principal payments range from  in september to  in and are payable solely from sales taxes and incremental property taxes generated from the facility 
these bonds are direct obligations of the sports authority and therefore have historically not been required to be recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
if the applicable taxes are insufficient for the payment of principal and interest on the bonds  we would become responsible for the difference 
we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates for these bonds 
in the event we were unable to make the payments  they would be made pursuant to a  irrevocable direct pay letter of credit issued by our bank group 
as of december  and   and  respectively  was available in the sales and incremental property tax fund maintained by the sports authority to pay the remaining principal and interest due under the bonds 
during  we paid  into the sales and incremental property tax fund and  was deducted from the fund for principal and interest payments 
if we fail to maintain the letter of credit that secures the bonds or we allow an uncured event of default to exist under our reimbursement agreement relative to the letter of credit  the bonds would be immediately redeemable 
on august   we announced that our wholly owned subsidiary nashville superspeedway had notified nascar that it will not seek sanction agreements for its two nationwide series and two camping world truck series events 
as a result  we recorded a  provision for contingent obligation reflecting the present value of the estimated portion of the wilson county bonds debt service that may not be covered by applicable taxes from the facility 
based on current projections  our first debt service payment would be due in an increase in interest rates would result in an increase in the portion of debt service not covered by applicable taxes and therefore an increase in our liability 
related party transactions see note related party transactions of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document 
critical accounting policies the accounting policies described below are those we consider critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
these policies include significant estimates made by management using information available at the time the estimates are made 
as described below  these estimates could change materially if different information or assumptions were used 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating losses 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
as of december   our valuation allowance net of federal income taxes was  which increased by  in  from reserving for the deferred tax assets related to state net operating loss carry forwards 
these state net operating losses are related to our midwest facilities that have not produced taxable income 
valuation allowances fully reserve the state net operating loss carryforwards  net of federal tax benefit 
we have considered ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize all or a portion of these deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase earnings in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of our remaining deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination was made 
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost 
depreciation is provided for financial reporting purposes using the straight line method over estimated useful lives ranging from to years for furniture  fixtures and equipment and up to years for facilities 
these estimates require assumptions that are believed to be reasonable 
we perform reviews for impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
generally  fair value is determined using valuation techniques such as the comparable sales approach 
historically the impairment assessment for track facilities has also considered the cost approach valuation technique  which gives specific consideration to the value of the track land plus the contributory value to the improvements 
the primary economic assumptions used in the valuation techniques include i land value which is estimated by comparable transactions  and ii that the highest and best use for the facilities is potential real estate development 
changes to these assumptions can have a significant effect on the outcome of future impairment tests and as a result  future valuations could differ significantly from current estimates 
accrued pension cost on june   we decided to freeze participation and benefit accruals under our pension plans 
the freeze was effective july  the benefits provided by our defined benefit pension plans are based on years of service and employee s remuneration through july  accrued pension costs are developed using actuarial principles and assumptions which consider a number of factors  including estimates for the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on assets 
changes in these estimates would impact the amounts that we record in our consolidated financial statements
