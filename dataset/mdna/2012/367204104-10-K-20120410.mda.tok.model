executive overview gas natural is a natural gas company  primarily operating local distribution companies in six states and serving approximately  customers 
our natural gas utility subsidiaries are bangor gas company maine  brainard ohio  cut bank gas montana  energy west montana and wyoming  frontier natural gas north carolina  neo ohio and orwell ohio and pennsylvania 
our operations also include production and marketing of natural gas  gas pipeline transmission  gathering and propane operations 
approximately of our revenues in were derived from our natural gas utility operations 
the following summarizes the critical events that impacted our results of operations in we completed the acquisition of independence  which delivers liquid propane  heating oil and kerosene to approximately  customers in north carolina and virginia 
we plan to expand to other customers within the region 
additionally where feasible  we plan to convert customers from their current source over to natural gas as the cost of natural gas is currently a cheaper and more reliable fuel source 
included in our results in other income is a pre tax gain on the bargain purchase of the assets of independence of  we acquired intrastate pipeline assets in ohio and kentucky and created spelman  which is an intrastate pipeline regulated in ohio 
in ohio  the assets include more than miles of pipeline spanning almost a third of the state from marion to youngstown 
other ohio assets are located in metropolitan and south suburban cleveland 
the kentucky assets include more than miles of right of way to the south of louisville 
spelman intends to recondition and convert the ohio pipelines to transport natural gas to new markets where natural gas service is currently not available  as well as to connect to markets served by our ohio subsidiaries 
the puco has approved spelman s transportation service tariff 
gas natural  neo  orwell and brainard issued million of senior notes to sunlife 
in addition  great plains issued million of senior notes with sunlife 
the use of proceeds for the notes  among other things  extinguished existing amortizing bank debt and other existing indebtedness  funded million for the capital program for orwell and neo  and replenished our treasuries for the previously announced repayment of maturing bank debt and transaction expenses 
we exercised the million accordion feature on the revolving credit facility with bank of america to increase the capacity from million to million 
for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   we experienced growth in revenues and gross margin with a decrease in net income 
net income was  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  in  we experienced increases in revenue and net income from our natural gas operations due primarily to customer growth and colder weather in most of our service territories 
in addition  our newly acquired propane operations reflected net income in primarily as the result of the pre tax gain on the net assets purchased 
these increases were offset by a decrease in net income in from our gas marketing and production operations as a result of lower revenues  gross margin and the impairment of our investment in unconsolidated affiliate 
we also incurred an increased net loss from our corporate and other operations in as the period included dividends and gains on the sale of marketable securities that did not occur in 
table of contents we are focused on building rate base profitably in all of our jurisdictions  maintaining cost discipline  adherence to safety standards  and generating recurring streams of earnings and cash flow that support our continued investment in fixed assets  as well as a return of capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends 
in addition  we are actively pursuing our acquisition strategy to further grow our operations 
our historical financial statements reflect the following reportable business segments natural gas operations  marketing and production  pipeline operations and corporate and other 
in addition  our financial statements now reflect a new segment for propane operations as a result of our acquisition of independence 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation are based upon consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  if any  at the date of the financial statements 
we analyze our estimates  including those related to regulatory assets and liabilities  income taxes and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
see a complete list of significant accounting policies in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
regulatory accounting our accounting policies historically reflect the effects of the rate making process in accordance with regulated operations asc 
our regulated natural gas segment continues to be cost of service rate regulated  and we believe the application of asc to that segment continues to be appropriate 
we must reaffirm this conclusion at each balance sheet date 
if  as a result of a change in circumstances  we determine that the regulated natural gas segment no longer meets the criteria of regulatory accounting under asc  that segment will have to discontinue regulatory accounting and write off the respective regulatory assets and liabilities 
the application of asc results in recording regulatory assets and liabilities 
regulatory assets represent the deferral of incurred costs that are probable of future recovery in customer rates 
in some cases  we record regulatory assets before we have received approval for recovery from the state regulatory agencies 
we must use judgment to conclude that costs deferred as regulatory assets are probable of future recovery 
we base this conclusion on certain factors  including changes in the regulatory environment  recent rate orders issued by regulatory agencies  and the status of any potential new legislation 
regulatory liabilities represent revenues received from customers to fund expected costs that have not yet been incurred or for probable future refunds to customers 
at december   our total regulatory assets were million and our total regulatory liabilities were million 
a write off of the regulatory assets and liabilities could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
our natural gas segment contains regulated utility businesses in the states of maine  montana  north carolina  ohio  pennsylvania  and wyoming and the regulation varies from state to state 
if future recovery of costs  in any such jurisdiction  ceases to be probable  we would be required to charge these assets to current earnings 
however  there are no current or expected proposals or changes in the regulatory environment that impact the probability of future recovery of these assets 
in addition  deregulation would be a change that occurs over time  due to legal processes and procedures  which could moderate the impact to our consolidated financial statements 
our most significant regulatory asset liability relates to the recoverable refundable costs of gas purchases 
we account for purchased gas costs in accordance with procedures authorized by the state regulatory agencies  under which purchased gas costs that are different from those provided for in present rates are accumulated and recovered or credited through future rate changes 

table of contents our gas cost recoveries are monitored closely by the regulatory commissions in all of the states in which we operate 
the gas cost recoveries are adjusted monthly in four of the six states in which we operate  and annually in the other two 
in addition  all of the states in which we operate require us to submit gas procurement plans  which we follow closely 
these plans are reviewed annually by each of the regulatory commissions 
the adjustment of gas cost recoveries and the gas procurement plans reduce the risk of disallowance of recoverable gas costs 
based on our experience  we believe it is highly probable that we will recover the regulatory assets that have been recorded 
during the year ended december   the puco conducted audits of neo and orwell s rates as filed from september through august and january through june  respectively 
the puco provided the primary audit findings during the fourth quarter of  taking the position that neo had not included approximately  of costs and orwell included an excess of approximately  of costs in the filings under audit 
on october   the puco adopted and approved a joint stipulation that finalizes the adjustments for neo and orwell to approximately  and  respectively 
however  the joint stipulation modified the refund period for orwell to one year as compared to two years as originally identified 
we considered the modification to be material and sought rehearing 
on december   the puco affirmed its finding and order requiring orwell s refund to be completed over twelve months 
in accordance with asc  regulated operations  we recorded an adjustment of  and  in our consolidated statements of income for neo and orwell  respectively 
these adjustments appear on our consolidated balance sheet as part of recoverable cost of gas purchases and over recovered gas purchases  respectively 
we recorded the difference between the original estimates and the amounts approved in the joint stipulation during the year ended december  we use our best judgment when recording regulatory assets and liabilities 
regulatory commissions  however  can reach different conclusions about the recovery of costs and those conclusions could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
accumulated provisions for doubtful accounts we encounter risks associated with the collection of our accounts receivable 
as such  we record a provision for those accounts receivable that are considered to be uncollectible 
in order to calculate the appropriate provision  we primarily utilize the historical accounts receivable write off amounts 
the underlying assumptions used for the provision can change from period to period and the provision could potentially cause a material impact to our income statement and working capital 
the actual weather  commodity prices  and other internal and external economic conditions  such as the mix of the customer base between residential  commercial and industrial  may vary significantly from our assumptions and may impact our operating income 
unbilled revenue and gas costs we estimate the gas service that has been rendered from the latest date of each meter reading cycle to the month end 
this estimate of unbilled usage is based on projected base load usage for each day unbilled plus projected weather sensitive usage for each degree day during the unbilled period 
unbilled revenues and gas costs are calculated from the estimate of unbilled usage multiplied by the rates in effect at month end 
each month the estimated unbilled revenue amounts are recorded as revenue and a receivable  and the prior month s estimate is reversed 
likewise  the associated gas costs are recorded as cost of revenue and a payable and the prior month s estimate is reversed 
actual price and usage patterns may vary from these assumptions and may impact revenues recognized and costs recorded 
the critical component of calculating unbilled revenue is estimating the usage on a calendar month basis 
our estimated volumes used in the unbilled revenue calculation have varied from our actual monthly metered volumes by less than plus or minus on december  and december  a variance of on our gross margin from unbilled revenue at december  would have been plus or minus  
table of contents fair value of financial instruments our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  and bank borrowings 
the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the highly liquid nature of these short term instruments 
the fair values of marketable securities are estimated based on closing share price on the quoted market price for those investments 
deferred tax asset and income tax accruals judgment  uncertainty  and estimates are a significant aspect of the income tax accrual process that accounts for the effects of current and deferred income taxes 
uncertainty associated with the application of tax statutes  regulations  and income tax examinations require that judgments and estimates be made in the accrual process 
we have a deferred tax asset of approximately million as of december  related to the carryover tax basis of frontier utilities and penobscot natural gas 
the million deferred tax asset relates to acquisitions of these two subsidiaries during the carryover tax basis is subject to section of the internal revenue code 
due to limitations imposed under section  our tax depreciation is limited in tax years through we have approximately million of carryover tax basis as of december  starting in  we will recognize potential future federal and state income tax benefits of approximately million over the remaining life of the carryover tax basis of the assets 
for the federal income tax purposes  we concluded that the realization of the deferred tax asset associated with the carryover tax basis will be realized in future reporting periods based on future taxable income projections 
for state income tax purposes  we concluded that the realization of the deferred tax asset associated with the carryover tax basis will not be realized  due to state net operating loss carryovers and future state taxable income projections 
as such  management has placed a valuation allowance of approximately million on the state deferred tax assets associated with the carryover tax basis of its subsidiaries acquired during management will reevaluate the valuation allowance each year based on future taxable income projections  and will adjust the deferred tax asset valuation allowance  if based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not  that we will realize some portion or all of the deferred tax assets 
if the projections indicate that we are unable to use all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets  we will adjust the valuation allowance to income tax expense benefit 
the valuation allowance is based on projections of our taxable income in future reporting years 
based on future taxable income projections  our state net operating losses will not be realized  as such  management has placed a valuation allowance of approximately million on the state deferred tax asset associated with state net operating losses 
for the federal tax portion  there is one year remaining of the five year internal revenue code limitation period discussed above 
we estimate that approximately of the tax benefit will be available to us during this one year period 
based on our estimates of taxable income  we project that we will recover approximately of the benefit in the following nine years  with recovered in small increments in the remaining years 
based on this analysis  we believe that a valuation allowance on the federal portion of the benefit is not necessary 
failure to achieve projected levels of profitability could lead to a write down in the deferred tax asset if the recovery period becomes uncertain or longer than expected and could also lead to the expiration of the deferred tax asset between now and  either of which would adversely affect our operating results and financial position 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually  which is completed in the fourth quarter  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired

table of contents capital sources and liquidity sources and uses of cash operating activities provide our primary source of cash 
at december  and  we had approximately million and million of cash on hand  respectively 
cash provided by operating activities consists of net income adjusted for non cash items  including depreciation  depletion  amortization  accretion  deferred income taxes and changes in working capital 
our ability to maintain liquidity depends upon our credit facility with bank of america  shown as line of credit on the accompanying balance sheets 
our use of the bank of america revolving line of credit was million and million at december  and  respectively 
this change in our cash position is primarily due to increases in our capital expenditures due to expansion in our maine and north carolina markets 
we made capital expenditures for continuing operations of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  including million related to the spelman pipeline acquisition in april we finance our capital expenditures on an interim basis by the use of our operating cash flow and use of the bank of america revolving line of credit 
we periodically repay our short term borrowings under the bank of america revolving line of credit by using the net proceeds from the sale of long term debt and equity securities 
long term debt was million and million at december  and december   respectively  including the amount due within one year 
cash  excluding restricted cash  decreased to million at december   compared to million at december  for the years ended december  cash provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities cash provided by financing activities increase decrease in cash operating cash flow for the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities increased by million as compared to the year ended december  major items affecting operating cash included a decrease in accounts receivable collections of million  a million increase in collections of recoverable costs of gas  a million increase in other liabilities based on the accrued taxes other than income  a million decrease in payments on accounts payable  a million increase in unbilled revenue  and a million increase in net deferred taxes 
investing cash flow for the year ended december   cash used in investing activities increased by million as compared to the year ended december  this is primarily due to increased construction expenditures of million  including expenditures of million in for the acquisition of spelman pipeline  million related to acquisition of the net assets of independence oil lp gas  inc in august  and a decrease in the proceeds from sale of marketable securities of million 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures for continuing operations totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  including million related to the spelman pipeline acquisition in april we finance our capital expenditures on an interim basis by the use of our operating cash flow and use of the bank of america revolving line of credit 

table of contents the majority of our capital spending is focused on the growth of our natural gas operations segment 
we conduct ongoing construction activities in all of our utility service areas in order to support expansion  maintenance  and enhancement of our gas pipeline systems 
we are actively expanding our systems in north carolina and maine to meet the high customer interest in natural gas service in those two service areas 
the table below details our capital expenditures for the years ended december  and and provides an estimate of future cash requirements for the year ended december  years ended december  estimated future cash requirements for december  in thousands natural gas operations marketing and production pipeline operations propane operations corporate and other total capital expenditures financing cash flow for the year ended december   cash provided by financing activities decreased by  as compared with the year ended december  the closing of the sunlife transaction increased proceeds from long term debt by million  along with a corresponding increase in repayments of notes payable to pay off existing debt of million 
the sunlife transaction required debt service reserve accounts to be created in the amount of  to cover one year of interest payments 
we are not able to use these funds in the debt service reserve accounts for our operating cash needs 
other items include an increase of  in debt issuance costs  a  increase in dividends paid as a result of the secondary offering in november and an increase in the net line of credit proceeds of million 
we fund our operating cash needs  as well as dividend payments and capital expenditures  primarily through cash flow from operating activities and short term borrowing 
historically  to the extent cash flow has not been sufficient to fund these expenditures  we have used our working capital line of credit 
we have greater need for short term borrowing during periods when internally generated funds are not sufficient to cover all capital and operating requirements  including costs of gas purchased and capital expenditures 
in general  our short term borrowing needs for purchases of gas inventory and capital expenditures are greatest during the summer and fall months and our short term borrowing needs for financing customer accounts receivable are greatest during the winter months 
our ability to maintain liquidity depends upon our credit facility with bank of america  shown as line of credit on the accompanying balance sheets

secondary public offering in november  gas natural completed a million share secondary public offering 
of these shares   were selling shareholder shares and million were primary shares 
the primary shares sold by gas natural include a full exercise of the over allotment option 
gas natural did not receive any of the proceeds from the selling shareholder shares 
net proceeds to gas natural were approximately million after sales concessions  underwriting expenses  and deal expenses 
the primary uses of proceeds are for investment in utility operations as we continue to expand our organic footprint 
additionally  proceeds were used to repay debt of our ohio and pennsylvania utilities 
in november  neo repaid upon maturity a line of credit with citizens bank  na citizens in the amount of million and orwell repaid upon maturity a line of credit with the huntington national bank  
table of contents na huntington in the amount of million and a term loan with huntington in the amount of million 
these loans were secured by all assets of our ohio subsidiaries  as well as a personal guarantee from our chairman and ceo 
these three instruments matured at the end of november these loans were repaid and extinguished with no ability to redraw at this time 
in addition to these loans that had a pending maturity date  a related party demand note was also repaid in november lightning  the intermediate holding company for orwell  had a million unsecured demand note payable with our chairman and ceo  which was repaid in november of  including accrued interest 
citizens bank term loans in connection with the acquisition of our ohio subsidiaries  neo and great plains each entered amendments to its credit facility with citizens 
the credit facility consisted of a revolving line of credit and term loan to neo and two other term loans to great plains 
each amendment was initially effective as of december   but was later modified to be effective as of january  gas natural guaranteed each loan 
mr 
osborne guaranteed each loan both individually and as trustee of the osborne trust  and great plains guaranteed neo s revolving line of credit and term loans 
our ohio subsidiaries had term loans with citizens in the aggregate amount of million 
each term note had a maturity date of july  and bore interest at an annual rate of day libor plus basis points with an interest rate floor of per annum

the fixed rate note  in the amount of million  is a joint obligation of gas natural  neo  orwell and brainard and is guaranteed by gas natural  lightning pipeline and great plains 
prepayment of this note prior to maturity is subject to a basis point make whole premium 
the floating rate note  in the amount of million  is an obligation of great plains and is guaranteed by gas natural 
the note is priced at a fixed spread of basis points over three month libor 
pricing for this note will reset on a quarterly basis to the then current yield of three month libor 
prepayment of this note prior to maturity is at par 
each of the notes is governed by a note purchase agreement 
concurrent with the funding and closing of the notes  which occurred on may   the parties executed amended note purchase agreements that are substantially the same as the note purchase agreements executed on november  the use of proceeds for the notes extinguished existing amortizing bank debt and other existing indebtedness  funded million for the capital program for orwell and neo  established two debt service reserve accounts in the amount of  and replenished the company s treasuries for the previously announced repayment of maturing bank debt and transaction expenses

for the year ended december   the weighted average interest rate on the fixed rate note was  resulting in  of interest expense 
for the year ended december   the weighted average interest rate on the floating rate note was  resulting in  of interest expense 

table of contents for the year ended december   we breached a financial covenant under the note purchase agreements when our ohio subsidiaries made restricted payments in the form of dividends to the holding company in excess of the amounts permissible under the note purchase agreements 
in addition  we did not timely notify sun life of certain of our newly formed subsidiaries which were required to be obligors under the note purchase agreements 
our failure to timely notify sun life constituted a breach of the note purchase agreements 
we requested that sun life waive these breaches and amend the financial covenants

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to certain market risks  including commodity price risk ie  natural gas prices and interest rate risk 
the adverse effects of potential changes in these market risks are discussed below 
the sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity nor do they consider additional actions management may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes 
actual results may differ 
commodity price risk we seek to protect ourself against natural gas price fluctuations by limiting the aggregate level of net open positions that are exposed to market price changes 
we manage such open positions with policies that are designed to limit the exposure to market risk  with regular reporting to management of potential financial exposure 
our risk management committee has limited the types of contracts we will consider to those related to physical natural gas deliveries 
therefore  management believes that although revenues and cost of sales are impacted by changes in natural gas prices  our margin is not significantly impacted by these changes 
credit risk credit risk relates to the risk of loss that we would incur as a result of non performance by counterparties of their contractual obligations under the various instruments with us 
credit risk may be concentrated to the extent that one or more groups of counterparties have similar economic  industry or other characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in market or other conditions 
in addition  credit risk includes not only the risk that a counter party may default due to circumstances relating directly to it  but also the risk that a counterparty may default due to circumstances that relate to other market participants that have a direct or indirect relationship with such counterparty 
we seek to mitigate credit risk by evaluating the financial strength of potential counterparties 
however  despite mitigation efforts  defaults by counterparties may occur from time to time 
to date  no such default has occurred
