item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition executive summary of consolidated results of operations in this discussion and analysis  the company analyzes contributions to consolidated earnings and earnings per share from its utility group and nonutility group separately since each operates independently requiring distinct competencies and business strategies  offers different energy and energy related products and services  and experiences different opportunities and risks 
the utility group generates revenue primarily from the delivery of natural gas and electric service to its customers 
the primary source of cash flow for the utility group results from the collection of customer bills and the payment for goods and services procured for the delivery of gas and electric services 
the activities of  and revenues and cash flows generated by  the nonutility group are closely linked to the utility industry  and the results of those operations are generally impacted by factors similar to those impacting the overall utility industry 
in addition  there are other operations  referred to herein as corporate and other  that include unallocated corporate expenses such as advertising and charitable contributions  among other activities 
the company has in place a disclosure committee that consists of senior management as well as financial management 
the committee is actively involved in the preparation and review of the company s sec filings 
net income and earnings per share  in total and by group  for the years ended december    and follow year ended december  in millions  except per share data net income attributed to utility group nonutility group corporate other basic earnings per share attributed to utility group nonutility group corporate other results for the year ended december   consolidated net income was million  or per share  compared to earnings of million  or per share in and million  or per share in in  the company advanced initiatives to grow its nonutility infrastructure services segment  to reduce exposure to volatile commodity related businesses  and to permit its utilities to earn their allowed returns 
during the first quarter of  the company purchased minnesota limited  a transmission pipe construction company 
earnings were favorably impacted by this acquisition along with increased demand in the services offered by the nonutility infrastructure services segment 
during the fourth quarter of  the company sold its wholly owned retail natural gas marketer  vectren source 
new base rates were established in the company s electric utility service territory in may providing for the opportunity to earn on the million of rate base added since the last base rate case 
further  multiple utility group refinancing transactions were completed in at favorable interest rates 
natural gas market conditions continued to impact the company s investment in wholesale energy marketer proliance holdings  llc  and the continued soft real estate market resulted in impairment charges associated with legacy real estate holdings 
these transactions  along with other operating trends  are further described below 

table of contents utility group during  the utility group earned million  compared to million earned in and million earned in the results in reflect an increase in earnings from electric operations and slightly lower earnings from gas operations 
utility results also include an unfavorable income tax adjustment associated with the sale of vectren source 
the increase in compared to results from the return of large customer usage  summer cooling weather that was significantly warmer than normal and the prior year  and lower operating expenses 
gas utility services the gas utility segment earned million during the year ended december   compared to earnings of million in and million in results over the periods presented have been impacted by continued growth in large customer margin and return on bare steel  cast iron  and distribution riser replacement activities in ohio 
in increased operating expenses associated with planned maintenance activities  environmental remediation efforts  and a brief work stoppage related to bargaining unit labor negotiations unfavorably impacted year over year trends 
in results were favorably impacted by the phased implementation of a straight fixed variable rate design in the ohio service territory and by lower operating expenses 
electric utility services the electric operations earned million during  compared to million in and million in the year ended has been positively impacted by new electric base rates implemented on may  and negatively impacted by summer weather that  while warmer than normal  was cooler than the extreme summer temperatures in earnings in were also reduced by increased power supply operating expenses associated with planned electric generating maintenance activities 
the increase in compared to is principally due to extreme summer weather and increased large customer margins 
management estimates the impact of weather on electric margin  compared to normal temperatures  to be approximately million favorable in this compares to  where management estimated a million favorable impact on margin compared to normal 
in summer cooling weather was percent warmer than normal 
in  there was mild cooling weather  and management estimates the impact on electric margin to be million unfavorable compared to normal in that year 
although summer temperatures were warmer than normal in  year over year compared to  there was a decline in earnings of approximately million after tax  or per share 
in compared to  there was an estimated increase of million after tax  or per share  due to electric weather 
other utility operations in earnings from other utility operations were million compared to million in and million in the decrease in is primarily due to a higher effective income tax rate 
the higher income tax rate results primarily from the revaluation of existing utility group deferred income taxes as a result of the fourth quarter sale of vectren source 
the charge to income taxes as a result of the revaluation was approximately million 
nonutility group in  nonutility group earnings were million compared to earnings of million in and million in the infrastructure services  energy services  and coal mining operations combined for million of earnings contribution in compared to million of earnings contribution in and million in in  infrastructure services earnings increased million compared to  driven by increased demand and the minnesota limited acquisition 
coal mining earnings also increased million year over year due to increased third party sales resulting from the opening of oaktown both and reflect reduced optimization opportunities at proliance  which resulted in its contribution to vectren s results being a loss of million in and million in in proliance contributed earnings of approximately million  before the impacts of an impairment charge associated with an investment in a storage asset held by proliance the liberty charge 
overall results were impacted by the sale of retail natural gas marketer vectren source in and certain charges throughout the years presented 
in  the sale of vectren source  net of transaction costs  resulted in a pretax gain of million 
after current taxes and the impact of the revaluation of deferred taxes resulting from the sale of million million at the utility group and million at the nonutility group  the after tax consolidated gain was approximately million 
legacy real estate charges totaled million  or million after tax  in results in were also impacted by charges related to legacy investments totaling million after tax  and contains an million after tax charge associated with the liberty charge 
in the consolidated financial statements  note describes the sale of vectren source  note describes the legacy investment charges  and note describes the liberty charge 

table of contents corporate other the results in corporate and other primarily reflect a contribution to the vectren foundation  a c charitable organization  totaling million  or after tax 
the contribution is reflected in other operating expenses in the consolidated financial statements 
dividends dividends declared for the year ended december  were per share  compared to in and per share in in november  the company s board of directors increased its quarterly dividend to per share from per share 
the increase marks the nd consecutive year vectren and predecessor companies have increased annual dividends paid 
use of non gaap performance measures and per share measures per share earnings contributions of the utility group  nonutility group  and corporate and other are presented and are non gaap measures 
such per share amounts are based on the earnings contribution of each group included in vectren s consolidated results divided by vectren s basic average shares outstanding during the period 
the earnings per share of the groups do not represent a direct legal interest in the assets and liabilities allocated to the groups  but rather represent a direct equity interest in vectren corporation s assets and liabilities as a whole 
these non gaap measures are used by management to evaluate the performance of individual businesses 
in addition  other items giving rise to period over period variances  such as weather  are presented on an after tax and per share basis 
these amounts are calculated at a statutory tax rate divided by vectren s basic average shares outstanding during the period 
accordingly  management believes these measures are useful to investors in understanding each business contribution to consolidated earnings per share and in analyzing consolidated period to period changes and the potential for earnings per share contributions in future periods 
reconciliations of the non gaap measures to their most closely related gaap measure of consolidated earnings per share are included throughout this discussion and analysis 
the non gaap financial measures disclosed by the company should not be considered a substitute for  or superior to  financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap  and the financial results calculated in accordance with gaap 
detailed discussion of results of operations following is a more detailed discussion of the results of operations of the company s utility and nonutility operations 
the detailed results of operations for these groups are presented and analyzed before the reclassification and elimination of certain intersegment transactions necessary to consolidate those results into the company s consolidated statements of income 

table of contents results of operations of the utility group the utility group is comprised of utility holdings operations and consists of the company s regulated operations and other operations that provide information technology and other support services to those regulated operations 
regulated operations consist of a natural gas distribution business that provides natural gas distribution and transportation services to nearly two thirds of indiana and to west central ohio and an electric transmission and distribution business  which provides electric distribution services primarily to southwestern indiana  and the company s power generating and wholesale power operations 
in total  these regulated operations supply natural gas and or electricity to over one million customers 
utility group operating results before certain intersegment eliminations and reclassifications for the years ended december    and  follow year ended december  in millions  except per share data operating revenues gas utility electric utility other total operating revenues operating expenses cost of gas sold cost of fuel purchased power other operating depreciation amortization taxes other than income taxes total operating expenses operating income other income net interest expense income before income taxes income taxes net income contribution to vectren basic eps trends in utility operations the regulatory environment gas and electric operations  with regard to retail rates and charges  terms of service  accounting matters  financing  and certain other operational matters specific to its indiana customers the operations of sigeco and indiana gas  are regulated by the iurc 
the retail gas operations of vedo are subject to regulation by the puco 
over the last five years  orders establishing new base rates have been received by each utility 
sigeco s electric territory received an order in april  effective may  and its gas territory received an order in august indiana gas received its most recent base rate order in february and vedo in january the orders authorize a return on equity ranging from percent to percent 
the authorized returns reflect the impact of innovative rate design strategies having been authorized by these state commissions 
outside of a full base rate proceeding  these innovative approaches to some extent mitigate the impacts of investments in government mandated projects  operating costs that are volatile or that increase with government mandates  and changing consumption patterns 
in addition to timely gas and fuel cost recovery  approximately million of the utility group s approximate million in other operating expenses incurred during are subject to a recovery mechanism outside of base rates 
in  state laws in both indiana and ohio were passed that expand the ability of utilities to recover certain costs of federally mandated projects  and in ohio other projects  outside of a base rate proceeding 
therefore  utilization of these mechanisms will likely increase in the coming years 

table of contents rate design strategies sales of natural gas and electricity to residential and commercial customers are seasonal and are impacted by weather 
trends in average use among natural gas residential and commercial customers have tended to decline as more efficient appliances and furnaces are installed and the company s utilities have implemented conservation programs 
in the company s two indiana natural gas service territories  normal temperature adjustment nta and lost margin recovery mechanisms largely mitigate the effect that would otherwise be caused by variations in volumes sold to these customers due to weather and changing consumption patterns 
the ohio natural gas service territory has a straight fixed variable rate design 
this rate design  which was fully implemented in february  mitigates most of the ohio service territory s weather risk and risk of decreasing consumption 
prior to the implementation of this rate design  the ohio service territory had a lost margin recovery mechanism 
in all natural gas service territories  commissions have authorized bare steel and cast iron replacement programs 
sigeco s electric service territory currently recovers certain transmission investments outside of base rates 
the electric service territory has neither an nta nor a decoupling mechanism  however  rate designs provide for a lost margin recovery mechanism that works in tandem with conservation initiatives 
tracked operating expenses gas costs and fuel costs incurred to serve indiana customers are two of the company s most significant operating expenses 
rates charged to natural gas customers in indiana contain a gas cost adjustment gca clause 
the gca clause allows the company to timely charge for changes in the cost of purchased gas  inclusive of unaccounted for gas expense based on historical experience 
electric rates contain a fuel adjustment clause fac that allows for timely adjustment in charges for electric energy to reflect changes in the cost of fuel 
the net energy cost of purchased power  subject to an approved variable benchmark based on nymex natural gas prices  is also timely recovered through the fac 
gca and fac procedures involve periodic filings and iurc hearings to establish the amount of price adjustments for a designated future period 
the procedures also provide for inclusion in later periods of any variances between actual recoveries representing the estimated costs and actual costs incurred 
the iurc has also applied the statute authorizing gca and fac procedures to reduce rates when necessary to limit net operating income to a level authorized in its last general rate order through the application of an earnings test 
these earnings tests have not had any material impact to the company s recent operating results and are not expected to have any material impact in the foreseeable future 
since october of  the company has not been the supplier of natural gas in its ohio territory 
in indiana  gas pipeline integrity management costs  costs to fund energy efficiency programs  miso costs  and the gas cost component of uncollectible accounts expense based on historical experience are recovered by mechanisms outside of standard base rate recovery 
certain operating costs  including depreciation  associated with operating environmental compliance equipment at electric generation facilities and regional electric transmission investments are also recovered outside of base rates when the associated asset is recovered outside of base rates 
in ohio  expenses such as uncollectible accounts expense  costs associated with exiting the merchant function  and costs associated with a distribution replacement program are subject to recovery outside of base rates 
revenues and margins are also impacted by the collection of state mandated taxes  which primarily fluctuate with gas and fuel costs 
see the rate and regulatory matters section of this discussion and analysis for more specific information on significant proceedings involving the company s utilities over the last three years 
utility group margin throughout this discussion  the terms gas utility margin and electric utility margin are used 
gas utility margin is calculated as gas utility revenues less the cost of gas sold 
electric utility margin is calculated as electric utility revenues less cost of fuel purchased power 
the company believes gas utility and electric utility margins are better indicators of relative contribution than revenues since gas prices and fuel and purchased power costs can be volatile and are generally collected on a dollar for dollar basis from customers 
following is a discussion and analysis of margin generated from regulated utility operations 

table of contents gas utility margin gas utility revenues less cost of gas sold gas utility margin and throughput by customer type follows year ended december  in millions gas utility revenues cost of gas sold total gas utility margin margin attributed to residential commercial customers industrial customers other sold transported volumes in mmdth attributed to residential commercial customers industrial customers total sold transported volumes over the three years ended december   volumes sold to residential and commercial customers have been impacted by weather  lower gas prices  conservation initiatives  and changing consumption patterns 
however  the impact on margin has been generally offset as planned by rate design strategies 
large customer volumes were impacted by the recession  falling approximately percent in with the economy stabilizing in  volumes in returned to pre recession levels with additional growth in the recovery from the recession and increasing ethanol production were the principal reasons for the change in large customer margin over the years presented 
the average cost per dekatherm of gas purchased during was  compared to in and in gas utility margins were million for year ended december   and compared to decreased million 
margin decreased million year over year due to lower revenue taxes and operating costs recovered in margin 
management estimates a decrease of million due to ohio rate design changes  as described below 
returns generated on investments in bare steel cast iron and distribution riser replacement in ohio increased margins million year over year 
large customer margin  net of the impacts of regulatory initiatives and tracked costs  increased by million due primarily to ethanol producers 
for the year ended december   gas utility margins increased million compared to management estimates an increase of million due to ohio rate design changes  as described below 
large customer margin  net of the impacts of regulatory initiatives and tracked costs  increased by million due primarily to increased volumes sold 
margin decreased million due to lower miscellaneous revenues and other revenues associated with lower gas costs 
the remaining decrease is primarily due to a million decrease for lower operating expenses and revenue taxes directly recovered in margin 
the rate design approved by the puco on january   and initially implemented on february   allowed for the phased movement toward a straight fixed variable rate design 
this rate design places substantially all of the fixed cost recovery in the monthly customer service charge 
this rate design mitigates most weather risk as well as the effects of declining usage  similar to the company s lost margin recovery mechanism in place in the indiana natural gas service territories and the mechanism in place in ohio prior to this rate order 
since the straight fixed variable rate design was fully implemented in february  nearly percent of the combined residential and commercial base rate gas margins were recovered through the customer service charge 
as a result of the timing of this conversion  margin in was favorably impacted by the volumetric rate design in place during the peak delivery winter months of january and the first half of february 
margin recognized in reflects the full implementation of the rate design which resulted in a decrease in margin in compared to 
table of contents electric utility margin electric utility revenues less cost of fuel purchased power electric utility margin and volumes sold by customer type follows year ended december  in millions electric utility revenues cost of fuel purchased power total electric utility margin margin attributed to residential commercial customers industrial customers municipals other customers subtotal retail wholesale margin total electric utility margin electric volumes sold in gwh attributed to residential commercial customers industrial customers municipals other total retail firm wholesale volumes sold retail electric retail utility margins were million for the year ended december  and compared to increased by million 
the impact of new base rates increased margin million 
management estimates the impact of weather  which was warmer than normal but cooler compared to the prior year  to have decreased residential and commercial margin million 
margin increased million year over year due to increased miso operating costs that are directly recovered in margin 
in  electric retail utility margins increased million compared to management estimates the impact of warmer than normal weather to have increased residential and commercial margin million year over year 
management also estimates industrial margins  net of the impacts of regulatory initiatives and recovery of tracked costs  to have increased approximately million year over year due primarily to increased volumes 
margin among the customer classes associated with returns on pollution control investments increased million  and margin associated with tracked costs such as recovery of miso and pollution control operating expenses increased million 
margin from wholesale electric activities periodically  generation capacity is in excess of native load 
the company markets and sells this unutilized generating and transmission capacity to optimize the return on its owned assets 
substantially all off system sales occur into the miso day ahead and real time markets 
further detail of wholesale activity follows year ended december  in millions transmission system margin off system margin total wholesale margin the company earns a return on electric transmission projects constructed by the company in its service territory that meet the criteria of miso s regional transmission expansion plans 
margin associated with these projects  including the reconciliation of recovery mechanisms  and other transmission system operations  totaled million during  compared to million in and million in increases are primarily due to increased investment in qualifying projects 

table of contents one such project currently under construction meeting these expansion plan criteria is an interstate kv transmission line that connects vectren s ab brown generating station to a station in indiana owned by duke energy to the north and will connect to a station in kentucky owned by big rivers electric corporation to the south 
during the construction of these transmission assets and while these assets are in service  sigeco will recover an approximate percent return  inclusive of the ferc approved equity rate of return of percent  on capital investments through a rider mechanism which is projected annually and reconciled the following year based on actual results 
of the total investment  which is expected to approximate million  the company has invested approximately million as of december  the north leg of this expansion was placed in service in november  and the south leg of this project is expected to be operational in for the year ended december   margin from off system sales was million  compared to million in and million in the base rate changes implemented in may require that wholesale margin from off system sales earned above or below million be shared equally with customers 
this compares to a million sharing threshold established in results for the periods presented reflect the impact of that sharing 
off system sales totaled gwh in  compared to gwh in  and gwh in utility group operating expenses other operating for the year ended december   other operating expenses were million  and compared to reflect an increase of million 
the increase is primarily attributable to higher electric power supply operating expenses 
such expenses increased million year over year with million attributed to planned outage maintenance and million attributed to variable production costs 
the remaining variance is primarily attributable to higher planned energy delivery costs 
for the year ended december   other operating expenses decreased million compared to excluding expenses tracked directly in margin  operating costs decreased million 
there was a million reduction in indiana uncollectible accounts expense 
and in  the company incurred million related to environmental remediation efforts 
depreciation amortization for the year ended december   depreciation and amortization expense was million  compared to million in and million in these increases reflect utility investments placed into service 
the higher deprecation as a result of increasing rate base was offset by lower amortization of certain deferred costs pursuant to the may electric base rate order 
such decreased amortizations were million in taxes other than income taxes taxes other than income taxes decreased million in compared to and decreased million in compared to the decreases are primarily attributable to lower ohio excise and usage taxes associated with that territory s ongoing process of exiting the merchant function  which started in the second quarter of these taxes are primarily revenue related taxes and are offset dollar for dollar with lower gas utility revenues 
other income net other income net reflects income of million in  compared to million in and million in the declines among the years principally reflect lower returns associated with investments that fund benefit plans 
the earnings in reflect the partial recovery of those investments from the significant market declines in associated with the recession 
interest expense for year ended december   interest expense was million  and is a slight decrease compared to the decrease is primarily due to fourth quarter refinancing activity in which million of long term debt with a percent interest rate matured and was replaced with million of new long term debt with an average interest rate of percent and million of short term borrowings 
during the fourth quarter  the company also called million of long term debt at a rate of percent and replaced that issuance in february with new debt at a rate of percent 
the impacts of refinancing at lower rates will decrease interest more significantly in 
table of contents the million increase in compared to reflects the impact of long term financing transactions completed in  offset by lower interest from less debt outstanding overall 
the long term financing transactions completed in include a second quarter issuance by utility holdings of million in unsecured eleven year notes with an interest rate of percent and a third quarter completion by sigeco of a million debt issuance of year tax exempt first mortgage bonds with an interest rate of percent 
income taxes in  utility group federal and state income taxes were million  compared to million in and million in the million increase in primarily reflects a higher effective income tax rate 
the higher income tax rate includes a million charge that results from the revaluation of existing utility group deferred income taxes as a result of the fourth quarter sale of vectren source 
federal and state income taxes increased million in compared to the increase is primarily impacted by greater pre tax income in and no manufacturing tax deduction in as a result of significant bonus depreciation driving down qualifying income 
in addition  the lower effective tax rate in reflects a greater share of taxable income in states with low  or no  state income taxes 
legislative matters pipeline safety law on january  the pipeline safety  regulatory certainty and job creation act of was signed into law 
this new law  which reauthorizes federal pipeline safety programs through fiscal year  provides for enhanced safety  reliability and environmental protection in the transportation of energy products by pipeline 
the new law increases federal enforcement authority  grants the federal government expanded authority over pipeline safety  provides for new safety regulations and standards  and authorizes or requires the completion of several pipeline safety related studies 
the dot is required to promulgate a number of new regulatory requirements 
the direction of those regulations will be based on the results of the studies and reports required or authorized by the new law and may eventually lead to further regulatory or statutory requirements 
the company continues to study the impact of the new law and potential new regulations associated with its implementation 
at this time  compliance costs and other effects associated with the increased pipeline safety regulations remain uncertain 
however  the new law is expected to result in further investment in pipeline inspections  and where necessary  additional modernization of pipeline infrastructure  and therefore  result in both increased levels of operating expenses and capital expenditures associated with the company s natural gas distribution businesses 
operating expenses associated with expanded compliance requirements may grow to approximately million annually  with million attributable to the indiana operations 
the company expects to seek recovery under senate bill referenced below  or such costs may be recoverable through current tracking mechanisms 
capital investments  driven by the pipeline safety regulations  associated with the company s indiana gas utilities are expected to be approximately million over the next five years  which would likely qualify as federally mandated regulatory requirements 
in ohio  capital investments are expected to be approximately million over the next five years 
the company expects to seek recovery of capital investments associated with complying with these federal mandates in accordance with senate bill in indiana and house bill in ohio referenced below 
indiana house bill in may  house bill was signed into law 
this legislation phases in over four years a two percent rate reduction to the indiana adjusted gross income tax for corporations 
pursuant to house bill  the tax rate will be lowered by one half percent each year beginning on july   to the final rate of six and one half percent effective july  pursuant to fasb guidance  the company accounted for the effect of the change in tax law on its deferred taxes in the second quarter of  the period of enactment 
the impact was not material to results of operations or financial condition as the decrease in deferred tax liabilities was generally offset by a million decrease in regulatory assets 
indiana senate bill in april  senate bill was signed into law 
while the bill is broad in scope  it allows for cost recovery outside of a base rate proceeding for federal government mandated projects and provides for a voluntary clean energy portfolio standard 

table of contents the law applies to both gas and electric utility operations and provides a framework to recover percent of federally mandated costs through a periodic rate adjustment mechanism outside of a general rate case 
such costs include construction  depreciation  operating and other costs 
the remaining percent of those costs are to be deferred for recovery in the utility s next general rate case 
the company is currently evaluating the impact this law may have on its operations  including applicability to expenditures associated with the integrity  safety  and reliable operation of natural gas pipelines and facilities  ash disposal  water regulations  and air pollution  including greenhouse gas emissions  among other federally mandated projects and potential projects 
the legislation establishes a voluntary clean energy portfolio standard that provides incentives to electricity suppliers participating in the program 
the goal of the program is that by  at least percent of the total electricity obtained by the supplier to meet the energy needs of its indiana retail customers will be provided by clean energy sources  as defined 
the financial incentives include an enhanced return on equity and tracking mechanisms to recover program costs 
in advance of a federal portfolio standard and senate bill  sigeco received regulatory approval to purchase a mw landfill gas generation facility from a related entity 
the facility was purchased in and is directly connected to the company s distribution system 
in  the company also executed a long term purchase power commitment for mw of wind energy 
these transactions supplement a mw wind energy purchase power agreement executed in before the impacts of efficiency measures  the company currently stands at approximately percent of its electricity being provided by clean energy sources due to the long term wind contracts and landfill gas investments 
the company continues to evaluate whether to participate in this voluntary program 
ohio house bill in june  ohio house bill was signed into law 
the law adjusts  among other things  the manner in which gas utilities file for rate changes  including the implementation of base rate changes  alternative rate plans  and automatic rate adjustment mechanisms 
outside of a base rate proceeding  the legislation permits a natural gas company to apply to implement a capital expenditure program for infrastructure expansion  upgrade  or replacement  installation  upgrade  or replacement of information technology systems  or any program necessary to comply with government regulation 
once such application is approved  the legislation authorizes recovery or deferral of program costs  such as depreciation  property taxes  and carrying costs 
the company is assessing the impact this legislation may have on its operations 
on february   the company initiated a filing under house bill this filing requests accounting authority to defer depreciation  post in service carrying costs and property taxes for its approximate million capital expenditure program 
the capital expenditure program includes infrastructure expansion and improvements not covered by the company s distribution replacement rider as well as expenditures necessary to comply with puco rules  regulations and orders 
a procedural schedule associated with the filing has not yet been set 
environmental matters air quality cross state air pollution rule formerly clean air interstate rule cair on july   epa finalized the cross state air pollution rule csapr 
cspar is the epa s response to the us court of appeals for the district of columbia s the court remand of the clean air interstate rule cair 
cair was originally established in as an allowance cap and trade program that required reductions from coal burning power plants for nox emissions beginning january  and so emissions beginning january   with a second phase of reductions in in an effort to address the court s finding that cair did not adequately ensure attainment of pollutants in certain downwind states due to unlimited trading of soand nox allowances  cspar reduces the ability of facilities to meet emission reduction targets through allowance trading 
like cair  cspar sets individual state caps for soand nox emissions 
however  unlike cair in which states allocated allowances through state implementation plans  cspar allowances were allocated to individual units directly through the federal rule 
as finalized  csapr requires a percent reduction of so emissions compared to national levels and a percent reduction of nox emissions compared to national levels and that such reductions are to be achieved with initial step reductions beginning january   with final compliance to be achieved in multiple administrative and judicial challenges have been filed  including requests to stay cspar s implementation 
on december   the court granted a stay of cspar and ordered expedited briefing schedules be submitted by january   that would allow for completion of briefing and a hearing in april two primary issues are before the court for review epa s use of air modeling data as opposed to exclusive reliance on actual monitoring data to support state contribution levels  and epa s allocation of allowances directly through a federal implementation plan as opposed to setting state caps and providing states the opportunity to submit individual state implementation plans 
in addition  there are initiatives in the congress that  if adopted  would suspend cspar s implementation 

table of contents utility hazardous air pollutants haps rule on december   the epa finalized the utility haps rule 
the haps rule is the epa s response to the us court of appeals for the district of columbia vacating the clean air mercury rule camr in camr was originally established in as a nation wide mercury emission allowance cap and trade system which sought to reduce utility emissions of mercury starting in the haps rule sets emission limits for hazardous air pollutants for existing and new coal fired power plants and identifies the following broad categories of hazardous air pollutants mercury  non mercury hazardous air pollutants primarily arsenic  chromium  cobalt  and selenium and acid gases hydrogen cyanide  hydrogen chloride  and hydrogen fluoride 
the rule imposes mercury emission limits for two sub categories of coal  and proposed surrogate limits for non mercury and acid gas hazardous air pollutants 
the epa did not grant blanket compliance extensions  but asserted that states have broad authority to grant one year extensions for individual units where potential reliability impacts have been demonstrated 
reductions are to be achieved within three years of publication of the final rule in the federal register early 
initiatives to suspend cspar s implementation by the congress also apply to the implementation of the haps rule 
conclusions regarding air regulations to comply with indiana s implementation plan of the clean air act  and other federal air quality standards  the company obtained authority from the iurc to invest in clean coal technology 
using this authorization  the company invested approximately million starting in with the last equipment being placed into service on january  the pollution control equipment included selective catalytic reduction scr systems  fabric filters  and an so scrubber at its generating facility that is jointly owned with alcoa the company s portion is mw 
scr technology is the most effective method of reducing nox emissions where high removal efficiencies are required and fabric filters control particulate matter emissions 
the unamortized portion of the million clean coal technology investment was included in rate base for purposes of determining sigeco s new electric base rates approved in the latest base rate order obtained april  sigeco s coal fired generating fleet is percent scrubbed for so and percent controlled for nox 
utilization of the company s nox and so allowances can be impacted as these regulations are revised and implemented 
most of these allowances were granted to the company at zero cost  therefore  any reduction in carrying value that could result from future changes in regulations would be immaterial 
the company is currently reviewing the sufficiency of its existing pollution control equipment in relation to the requirements described in cspar and the utility haps rule 
based upon an initial review of the final rules  including minor revisions made to cspar in october  the company believes that it will be able to meet these requirements with its existing suite of pollution control equipment and the anticipated allotment of new emission allowances 
however  it is possible some minor modifications to the control equipment and additional operating expenses could be required 
the company believes that such additional costs  if necessary  would be recoverable under indiana senate bill referenced above 
water section b of the clean water act requires that generating facilities use the best technology available to minimize adverse environmental impacts in a body of water 
more specifically  section b is concerned with impingement and entrainment of aquatic species in once through cooling water intake structures used at electric generating facilities 
in april  the us supreme court affirmed that the epa could  but was not required to  consider costs and benefits in making the evaluation as to the best technology available for existing generating facilities 
the regulation was remanded back to the epa for further consideration 
in march  the epa released its proposed section b regulations 
the epa did not mandate the retrofitting of cooling towers in the proposed regulation  but if finalized the regulation will leave it to the state to determine whether cooling towers should be required on a case by case basis 
a final rule is expected in depending on the final rule and on the company s facts and circumstances  capital investments could be in the million range if new infrastructure  such as new cooling water towers  is required 
costs for compliance with these final regulations would likely qualify as federally mandated regulatory requirements under indiana senate bill referenced above 

table of contents coal ash waste disposal ash ponds in june  the epa issued proposed regulations affecting the management and disposal of coal combustion products  such as ash generated by the company s coal fired power plants 
the proposed rules more stringently regulate these byproducts and would likely increase the cost of operating or expanding existing ash ponds and the development of new ash ponds 
the alternatives include regulating coal combustion by products that are not being beneficially reused as hazardous waste 
the epa did not offer a preferred alternative  but took public comment on multiple alternative regulations 
rules may not be finalized in given oversight hearings  congressional interest  and other factors 
at this time  the majority of the company s ash is being beneficially reused 
however  the alternatives proposed would require some retrofitting or closure of existing ash ponds 
the company estimates capital expenditures to comply could be as much as million  and such expenditures could exceed million if the most stringent of the alternatives is selected 
annual compliance costs could increase slightly or be impacted by as much as million 
costs for compliance with these regulations would likely qualify as federally mandated regulatory requirements under senate bill referenced above 
climate change vectren is committed to responsible environmental stewardship and conservation efforts and if a national climate change policy is implemented believes it should have the following elements an inclusive scope that involves all sectors of the economy and sources of greenhouse gases  and recognizes early actions and investments made to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions  provisions for enhanced use of renewable energy sources as a supplement to base load coal generation including effective energy conservation  demand side management  and generation efficiency measures  a flexible market based cap and trade approach with zero cost allowance allocations to coal fired electric generators 
the approach should have a properly designed economic safety valve in order to reduce or eliminate extreme price spikes and potential price volatility 
a long lead time must be included to align nearer term technology capabilities and expanded generation efficiency and other enhanced renewable strategies  ensuring that generation sources will rely less on natural gas to meet short term carbon reduction requirements 
this new regime should allow for adequate resource and generation planning and remove existing impediments to efficiency enhancements posed by the current new source review provisions of the clean air act  inclusion of incentives for investment in advanced clean coal technology and support for research and development  a strategy supporting alternative energy technologies and biofuels and increasing the domestic supply of natural gas to reduce dependence on foreign oil and imported natural gas  and the allocation of zero cost allowances to natural gas distribution companies if those companies are required to hold allowances for the benefit of the end use customer 
the company emits greenhouse gases ghg primarily from its fossil fuel electric generation plants 
the company uses methodology described in the acid rain program under title iv of the clean air act to calculate its level of direct co emissions from its fossil fuel electric generating plants 
the company s direct co emissions from its plants over the past years are represented below in thousands direct co emissions tons based on data made available through the electronic greenhouse gas reporting tool e grrt maintained by the epa  the company s direct co emissions from its fossil fuel electric generation that report under the acid rain program were less than one half of one percent of all emissions in the united states from similar sources 
emissions from other company operations  including those from its natural gas distribution operations and the greenhouse gas emissions the company is required to report on behalf of its end use customers  are similarly available through the epa s e grrt database and reporting tool 

table of contents current initiatives to increase conservation reduce emissions the company is committed to a policy that reduces greenhouse gas emissions and conserves energy usage 
evidence of this commitment includes focusing the company s mission statement and purpose on corporate sustainability and the need to help customers conserve and manage energy costs  building a renewable energy portfolio to complement base load coal fired generation in advance of mandated renewable energy portfolio standards  implementing conservation initiatives in the company s indiana and ohio gas utility service territories  implementing conservation and demand side management initiatives in the electric service territory  evaluating potential carbon requirements with regard to new generation  other fuel supply sources  and future environmental compliance plans  reducing the company s carbon footprint by measures such as utilizing hybrid vehicles and optimizing generation efficiencies by utilizing dense pack technology  and developing renewable energy and energy efficiency performance contracting projects through its wholly owned subsidiary  energy systems group 
legislative actions other climate change initiatives in april  the us supreme court determined that greenhouse gases meet the definition of air pollutant under the clean air act and ordered the epa to determine whether greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles cause or contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare 
in april  the epa published its proposed endangerment finding for public comment 
the proposed endangerment finding concludes that carbon emissions from mobile sources pose an endangerment to public health and the environment 
the endangerment finding was finalized in december  and is the first step toward epa regulating carbon emissions through the existing clean air act in the absence of specific carbon legislation from congress 
the epa has promulgated two greenhouse gas regulations that apply to the company s generating facilities 
in  the epa finalized a mandatory greenhouse gas emissions registry which requires the reporting of emissions 
the epa has also finalized a revision to the prevention of significant deterioration psd and title v permitting rules which would require facilities that emit  tons or more of greenhouse gases a year to obtain a psd permit for new construction or a significant modification of an existing facility 
the company anticipates additional epa rulemaking related to new generation sources and significant modifications to existing sources  but the timetable remains uncertain 
numerous competing federal legislative proposals have also been introduced in recent years that involve carbon  energy efficiency  and renewable energy 
comprehensive energy legislation at the federal level continues to be debated  but there has been little progress to date 
the progression of regional initiatives throughout the united states has also slowed 
impact of legislative actions other initiatives is unknown if regulations are enacted by the epa or other agencies or if legislation requiring reductions in co and other greenhouse gases or legislation mandating a renewable energy portfolio standard is adopted  such regulation could substantially affect both the costs and operating characteristics of the company s fossil fuel generating plants  nonutility coal mining operations  and natural gas distribution businesses 
at this time and in the absence of final legislation or rulemaking  compliance costs and other effects associated with reductions in greenhouse gas emissions or obtaining renewable energy sources remain uncertain 
the company has gathered preliminary estimates of the costs to control greenhouse gas emissions 
a preliminary investigation demonstrated costs to comply would be significant  first with regard to operating expenses and later for capital expenditures as technology becomes available to control greenhouse gas emissions 
however  these compliance cost estimates are based on highly uncertain assumptions  including allowance prices if a cap and trade approach were employed  and energy efficiency targets 
costs to purchase allowances that cap greenhouse gas emissions or expenditures made to control emissions should be considered a cost of providing electricity  and as such  the company believes such costs and expenditures would be recoverable from customers through senate bill customer rates may also be impacted should decisions be made to reduce the level of sales to municipal and other wholesale customers in order to meet emission targets 
manufactured gas plants in the past  the company operated facilities to manufacture natural gas 
given the availability of natural gas transported by pipelines  these facilities have not been operated for many years 
under current environmental laws and regulations  those that owned or operated these facilities may now be required to take remedial action if certain contaminants are found above the regulatory thresholds at these sites 

table of contents in the indiana gas service territory  the existence  location  and certain general characteristics of gas manufacturing and storage sites have been identified for which the company may have some remedial responsibility 
a remedial investigation feasibility study ri fs was completed at one of the sites under an agreed order between indiana gas and the idem  and a record of decision was issued by the idem in january the remaining sites have been submitted to the idem s voluntary remediation program vrp 
the company has identified its involvement in five manufactured gas plants sites in sigeco s service territory  all of which are currently enrolled in the idem s vrp 
the company is currently conducting some level of remedial activities  including groundwater monitoring at certain sites 
the company has accrued the estimated costs for further investigation  remediation  groundwater monitoring  and related costs for the sites 
while the total costs that may be incurred in connection with addressing these sites cannot be determined at this time  the company has recorded cumulative costs that it reasonably expects to incur totaling approximately million million at indiana gas and million at sigeco 
the estimated accrued costs are limited to the company s share of the remediation efforts and are therefore net of exposures of other potentially responsible parties prp 
with respect to insurance coverage  indiana gas has received approximately million from all known insurance carriers under insurance policies in effect when these plants were in operation 
sigeco filed a declaratory judgment action against its insurance carriers seeking a judgment finding its carriers liable under the policies for coverage of further investigation and any necessary remediation costs that sigeco may accrue under the vrp program and or another site subject to a lawsuit that has been settled 
in november  the court ruled on two motions for summary judgment  finding for sigeco and against certain insurers on indemnification and defense obligations in the policies at issue 
sigeco has settlement agreements with all known insurance carriers and has recorded approximately million of expected insurance recoveries 
the costs the company expects to incur are estimated by management using assumptions based on actual costs incurred  the timing of expected future payments  and inflation factors  among others 
while the company s utilities have recorded all costs which they presently expect to incur in connection with activities at these sites  it is possible that future events may require some level of additional remedial activities which are not presently foreseen and those costs may not be subject to prp or insurance recovery 
as of december  and  respectively  approximately million and million of accrued  but not yet spent  costs are included in other liabilities related to both the indiana gas and sigeco sites 
jacobsville superfund site on july   the epa listed the jacobsville neighborhood soil contamination site in evansville  indiana  on the national priorities list under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla 
the epa has identified four sources of historic lead contamination 
these four sources shut down manufacturing operations years ago 
when drawing up the boundaries for the listing  the epa included a acre block of properties surrounding the jacobsville neighborhood  including the company s operations center 
vectren s property has not been named as a source of the lead contamination 
vectren s own soil testing  completed during the construction of the operations center  did not indicate that the vectren property contains lead contaminated soils above industrial cleanup levels 
at this time  it is anticipated that the epa may request additional soil testing at some future date 
rate regulatory matters vectren south electric base rate filing on december   vectren south filed a request with the iurc to adjust its base electric rates 
the requested increase in base rates addressed capital investments  a modified electric rate design that would facilitate a partnership between vectren south and customers to pursue energy efficiency and conservation  and new energy efficiency programs to complement those currently offered for natural gas customers 
the iurc issued an order in the case on april  the order provides for an approximate million revenue increase to recover costs associated with approximately million in system upgrades that were completed in the three years leading up to the december filing and modest increases in maintenance and operating expenses 
the approved revenue increase is based on rate base of  million  return on equity of percent and an overall rate of return of percent 
the new rates were effective may  the iurc  in its order  denied the company s request for implementation of the decoupled rate design  which is discussed further below 
addressing issues raised in the case concerning coal supply contracts and related costs  the iurc found that current coal contracts remain effective and that a prospective review process of future procurement decisions would be initiated 
coal procurement procedures vectren south submitted a request for proposal in april regarding coal purchases for a four year period beginning in after negotiations with bidders  vectren south has reached an agreement in principle for multi year purchases with two suppliers  one of which is vectren fuels  inc consistent with the iurc direction in the electric rate case  a sub docket proceeding was established to review the company s prospective coal procurement procedures  and the company submitted evidence related to its recent request for proposal rfp and those coal procurement procedures to the iurc in september in october  the oucc filed its testimony which  while suggesting enhancements to the process to be considered  does not challenge the results of the rfp and the resulting new contracts 
all hearings were completed in december and an order is expected in early 
table of contents vectren south electric fuel cost reduction on december  within the quarterly fuel adjustment clause fac filing  vectren south submitted a joint proposal with the oucc to reduce its fuel costs by accelerating the impact of lower cost coal contracts to be effective after in the spring of  vectren secured contracts for lower coal costs through a formal bidding process 
this lower priced coal is expected to start being delivered and used at vectren s power plants by late to early and beyond 
the agreement to accelerate savings into early means that the existing coal costs that are above the new  lower prices will be deferred to a regulatory asset and recovered over a six year period without interest beginning in this deferral also includes a reduction to the coal inventory balance at december  of approximately million to reflect existing inventory at the new  lower price 
the iurc approved this proposal on january   with an impact to customer s rates effective february  vectren south electric demand side management program filing on august   vectren south filed a petition with the iurc  seeking approval of its proposed electric demand side management dsm programs  recovery of the costs associated with these programs  recovery of lost margins as a result of implementing these programs for large customers  and recovery of performance incentives linked with specific measurement criteria on all programs 
the dsm programs proposed are consistent with a december  order issued by the iurc  which  among other actions  defined long term conservation objectives and goals of dsm programs for all indiana electric utilities under a consistent statewide approach 
in order to meet these objectives  the iurc order divided the dsm programs into core and core plus programs 
core programs are joint programs required to be offered by all indiana electric utilities to all customers  and include some for large industrial customers 
core plus programs are those programs not required specifically by the iurc  but defined by each utility to meet the overall energy savings targets defined by the iurc 
on august  the iurc issued an order approving an initial three year dsm plan in the vectren south service territory that complies with the iurc s energy saving targets 
consistent with the company s proposal  the order approved  among other items  the following recovery of costs associated with implementing the dsm plan  the recovery of a performance incentive mechanism based on measured savings related to certain dsm programs  lost margin recovery associated with the implementation of dsm programs for large customers  and deferral of lost margin up to million in associated with small customer dsm programs for subsequent recovery under a tracking mechanism to be proposed by the company 
this mechanism is an alternative to the electric decoupling proposal that was denied by the iurc in the order received april  on january   the company filed with the iurc a proposal for a small customer lost margin recovery mechanism within the existing demand side management adjustment dsma 
the proposal includes a request for recovery of the million deferred in  and a request for continued deferral of lost margins in until such point as these lost margins are included in dsma rates 
the procedural schedule has not been set in this filing  but the company expects an order in vectren south electric dense pack filing on september   vectren south filed a petition with the iurc seeking recovery of and return on the capital investment in dense pack technology to improve the efficiency of its ab brown generating station 
this investment is expected to be approximately million over the next two years  of which approximately million has been invested to date 
this technology is expected to allow the ab brown units to run at least percent more efficient  thereby burning less fuel  and reducing fuel costs and emissions of pollutants 
indiana statute provides for timely recovery of investments  with a return  in instances where the investment increases the efficiency of existing generating plants that are fueled by coal 
several parties have intervened in the case and are requesting that the iurc deny recovery of these project costs outside of a base rate proceeding 
the iurc will conduct a hearing in february vectren north reporting location consolidation proceeding vectren north implemented a reporting location consolidation plan in and closed certain locations throughout the north territory 
on may   the international brotherhood of electrical workers local  united steel workers locals and and others filed a formal complaint with the iurc claiming that the consolidation and simultaneous closing by vectren north of select reporting locations endangers public safety and impairs vectren north s ability to provide adequate  safe and reliable service 
these parties have asked the iurc to require vectren north to reopen previously consolidated reporting locations and maintain and staff those locations 
a hearing in this case was held in february  and the company expects the iurc to act some time in 
table of contents vectren north vectren south gas decoupling extension filing on april   the company s indiana based gas companies vectren north and vectren south filed with the iurc a joint settlement agreement with the oucc on an extension of the offering of conservation programs and the supporting gas decoupling mechanism originally approved in december on august   the iurc issued an order approving the settlement as filed  granting the extension of the current decoupling mechanism in place at both gas companies and recovery of new conservation program costs through december vedo gas rate design the rate design approved by the puco on january   and initially implemented on february   allowed for the phased movement toward a straight fixed variable rate design  which places substantially all of the fixed cost recovery in the monthly customer service charge 
this rate design mitigates most weather risk as well as the effects of declining usage  similar to the company s lost margin recovery mechanism in place in the indiana natural gas service territories and the mechanism in place in ohio prior to this rate order 
since the straight fixed variable rate design was fully implemented in february  nearly percent of the combined residential and commercial base rate gas margins were recovered through the customer service charge 
as a result  some margin previously recovered during the peak delivery winter months  such as january and the first half of february  is more ratably recognized throughout the year 
in addition in  the company began recognizing a return on and of investments made to replace distribution risers and bare steel and cast iron infrastructure per a puco order 
vedo continues the process to exit the merchant function on august   the puco approved the results of an auction selecting qualified wholesale suppliers to provide the gas commodity to the company for resale to its customers at auction determined standard pricing 
this standard pricing was comprised of the monthly nymex settlement price plus a fixed adder 
this standard pricing  which was effective from october  through march   was the initial step in exiting the merchant function in the company s ohio service territory 
the approach eliminated the need for monthly gas cost recovery gcr filings and prospective puco gcr audits 
the second phase of the exit process began on april  during this phase  the company no longer sells natural gas directly to customers 
rather  state certified competitive retail natural gas suppliers  that were successful bidders in a similar regulatory approved auction  sell the gas commodity to specific customers for a month period at auction determined standard pricing 
the first auction was conducted on january   and the auction results were approved by the puco on january  the plan approved by the puco required that the company conduct at least two annual auctions during this phase 
as such  the company conducted another auction on january  in advance of the second month term which commenced on april  the results of that auction were approved by the puco on january  vectren source  the company s former wholly owned nonutility retail gas marketer  was a successful bidder in both auctions winning one tranche of customers in the first auction and two tranches of customers in the second auction 
each tranche of customers equates to approximately  customers 
as per the terms of the plan approved by the puco  because no application for a full exit of the merchant function was neither sought nor approved by april   vedo conducted a third retail auction on january  to address the month term beginning april  the results of that auction were approved by the puco on february  consistent with current practice  customers continue to receive a single bill for the commodity as well as the delivery component of natural gas service from vedo 
the puco provided for an exit transition cost rider  which allows the company to recover costs associated with the transition process 
exiting the merchant function has not had a material impact on earnings or financial condition 
it  however  has and will continue to reduce gas utility revenues and have an equal and offsetting impact to cost of gas sold and revenue related taxes recorded in taxes other than income taxes as vedo no longer purchases gas for resale to these customers 
vedo s gas costs were million  million  and million for the twelve months ended december    and  respectively  while revenue taxes were million  million  and million  respectively 
therefore  gas utility revenues resulting from vedo s exit of the merchant function decreased million in compared to and million in compared to

coal mining  inclusive of holding company costs  earned approximately million  compared to earnings of million in and million in coal mining revenues were million in and represent increases of million compared to and million compared to the increase in revenues reflects increased sales to third parties as a result of opening oaktown in revenues from oaktown more than offset lost revenues from the cypress creek surface mine which closed in with only limited production 
in  the expected higher depreciation and other mining costs as well as higher interest costs associated with the ramp up of mining at the oaktown mine complex more than offset the increase in sales 
coal sold in was million tons  compared to million tons in and million tons in vectren fuels is currently in negotiation with a number of customers regarding sales in and beyond 
vectren fuels and vectren south have adjusted both the price and quantity of coal through the remaining terms of contracts that had price reopener clauses 
pursuant to the supply contracts  vectren fuels expects to supply vectren south  including its plant jointly owned with alcoa  approximately million tons in sales to vectren south are estimated between million and million tons in while both production and sales are expected to increase in  the impact of lower prices is expected to more than offset the higher volumes  and earnings from coal mining operations in are expected to be lower than results in however  changes in market conditions or other circumstances could cause actual results to be materially different from this expectation 
coal reserves as of december  management estimates the company s total illinois basin coal reserves to be approximately million tons 
of this amount  approximately million tons are attributable to a mine located at the company s oaktown mining complex that is currently under construction and is expected to open in the third quarter of however  vectren fuels may continue to adjust this timing as it evaluates the impacts of market conditions

table of contents the million increased loss in and million of the increased loss in which is before the liberty charge reflect the impact on the market of new natural gas sources from shale and greater transmission capacity  as well as the impacts of reduced industrial demand for natural gas in the midwest 
these conditions have resulted in plentiful natural gas supply and lower and less volatile natural gas prices 
historical basis differences between physical and financial markets and summer and winter prices narrowed in as a result  there were reduced opportunities to optimize proliance s firm transportation and storage capacity 
proliance has structured optimization activities to remain flexible to maximize potential opportunities if market conditions improve and as an example has hedged nearly bcf of storage against next winter at higher margins than in various profit improvement initiatives are underway  including efforts to lower the cost of pipeline and storage demand costs through ongoing renegotiations 
through these negotiations and by dropping some uneconomical contracts as they expire  pipeline transportation and storage costs have been lowered to approximately million in  compared to million in in addition to this reduction  additional opportunities exist to renegotiate or drop the remaining contracts  including those with annual demand costs of million that are scheduled to expire through at december   proliance had just over million of members equity on its balance sheet  no long term debt outstanding  and million in seasonal borrowings on its short term credit facility 
depressed market conditions continue  but the demand savings and other actions are expected to reduce proliance s losses in changes in these market conditions or other circumstances could cause actual results to be materially above or below this range

table of contents critical accounting policies management is required to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the related disclosures that conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the consolidated financial statement footnotes describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
certain estimates used in the financial statements are subjective and use variables that require judgment 
these include the estimates to perform goodwill and other asset impairments tests and to determine pension and postretirement benefit obligations 
the company makes other estimates in the course of accounting for unbilled revenue and the effects of regulation that are critical to the company s financial results but that are less likely to be impacted by near term changes 
other estimates that significantly affect the company s results  but are not necessarily critical to operations  include depreciating utility and nonutility plant  valuing reclamation liabilities  and estimating uncollectible accounts and coal reserves  among others 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
impairment review of investments and long lived assets the company has both debt and equity investments in unconsolidated entities 
when events occur that may cause an investment to be impaired  the company performs both a qualitative and quantitative review of that investment and when necessary performs an impairment analysis 
an impairment analysis of notes receivable usually involves the comparison of the investment s estimated free cash flows to the stated terms of the note  or in certain cases for notes that are collateral dependent  a comparison of the collateral s fair value  to the carrying amount of the note 
an impairment analysis of equity investments involves comparison of the investment s estimated fair value to its carrying amount and an assessment of whether any decline in fair value is other than temporary 
fair value is estimated using market comparisons  appraisals  and or discounted cash flow analyses 
property  plant and equipment along with other long lived assets are reviewed as facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired 
this impairment review involves the comparison of an asset s or group of assets carrying value to the estimated future cash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate over a remaining life 
if this evaluation were to conclude that the carrying value is impaired  an impairment charge would be recorded based on the difference between the carrying amount and its fair value less costs to sell for assets to be disposed of by sale 
calculating free cash flows and fair value using the above methods is subjective and requires judgment concerning growth assumptions  longevity of cash flows  and discount rates for fair value calculations  among others 
over the year s presented  the company has recorded charges associated with legacy commercial real estate and other investments using the methods described above and also has reflected its portion of charges taken by equity method investees using these or similar methods 
the million in charges impacting operating results principally reflects recent appraisals and third party offers on similar properties 
should market conditions worsen  additional impairments affecting these and other assets could result and actual realized values could differ from the current carrying values 
goodwill intangible assets the company performs an annual impairment analysis of its goodwill  most of which resides in the gas utility services operating segment  at the beginning of each year  and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred 
impairment tests are performed at the reporting unit level 
the company has determined its gas utility services operating segment as identified in note to the consolidated financial statements to be the level at which impairment is tested as its components are similar 
nonutility group impairment testing for its infrastructure services and energy services segments are also performed at the operating segment level 
an impairment test requires fair value to be estimated 
the company used a discounted cash flow model and other market based information to estimate the fair value of its gas utility services operating segment  and that estimated fair value was compared to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
goodwill related to the nonutility group is also tested using market comparable data  if readily available  or a discounted cash flow model 
the estimated fair value has been in excess of the carrying amount in each of the last three years and therefore resulted in no impairment 

table of contents estimating fair value using a discounted cash flow model is subjective and requires significant judgment in applying a discount rate  growth assumptions  company expense allocations  and longevity of cash flows 
a basis point increase in the discount rate utilized to calculate the gas utility services segment s fair value also would have resulted in no impairment charge 
the company also annually tests non amortizing intangible assets for impairment and amortizing intangible assets are tested on an event and circumstance basis 
during the last three years  these tests yielded no impairment charges 
pension other postretirement obligations the company estimates the expected return on plan assets  discount rate  rate of compensation increase  and future health care costs  among other inputs  and obtains actuarial estimates to assess the future potential liability and funding requirements of the company s pension and postretirement plans 
the company used the following weighted average assumptions to develop periodic benefit cost a discount rate of percent  an expected return on plan assets of percent  a rate of compensation increase of percent  and an inflation assumption of percent 
due to low interest rates  the discount rate is basis points lower from the assumption used in to estimate costs  the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  rate of compensation increase  and inflation assumption were approximately percent  percent  percent  and percent respectively  reflecting the further reductions in interest rates 
management currently estimates a pension and postretirement cost of approximately million in  compared to approximately million in  million in  and million in future changes in health care costs  work force demographics  interest rates  asset values or plan changes could significantly affect the estimated cost of these future benefits 
management estimates that a basis point decrease in the discount rate used to estimate retirement costs generally increases periodic benefit cost by approximately million to million 
unbilled revenues to more closely match revenues and expenses  the company records revenues for all gas and electricity delivered to customers but not billed at the end of the accounting period 
the company uses actual units billed during the month to allocate unbilled units by customer class 
those allocated units are multiplied by rates in effect during the month to calculate unbilled revenue at balance sheet dates 
regulation at each reporting date  the company reviews current regulatory trends in the markets in which it operates 
this review involves judgment and is critical in assessing the recoverability of regulatory assets as well as the ability to continue to account for its activities based on the criteria set forth in fasb guidance related to accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
based on the company s current review  it believes its regulatory assets are probable of recovery 
if all or part of the company s operations cease to meet the criteria  a write off of related regulatory assets and liabilities could be required 
in addition  the company would be required to determine any impairment to the carrying value of its utility plant and other regulated assets and liabilities 
in the unlikely event of a change in the current regulatory environment  such write offs and impairment charges could be significant

these facilities are used to supplement working capital needs and also to fund capital investments and debt redemptions until financed on a long term basis 
liquidity was increased by the million utility holdings debt issuance in february  the net proceeds of which were used to repay short term indebtedness 
both vectren capital s and utility holdings short term credit facilities were renewed in november and are available through september the maximum limit of both facilities remained unchanged 
the company has historically funded the short term borrowing needs of utility holdings operations through the commercial paper market and expects to use the utility holdings short term borrowing facility in instances where the commercial paper market is not efficient

table of contents corporate guarantees the company issues parent level guarantees to certain vendors and customers of its wholly owned subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates 
these guarantees do not represent incremental consolidated obligations  rather  they represent parental guarantees of subsidiary and unconsolidated affiliate obligations in order to allow those subsidiaries and affiliates the flexibility to conduct business without posting other forms of collateral 
at december   parent level guarantees support a maximum of million of esg s performance contracting commitments and warranty obligations and million of other project guarantees 
the broader scope of esg s performance contracting obligations  including those not guaranteed by the parent company  are described below 
in addition  the parent company has approximately million of other guarantees outstanding supporting other consolidated subsidiary operations  of which million represent letters of credit supporting other nonutility operations 
guarantees issued and outstanding on behalf of unconsolidated affiliates approximated million at december  these guarantees relate primarily to arrangements between proliance and various natural gas pipeline operators 
the company has not been called upon to satisfy any obligations pursuant to these parental guarantees and has accrued no significant liabilities related to these guarantees 
as a result of the sale of vectren source on december   the company has million of outstanding guarantees related to this formerly wholly owned subsidiary that will remain in effect for up to days after the closing 
the buyer s parent will hold the company harmless if any amounts are required to be paid pursuant to these guarantees and  within the day period  the buyer is required to provide its own guarantees in substitution for the company guarantees 
performance guarantees product warranties in the normal course of business  wholly owned subsidiaries  including esg  issue performance bonds or other forms of assurance that commit them to timely install infrastructure  operate facilities  pay vendors or subcontractors  and or support warranty obligations 
based on a history of meeting performance obligations and installed products operating effectively  no significant liability or cost has been recognized during the periods presented 
specific to esg  in its role as a general contractor in the performance contracting industry  at december   there are open surety bonds supporting future performance 
the average face amount of these bonds is million  and the largest obligation has a face amount of million 
the maximum exposure of these obligations is less than these amounts for several factors  including the level of work already completed

costs arising from these commitments  while significant  are pass through costs  generally collected dollar for dollar from retail customers through regulator approved cost recovery mechanisms 
because of the pass through nature of these costs  they have not been included in the listing of contractual obligations 
comparison of historical sources uses of liquidity operating cash flow the company s primary source of liquidity to fund working capital requirements has been cash generated from operations  which totaled million in  compared to million in and million in the million increase in operating cash flow in compared to is primarily due to a much greater level of cash utilized from working capital in and increased earnings and non cash charges in these increases were partially offset by a higher level of employer contributions to pension and postretirement plans in in  operating cash flows decreased million compared to this decrease was primarily due to much a greater level of cash generated from working capital in offset by a special dividend from proliance totaling approximately million and higher net income and non cash charges in tax payments in the periods presented were favorably impacted by federal legislation extending bonus depreciation and a change in the tax method for recognizing repair and maintenance activities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to various business risks associated with commodity prices  interest rates  and counter party credit 
these financial exposures are monitored and managed by the company as an integral part of its overall risk management program 
the company s risk management program includes  among other things  the use of derivatives 
the company may also execute derivative contracts in the normal course of operations while buying and selling commodities to be used in operations and optimizing its generation assets 
the company has in place a risk management committee that consists of senior management as well as financial and operational management 
the committee is actively involved in identifying risks as well as reviewing and authorizing risk mitigation strategies 
commodity price risk regulated operations the company s regulated operations have limited exposure to commodity price risk for transactions involving purchases and sales of natural gas  coal and purchased power for the benefit of retail customers due to current state regulations  which subject to compliance with those regulations  allow for recovery of the cost of such purchases through natural gas and fuel cost adjustment mechanisms 
constructive regulatory orders  such as those authorizing lost margin recovery  other innovative rate designs  and recovery of unaccounted for gas and other gas related expenses  also mitigate the effect volatile gas costs may have on the company s financial condition 
although vectren s regulated operations are exposed to limited commodity price risk  volatile natural gas prices have other effects on working capital requirements  interest costs  and some level of price sensitivity in volumes sold or delivered 
wholesale power marketing the company s wholesale power marketing activities undertake strategies to optimize electric generating capacity beyond that needed for native load 
in recent years  the primary strategy involves the sale of excess generation into the miso day ahead and real time markets 
as part of these strategies  the company may also from time to time execute energy contracts that commit the company to purchase and sell electricity in future periods 
commodity price risk results from forward positions that commit the company to deliver electricity 
the company mitigates price risk exposure with planned unutilized generation capability 
the company accounts for any energy contracts that are derivatives at fair value with the offset marked to market through earnings 
no market sensitive derivative positions were outstanding on december  and for retail sales of electricity  the company receives the majority of its nox and so allowances at zero cost through an allocation process 
based on arrangements with regulators  wholesale operations can purchase allowances from retail operations at current market values  the value of which is distributed back to retail customers through a miso cost recovery tracking mechanism 
wholesale operations are therefore at risk for the cost of allowances  which for the recent past have been volatile 
the company manages this risk by purchasing allowances from retail operations as needed and occasionally from other third parties in advance of usage 
in the past  the company also used derivative financial instruments to hedge this risk  but no such derivative instruments were outstanding at december  or 
table of contents other operations other commodity related operations are exposed to commodity price risk associated with natural gas and coal 
other commodity related operations include vectren source  a nonutility retail gas marketer prior to its sale on december   coal mining operations  and the operations at proliance 
open positions in terms of price  volume  and specified delivery points may occur and are managed using methods described below with frequent management reporting 
these subsidiaries  as well as proliance  purchase and sell natural gas and coal to meet customer demands 
forward contracts  and occasionally option contracts  commit them to purchase and sell commodities in the future 
price risk from forward positions is mitigated using stored inventory and offsetting forward purchase contracts 
price risk also results from forward contracts to purchase commodities to fulfill forecasted non regulated sales of natural gas and coal that may or may not occur 
related to coal mining operations  contracts are expected to be settled by physical receipt or delivery of the commodity 
proliance more frequently uses financial instruments that are derivatives to hedge its market exposures that arise from gas in storage  imbalances  and fixed price forward purchase and sale contracts 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk associated with its borrowing arrangements 
its risk management program seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that market volatility may have on interest expense 
the company limits this risk by allowing only an annual average of percent to percent of its total debt to be exposed to variable rate volatility 
however  this targeted range may not always be attained during the seasonal increases in short term borrowings 
to manage this exposure  the company may use derivative financial instruments 
market risk is estimated as the potential impact resulting from fluctuations in interest rates on adjustable rate borrowing arrangements exposed to short term interest rate volatility 
during and  the weighted average combined borrowings under these arrangements approximated million and million  respectively 
at december   combined borrowings under these arrangements were million  which excludes the impact of a million long term debt issuance occurring february as december  combined borrowings under these arrangements were million 
based upon average borrowing rates under these facilities during the years ended december  and  an increase of basis points one percentage point in the rates would have increased interest expense by approximately million in each year 
other risks by using financial instruments to manage risk  the company  as well as proliance  creates exposure to counter party credit risk and market risk 
the company manages exposure to counter party credit risk by entering into contracts with companies that can be reasonably expected to fully perform under the terms of the contract 
counter party credit risk is monitored regularly and positions are adjusted appropriately to manage risk 
further  tools such as netting arrangements and requests for collateral are also used to manage credit risk 
market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a financial instrument that results from a change in commodity prices or interest rates 
the company attempts to manage exposure to market risk associated with commodity contracts and interest rates by establishing parameters and monitoring those parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken 
the company s customer receivables associated with utility operations are primarily derived from residential  commercial  and industrial customers located in indiana and west central ohio 
however  some exposure from nonutility operations extends throughout the united states 
the company manages credit risk associated with its receivables by continually reviewing creditworthiness and requests cash deposits or refunds cash deposits based on that review 
credit risk associated with certain investments is also managed by a review of creditworthiness and receipt of collateral 
in addition  credit risk is mitigated by regulatory orders that allow recovery of all uncollectible accounts expense in ohio and the gas cost portion of uncollectible accounts expense in indiana based on historical experience
