reis s revenue model is based primarily on annual subscriptions that are paid in accordance with contractual billing terms 
reis recognizes revenue from its contracts on a ratable basis  for example  one twelfth of the value of a one year contract is recognized monthly 
discontinued operations residential development activities reis was originally formed on january  reis acquired the reis services business by merger in may  which we refer to as the merger 
prior to may  reis operated as wellsford real properties  inc  which we refer to as wellsford 
wellsford s primary operating activities immediately prior to the merger  and conducted through its subsidiaries  were the development  construction and sale of its three residential projects and its approximate ownership interest in the reis services business 
the company completed the sale of the remaining units at its colorado project in september  sold its claverack  new york project in bulk in february and sold its remaining project in east lyme  connecticut in bulk in april see item legal proceedings 
the company has determined  as a result of the april sale of property in east lyme  connecticut  that the residential development activities segment  including certain general and administrative costs that supported that segment s operations  should be presented as a discontinued operation 
as a result of this determination and the fact that the historic operations and cash flows can be clearly distinguished  the operating results of the residential development activities segment and related general and administrative costs are aggregated for separate presentation apart from continuing operating results of the company in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 

table of contents critical business metrics of the reis services business management considers certain metrics in evaluating the performance of the reis services business 
these metrics are revenue  ebitda which is defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and ebitda margin 
following is a presentation of these historical metrics for the reis services business for a reconciliation of income loss from continuing operations to ebitda and adjusted ebitda for both the reis services segment and on a consolidated basis for each of the periods presented here  see below 
amounts in thousands  excluding percentages for the three months ended december  percentage increase increase revenue ebitda ebitda margin for the three months ended december  september  increase percentage increase revenue ebitda ebitda margin for the years ended december  percentage increase increase revenue ebitda ebitda margin for the years ended percentage december  increase increase decrease decrease revenue ebitda ebitda margin reis services s revenue for both the three months and year ended december  represents the highest quarterly and annual revenue for the business 
reis services s quarterly revenue increased by approximately  or  from the fourth quarter of to the fourth quarter of this revenue increase over the corresponding prior quarterly period is the seventh consecutive quarterly increase in revenue over the prior year s corresponding quarter 
the increase in annual revenue was approximately  or  from the year ended december  the fourth quarter and annual revenue increases reflect positive improvements in overall renewal rates as the trailing twelve month renewal rate improved to at december  as compared to for the trailing twelve months ended december  for institutional subscribers  the renewal rates improved to at december  from at december   additional new business  sales from reisreports  and the cumulative impact of the strength of contract signings in and throughout regarding contract signings  both the fourth quarter and annual periods represent the highest dollar value of contracts booked for a quarter and for a year in the company s history 
revenue increased by approximately  or  from the year ended december  to december  in general  the improving revenue results in the period over the annual period reflect positive improvements in overall renewal rates as the trailing twelve month renewal rate improved to at december  as compared to at december   reduced budgeting constraints by current and prospective subscribers  which during and negatively impacted renewal rates and pricing on subscription contracts entered into at that time  and the cumulative impact of the strength of contract signings beginning in the fourth quarter of and continuing throughout 
table of contents reis s revenue model is based primarily on annual subscriptions that are paid in accordance with contractual billing terms 
reis recognizes revenue from its contracts on a ratable basis  for example  one twelfth of the value of a one year contract is recognized monthly 
therefore  increases in the dollar value of new contracts are spread evenly over the life of a contract  thereby moderating an immediate impact on revenue 
historically  the largest percentage of our contracts are executed in the fourth quarter of each year 
as a result  in times of favorable pricing  larger consecutive quarter revenue growth occurs in the fourth and first quarters 
our contract pricing model is based on actual and projected report consumption  we believe it is generally not as susceptible to economic downturns and personnel reductions at our subscribers as a model based upon individual user licenses 
we typically impose contractual restrictions limiting our immediate exposure during existing contract terms to revenue reductions due to mergers and consolidations 
however  we have been  and we may in the future be impacted by consolidation among our subscribers and potential subscribers  or in the event that subscribers enter bankruptcy or otherwise go out of business 
two additional metrics management utilizes in understanding the business and future performance are deferred revenue and aggregate revenue under contract 
analyzing these amounts can provide additional insight into reis services s financial performance 
deferred revenue  which is a gaap basis accounting concept and is reported by the company on the consolidated balance sheet  represents revenue from annual or longer term contracts for which we have billed and or received payments from our subscribers related to services we will be providing over the remaining contract period 
it does not include future revenue under non cancellable contracts for which we do not yet have the contractual right to bill  this aggregate number we refer to as aggregate revenue under contract 
deferred revenue will be recognized as revenue ratably over the remaining life of a contract 
the following table reconciles deferred revenue to aggregate revenue under contract at december  and  respectively 
percentage december  increase decrease increase decrease deferred revenue gaap basis amounts under non cancellable contracts for which the company does not yet have the contractual right to bill at the period end a aggregate revenue under contract a amounts are billable subsequent to december of each year and represent i non cancellable contracts for subscribers with multi year subscriptions where the future years are not yet billable  or ii subscribers with non cancellable annual subscriptions with interim billing terms 
included in aggregate revenue under contract at december  was approximately  related to amounts under contract for the forward twelve month period through december  the remainder reflects amounts under contract beyond december  the forward twelve month aggregate revenue under contract amount is approximately of revenue on a trailing twelve month basis at december  of approximately  for comparison purposes  at december  and  the forward twelve month aggregate revenue under contract of  and  respectively  as a percentage of that year s revenue was approximately and  respectively 
both deferred revenue and aggregate revenue under contract are influenced by the timing and dollar value of contracts signed  the quantity and timing of contracts that are multiyear  and the impact of recording revenue ratably over the life of a contract  which moderates the effect of price increases after the first year 
these influences resulted in a minor reduction in aggregate revenue under contract and a modest increase in deferred revenue from december  to december  ebitda of reis services for the three months ended december  was  an increase of  or  over the fourth quarter amount 
ebitda of reis services for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or  over the corresponding period 
these increases are directly influenced by the and increases in revenue for the three months and year ended december  over  respectively  as described above  while maintaining ebitda margins for the reis services segment at approximately 
on a consecutive quarter basis  ebitda of reis services increased  or  in the fourth quarter from the third quarter this increase is attributable to  of revenue growth on a consecutive quarter basis  partially offset by increased compensation expense for sales commissions in the fourth quarter which is consistent with the timing of increased contracts in the fourth quarter 
ebitda decreased  from the year ended december  to the year ended december  this is primarily a result of cost increases  primarily in sales and marketing expenses for increases in commissions in over  salary and benefit increases in from hiring for product development and enhancement initiatives  wage increases for existing employees  increased marketing expenses related to our reisreports offering and the continuing increase in the cost of employee benefits  
table of contents primarily for medical insurance 
ebitda for the fourth quarter of modestly improved  over the fourth quarter of  primarily from a revenue increase  in excess of cost increases 
reconciliations of income from continuing operations to ebitda and adjusted ebitda ebitda is defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
adjusted ebitda is defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation 
although ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with gaap  senior management uses ebitda and adjusted ebitda to measure operational and management performance 
management believes that ebitda and adjusted ebitda are appropriate metrics that may be used by investors as supplemental financial measures to be considered in addition to the reported gaap basis financial information to assist investors in evaluating and understanding the performance of the reis services segment  the primary business of the company and the company s continuing consolidated results  from year to year or period to period  as applicable 
further  these measures provide the reader with the ability to understand our operational performance while isolating non cash charges  such as depreciation and amortization expenses  as well as other non operating items  such as interest income  interest expense and income taxes and  in the case of adjusted ebitda  isolates non cash charges for stock based compensation 
management also believes that disclosing ebitda and adjusted ebitda will provide better comparability to other companies in the information services sector 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda are presented both for the reis services business and on a consolidated basis 
we believe that these metrics  for reis services  provide the reader with valuable information for evaluating the financial performance of the core reis services business  excluding public company costs  and to make assessments about the intrinsic value of that stand alone business to a potential acquirer 
management primarily monitors and measures its performance  and is compensated  based on the results of the reis services business 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda  on a consolidated basis  allow the reader to make assessments about the current trading value of the company s common stock  including expenses related to operating as a public company 
however  investors should not consider these measures in isolation or as substitutes for net income  income from continuing operations  operating income  or any other measure for determining operating performance that is calculated in accordance with gaap 
in addition  because ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not calculated in accordance with gaap  they may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies

the income tax expense for the year ended december  of  results from current state and local taxes of  offset by a net current federal alternative minimum tax  or amt  benefit of  income loss from discontinued operations  net of income tax expense  was approximately  and  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the income from discontinued operations primarily reflects the sale of the claverack project in a bulk transaction in february for a gain of  the sale of one home and two lots at east lyme in and the reversal of certain employment related contractual obligations for amounts less than prior period accruals  offset by operating expenses and related general and administrative expenses 
the loss from discontinued operations primarily reflects operating costs of the residential development activities segment and related general and administrative costs in excess of gains from sales of homes or lots at east lyme or condominium units at the gold peak projects 
income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
the net deferred tax asset was approximately  at december   of which  is reflected as a net current asset and  is reflected as a net non current asset in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the net deferred tax liability was approximately  at december  and was reflected as a non current liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the significant portion of the deferred tax items primarily relates to nol carryforwards  federal amt credit carryforwards  and stock based compensation  as they relate to and  liability reserves at december   the tax benefit of impairment charges before allowances at december   all as they relate to deferred tax assets  and the deferred tax liability resulting from the intangible assets recorded at the time of the merger 
the company has aggregate federal  state and local nol carryfowards aggregating approximately  and  at december  and  respectively 
these nols include nols generated subsequent to the merger  losses from private reis prior to the merger  losses obtained from the company s merger with value property trust and the company s operating losses prior to the merger 
at december  and  approximately  of these federal nols are subject to an annual limitation  whereas the remaining balance of approximately  and  respectively  is not subject to such a limitation 
there is an annual limitation on the use of nols after an ownership change  pursuant to section of the internal revenue code 
as a result of the merger  the company experienced such an ownership change which resulted in a new annual limitation of  however  because of the accumulation of annual limitations  it is expected that the use of nols will not be limited by expiration 
a further requirement of the tax rules is that after a corporation experiences an ownership change  it must satisfy the continuity of business enterprise  or cobe  requirement which generally requires that a corporation continue its historic business or use a significant portion of its historic business assets in its business for the two year period beginning on the date of the ownership change to be able to utilize nols generated prior to such ownership change 
the company believes that the cobe requirement was met through the required two year period subsequent to the ownership change  and utilized an aggregate of approximately  of these pre merger nols in its federal tax return filings for and  with appropriate disclosure 
the internal revenue service irs recently completed an audit of the company s federal income tax return 
the tax year included the end of the two year period subsequent to the merger 
the irs issued a no change letter related to the company s tax return  thereby accepting the company s position that the two year cobe requirement was met 
consequently  at december   the company has restored approximately  of nols  the tax benefit of which is approximately  with an equal amount of valuation allowance 
there was no impact to the december  consolidated balance sheet or statements of income as a result of this event 
the company does not have any near term expirations of nols  the next nol expiration is in for approximately  of federal nols 
included in federal and state nols is approximately  attributable to excess tax deductions from the issuance 
table of contents of common shares as non cash compensation 
the tax benefits attributable to those nols will be credited directly to additional paid in capital when utilized to offset taxes payable 
a valuation allowance is required to reduce deferred tax assets if  based on the weight of the evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
accordingly  management has determined that a valuation allowance of approximately  and  at december  and  respectively  was necessary 
the allowance at december  relates primarily to nol carryforwards  amt credits and liability reserves  and at december   relates primarily to nol carryforwards  amt credits and the excess of a portion of the tax basis of certain real estate development assets over their respective financial statement basis 
the decrease in the allowance in is primarily attributable to the release of valuation allowance against deferred assets expected to be utilized in the next three years  as discussed above  of  a reduction in the effective tax rate utilized by the company approximately  and utilizing the tax loss on the sale of the company s east lyme project for which an allowance was provided for  related to the net liability in  offset by the allowance provided for the net litigation liability at december  as part of its assessment to reduce a portion of the valuation allowance and reflect deferred tax assets on the consolidated balance sheet at december   management considered many factors  including the completion of sales in of assets in its residential development activities segment  the trend of pre tax income from both continuing operations and income before taxes  on a consolidated basis without consideration of discontinued operations reporting  and the predictability of future pre tax income for the next three years 
based upon these factors  and consideration of uncertainties that could affect the ultimate usability of the deferred tax assets  management has concluded to record an aggregate deferred tax asset of  at december  in order to be able to realize the deferred tax assets in the future  the company considered its historic trend in revenue and ebitda growth rates  the expected level of future amortization and depreciation expense and the expectation that there should be minimal financial impact from the discontinued operations 
if revenue and ebitda growth is not achieved to the extent expected  or at all  if ebitda margins materially decline  or if material losses occur as a result of litigation from any of our former development projects  the ability to fully utilize these assets in the next three years  could be affected 
there is no expectation of future taxable income being derived from a source other than ordinary and recurring operations of the company s business to be able to utilize deferred tax assets 
management was unable to conclude that all of its deferred tax assets would be realized  and therefore has maintained a valuation allowance of approximately  at december  the company will continue to evaluate the amount of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets during and subsequent years based on such factors as historic profitability levels and forecasts of future taxable income 
the company s reserve for unrecognized tax benefits  including estimated interest and penalties  was approximately  at december  and the reserve reductions in primarily resulted from the resolution of unrecognized tax benefits and the related estimate for interest and penalties  offset by interest accruals on other unrecognized items 
interest and penalties related to these tax provisions were included in general and administrative expenses and included a benefit of  in  for the resolution of related unrecognized tax benefits in  and an expense of  in no additional expense was recorded in liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents aggregated approximately  at december   including approximately  in the reis services segment 
management considers such amounts to be adequate and expects its cash balances to continue to be adequate to meet operating  product development and enhancement initiatives and debt service requirements in both the short and long terms  at both the reis services segment and on a consolidated basis 
at december   the company  on a consolidated basis and at the reis services segment level  was net cash positive defined as cash and cash equivalents  minus total debt by approximately  and  respectively 
at december   the company  on a consolidated basis and at the reis services segment level  was net cash positive by approximately  and  respectively 
net cash on a consolidated basis and at the reis services level grew by approximately  and  respectively  from december  to december   which management believes is a strong indicator of the cash generation power of the reis services business model 
at december   the company s short term liquidity requirements include current operating and capitalizable costs  near term product development and enhancement of the web site and databases  the current portion of long term debt solely comprised of scheduled principal payments of approximately  on the bank loan  which will be paid in full by its september  maturity date  operating leases  remaining warranty costs  insurance deductibles and settlements or judgments related to real estate construction from our discontinued operations  other costs  including public company expenses not included in the reis services segment  repurchases of shares of reis common stock of which approximately  remained available at december  pursuant to the august board authorization  the potential settlement of certain outstanding stock options in cash the liability for which was approximately  at december  based upon the closing stock price of the company at december  
table of contents of per share  and the payment of employee taxes on vested options  for which the employee used shares to settle his her minimum withholding tax obligations with the company 
the company expects to meet these short term liquidity requirements generally through the use of available cash and cash generated from subscription revenue of reis services 
the company expects that in the short term  it will be able to utilize its nols and that taxes to be paid will be for alternative state and local taxes  and possibly amt  but not for federal income taxes 
if  in connection with the construction defect litigation at our gold peak development project as more fully described in item legal proceedings  it is determined that an amount materially in excess of our estimated net reserve of  at december  aggregate minimum exposure of  net of minimum expected insurance recovery of  is required as a result of settlement or judgment  the company could  among other alternatives  utilize its available cash and would consider if additional borrowing or bonding is required to satisfy such cash settlement or judgment 
although not factored into the company s assessment of this case for purposes of reserves  in the event of an adverse judgment  the company would expect to appeal  and would continue to pursue all available remedies against applicable insurers or other parties at fault 
the company s long term liquidity requirements include future operating and capitalizable costs  long term product development and enhancements of the web sites and databases  operating leases and other capital expenditures  remaining warranty costs and insurance deductibles related to real estate construction from our discontinued operations  other costs  including public company expenses not included in the reis services segment  and repurchases of additional shares of reis common stock 
the company expects to meet these long term liquidity requirements generally through the use of available cash and cash generated from subscription revenue of reis services 
the company has nols that it expects to be able to use beyond the next few years against future federal  state and local taxable income  if any 
tax payments during the next few years are expected to be for alternative state and local taxes and amt  but not for federal income taxes

awards granted under the company s incentive plans expire ten years from the date of grant and vest over periods ranging generally from three to five years for employees 
certain outstanding options allow the option holder to receive from the company  in cancellation of the holder s option  a cash payment with respect to each cancelled option equal to the amount  if any  by which the fair market value of the share of stock underlying the option exceeds the exercise price of such option 
the company accounts for these options as liability awards

comparison of cash flows for the years ended december  and cash flows provided by operating activities decreased  from  provided in the period to  provided in the period 
the decrease in cash flows from operating activities is a function of increased uses of cash in the period related to accrued expenses due to the timing of payments and settlement of employment and other contractual obligations previously accrued for and a decrease in real estate sales between the two periods

selected significant accounting policies management has identified the following accounting policies which it believes are significant in understanding the company s activities  financial position and operating results 
basis of presentation the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its majority owned and controlled subsidiaries 
investments in entities where the company does not have a controlling interest are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
these investments were initially recorded at cost and were subsequently adjusted for the company s proportionate share of the investment s income loss and additional contributions or distributions 
all significant inter company accounts and transactions among the company and its subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation 
discontinued operations the company has determined  as a result of the april sale of property in east lyme  connecticut  that the residential development activities segment  including certain general and administrative costs that supported that segment s operations  should be presented as a discontinued operation 
as a result of this determination and the fact that the historic operations and cash flows can be clearly distinguished  the operating results of the residential development activities segment and related general and administrative costs are aggregated for separate presentation apart from continuing operating results of the company in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
intangible assets  amortization and impairment web site development costs the company expenses all internet web site costs incurred during the preliminary project stage 
thereafter  all direct external and internal development and implementation costs are capitalized and amortized using the straight line method over their remaining estimated useful lives  not exceeding three years 
the value ascribed to the web site intangible asset acquired at the time of the merger was amortized on a straight line basis over three years  and during  this ascribed value was fully amortized 
amortization of all capitalized web site development costs is charged to product development expense 
database costs the company capitalizes costs for the development of its database in connection with the identification and addition of new real estate properties and sale transactions which provide a future economic benefit 
amortization is calculated on a straight line basis over a three or five year period 
costs of updating and maintaining information on existing properties in the database are expensed as incurred 
the value ascribed to the database intangible asset acquired at the time of the merger is amortized on a straight line basis over three or five years  and during  this ascribed value which had a three year amortizable life was fully amortized 
amortization of all capitalized database costs is charged to cost of sales 
customer relationships the value ascribed to customer relationships acquired at the time of the merger is amortized over years on an accelerated basis and is charged to sales and marketing expense 
lease value the value ascribed to the below market terms of the office lease existing at the time of the merger is amortized over the remaining term of the acquired office lease which was approximately nine years 
amortization is charged to general and administrative expenses 

table of contents goodwill and intangible asset impairment goodwill and a major portion of the other intangible assets were recorded at the time of the merger 
as a result of the tax treatment of the merger  goodwill and the acquired intangible assets are not deductible for income tax purposes 
goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment at least annually  or after a triggering event has occurred  requiring such a calculation 
a qualitative assessment can be utilized to determine if a more detailed two step calculation is required 
if the qualitative assessment results in a determination that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  including goodwill  then no further evaluation would be necessary 
if  after performing the qualitative assessment  the company determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  including goodwill  then the first step of the two step test would be necessary 
the first step is based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned with the reporting unit s carrying value 
the fair values used in this evaluation are estimated based upon market projections for the reporting unit 
these market projections utilize a number of estimates and assumptions  such as ebitda multiples  market comparisons  and quoted market prices 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill is not deemed to be impaired 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  a second step is required to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit 
there was no goodwill impairment identified in  or the company early adopted the qualitative assessment guidance for goodwill in  which did not impact the consolidated financial statements  other than disclosure 
intagible assets  with determinable useful lives  are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives using a method of amortization that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise used up 
in addition  the carrying amount of amortizable intangible assets are reviewed when indicators of impairment are present 
if estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  the asset would be considered impaired 
an impairment charge would be determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value  with any shortfall from fair value recognized as an expense in the current period 
there was no intangible asset impairment identified in  or revenue recognition and related items the company s subscription revenue is derived principally from subscriptions to its web based services for its reis se product and is recognized as revenue ratably over the related contractual period  which is typically one year but can be as long as months 
revenues from ad hoc and custom reports or projects are recognized as completed and delivered to the customers  provided that no significant company obligations remain 
revenues from the reisreports product are recognized monthly as billed 
deferred revenue represents the portion of a subscription billed or collected in advance under the terms of the respective contract  which will be recognized in future periods 
if a customer does not meet the payment obligations of a contract  any related accounts receivable and deferred revenue are written off at that time and the net amount  after considering any recovery of accounts receivable  is charged to cost of sales 
cost of sales of subscription revenue principally consists of salaries and related expenses for the company s researchers who collect and analyze the commercial real estate data that is the basis for the company s information services 
additionally  cost of sales includes the amortization of database technology 
revenue from sales of real estate  including condominium units  single family homes and sales of lots individually or in bulk were recognized at closing subject to receipt of down payments and other requirements in accordance with applicable accounting guidelines 
the percentage of completion method was not used for recording sales on condominium units as downpayments were nominal and collectability of the sales price from such a deposit was not reasonably assured until closing 
interest revenue is recorded on an accrual basis 
income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities  and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are estimated to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances with respect to deferred income tax assets are recorded when deemed appropriate and adjusted based upon periodic evaluations 
the company evaluates its tax positions in accordance with applicable current accounting literature 
recognition of uncertain tax positions step one occurs when an enterprise concludes that a tax position  based solely on its technical merits  is more likely than 
table of contents not to be sustained upon examination 
measurement step two determines the amount of benefit that more likely than not will be realized upon settlement 
derecognition of a tax position that was previously recognized would occur when a company subsequently determines that a tax position no longer meets the more likely than not threshold of being sustained or there is a satisfactory resolution of the tax position 
share based compensation the fair market value as of the grant date of awards of stock  restricted stock units or certain stock options is recognized as compensation expense by the company over the respective vesting periods 
the company estimated the fair value of each option granted on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the following table includes the assumptions that were made and the estimated fair value for option grants in no option awards were granted during or grant stock price on grant date exercise price dividend yield risk free interest rate expected life years estimated volatility fair value of options granted per option although the initial fair value of stock options is not adjusted after the grant date  changes in the company s assumptions may change the value of  and therefore the expense related to  future stock option grants 
the assumptions that cause the greatest variation in fair value are the expected volatility and expected life of the option 
increases or decreases in either the expected volatility or expected life of the option will cause the fair value to increase or decrease  respectively 
the volatility assumption of approximately considers both historical and implied volatility and may be impacted by the company s performance as well as changes in economic and market conditions 
the expected life of years for the options was determined based upon historical exercise patterns and a probability weighted exercise analysis 
if the estimated volatility used by the company during was increased to and the expected life used by the company during was increased to years  the fair value of the options would have increased to per option  or 
if the estimated volatility used by the company during was decreased to and the expected life used by the company during was decreased to years  the fair value of the options would have decreased to per option  or 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure has been to changes in interest rates 
this risk may be managed by limiting the company s financing exposures  to the extent possible  by purchasing interest rate caps when deemed appropriate 
at december  and  the company s only exposure to interest rates was variable rate based debt 
this exposure has historically been minimized through the use of interest rate caps 
the interest rate cap on the bank loan expired at june  the following tables present the effect of a increase in the applicable base rates of variable rate debt at december  and  respectively amounts in thousands balance at december  libor at december  additional interest incurred variable rate debt bank loan  a balance at december  libor at december  additional interest incurred variable rate debt bank loan  a a reflects additional interest which could be incurred annually on the loan balance amount as a result of a increase in libor 
it does not take into consideration future periodic repayments 

table of contents although the interest rate cap expired at june   our interest rate exposure on the bank loan has been limited and will continue to diminish significantly as a result of increased scheduled principal repayments during through its maturity at september  management is assessing the need  if any  for replacement financing upon full repayment of the bank loan 
reis holds cash and cash equivalents at various regional and national banking institutions 
management monitors the institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents 
management s emphasis is primarily on safety of principal 
management  in its discretion  has diversified reis s cash and cash equivalents among banking institutions to potentially minimize exposure to any one of these entities 
to date  we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our invested cash or cash equivalents  however  we can provide no assurances that access to invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 
cash balances held at banking institutions with which we do business may exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits 
while management monitors the cash balances in these bank accounts  such cash balances could be impacted if the underlying banks fail or could be subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets
