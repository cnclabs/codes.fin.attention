critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and include the accounts of asure s wholly owned subsidiaries 
all significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in the consolidation 
preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates are subjective in nature and involve judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at fiscal year end and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the fiscal year 
the more significant estimates made by management include the valuation allowance for the gross deferred tax asset  contingency legal reserves  lease impairment  useful lives of fixed assets  the determination of the fair value of its long lived assets  and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed during the iemployee acquisition 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the given circumstances 
these estimates could be materially different under different conditions and assumptions 
additionally  the actual amounts could differ from the estimates made 
management periodically evaluates estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements for continued reasonableness 
appropriate adjustments  if any  to the estimates used are made prospectively based upon such periodic evaluation 
management believes the following represent asure s critical accounting policies revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable 
the company recognizes software revenue in accordance with fasb asc  revenue recognition fasb asc 
the company s revenues consists of software license  software subscription and service fees 
revenue from the software element is earned through the licensing or right to use the company s software and from the sale of specific software products 
service fee income is earned through the sale of maintenance and technical support  training and installation 
revenue from the sale of hardware devices is recognized upon shipment of the hardware 
asure also sells multiple elements within a single sale 

table of contents since the company currently offers software both as a perpetual license and as software as a service  revenue recognition varies based on which of these forms of software the customer purchases 
when the company sells software licenses in a multiple element arrangement and vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value is available for the undelivered element  sales revenue is generally recognized on the date the product is shipped  using the residual method  with a portion of revenue recorded as deferred unearned due to the applicable undelivered elements 
vsoe of fair value for the maintenance  training and installation services are based on the prices charged for the maintenance and services when sold separately 
undelivered elements for our multiple element arrangements with a customer are generally restricted to post contract support  training and install 
the amount of revenue allocated to these undelivered elements is based on the vsoe of fair value for those undelivered elements 
deferred revenue due to undelivered elements is recognized ratably on a straight line basis over the service period typically one year or when the service is completed 
when vsoe of fair value is not available for the undelivered element of a multiple element arrangement  sales revenue is generally recognized ratably  on a straight line basis over the service period of the undelivered element 
the company s training and installation services are not essential to the functionality of the company s products as such services can be provided by a third party or the customers themselves 
the company also sells software subscriptions and may at times sell related setup  implementation and professional services in the same arrangement 
setup and implementation services typically occur at start of the software subscription period  while certain professional services may not occur until several months later depending on the nature of the services and the customer requirements 
prior to january   the company recognized the total contract value of software subscriptions and related services ratably as a single unit of accounting over the contract term  beginning when the customer was able to utilize the software 
subsequent to the adoption of the updated fasb asc  the company accounts each of these elements as separate accounting units 
the company allocates the value of the arrangement to each unit of accounting based on vendor specific objective evidence of selling price  when it exists  third party evidence of selling prices for like services or estimated selling price 
software subscription service revenues are recognized pro rata over the life of the software subscription contract  while the related setup  implementation or professional services revenues are recognized upon completion 
the result of the adoption is an immaterial acceleration of setup  implementation and professional service revenues related to software subscription transactions the company does not recognize revenue for agreements with rights of return  refundable fees  cancellation rights or acceptance clauses until such rights of return  refund or cancellation have expired or acceptance has occurred 
the company s arrangements with resellers do not allow for any rights of return 
deferred revenue includes amounts received from customers in excess of revenue recognized  and is comprised of deferred maintenance  service and other revenue 
deferred revenues are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations when the service is completed and over the terms of the arrangements  primarily ranging from one to three years 
intangible assets and goodwill the company records the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition  with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill 
valuation of intangible assets and in process research and development entails significant estimates and assumptions including  but not limited to  estimating future cash flows from product sales  developing appropriate discount rates  estimating probability rates for the continuation of customer relationships and renewal of customer contracts  and approximating the useful lives of the intangible assets acquired us gaap requires that intangible assets other than goodwill with an indefinite life should not be amortized until their life is determined to be finite  and all other intangible assets must be amortized over their useful lives 
the company is currently amortizing its acquired intangible assets with definite lives over periods ranging from one to nine years 
impairment of intangible assets and long lived assets in accordance with fasb asc  asure reviews and evaluates its long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their net book value may not be recoverable 
when such factors and circumstances exist  including those noted above  the company compares the assets carrying amounts against the estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated by those assets over their estimated useful lives 
if the carrying amounts are greater than the undiscounted cash flows  the fair values of those assets are estimated by discounting the projected cash flows 
any excess of the carrying amounts over the fair values are recorded as impairments in that fiscal period 

table of contents on may   the company and ceridian corporation ceridian  a reseller of the company s iemployee products  entered into an agreement by which joint customers of the company and ceridian were given until july  to choose either to i contract directly with the company to continue using our goods and services  or ii continue using ceridian s offerings that may not include the company s products and services 
depending on the number of customers that contracted with asure and the related pricing  the cash flows associated with the ceridian customers may vary from historical levels 
thus the company tested the ceridian customer relationships intangible asset for impairment in accordance with fasb asc the company compared the asset s carrying amount against the estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the customers that contracted with asure over the estimated useful life of the intangible asset 
the undiscounted cash flows from the intangible asset exceeded the carrying value of the intangible asset and thus no impairment was required 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb updated fasb asc  revenue recognition fasb asc to address how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting and how the arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting 
this guidance eliminates the residual method and replaces it with the relative selling price method when allocating revenue in a multiple deliverable arrangement 
the selling price for each deliverable shall be determined using vendor specific objective evidence of selling price  if it exists  otherwise third party evidence of selling price shall be used 
if neither exists for a deliverable  the vendor shall use its best estimate of the selling price for that deliverable 
after adoption  this guidance will also require expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures 
the updated fasb asc is effective for the company s revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
the company adopted the updated fasb asc on january  on a prospective basis for any new contracts entered into after the date of adoption 
the adoptions of this asc update did not have a material impact to its condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three and nine months ended september  and however  the company cannot predict whether the impact of this update will have a material impact in future quarters due to potential changes in products and product mix 
prior to the adoption of the updated fasb asc  the company accounted for its software subscriptions and related setup  implementation and professional services as a single accounting unit 
thus all revenues associated with such an arrangement were recognized pro rata over the life of the software subscription service contract 
subsequent to the adoption of the updated fasb asc  the company accounts for each of these elements as separate accounting units 
thus the software subscription service revenue is recognized pro rata over the life of the software subscription contract  while the related setup and implementation revenues are recognized upon completion 
the result of the adoption is an immaterial acceleration of setup and implementation revenues related to software subscriptions
