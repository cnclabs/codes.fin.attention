item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a clinical stage drug development company that discovers and develops novel  small molecule drugs for the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases  as well as muscle disorders 
our pioneering research focuses on intracellular signaling pathways and related targets that are critical to disease mechanisms 
our productivity has resulted in strategic collaborations with large pharmaceutical partners to develop and market our product candidates 
current product development programs include fostamatinib  an oral syk inhibitor that is in phase clinical trials for ra partnered with az  r  an inhaled syk inhibitor that has completed phase clinical trials for asthma  r  an oral jak inhibitor in phase clinical trials for the treatment of transplant rejection and other immune disorders  and r  a topical jak syk inhibitor in phase clinical trials for the treatment of discoid lupus lupus of the skin 
since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  contract payments under our collaboration agreements and equipment financing arrangements 
our research and development activities  including preclinical studies and clinical trials  consume substantial amounts of capital 
in june  we completed an underwritten public offering in which we sold  shares of our common stock pursuant to an effective registration statement at a price to the public of per share 
we received net proceeds of approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities 
we believe that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to support our current and projected funding requirements through at least the next months 
unless and until we are able to generate a sufficient amount of product  royalty or milestone revenue  we expect to finance future cash needs through public and or private offerings of equity securities  debt financings or collaboration and licensing arrangements  as well as through interest income earned on the investment of our cash balances and short term investments 
with the exception of contingent and royalty payments that we may receive under our existing collaborations  we do not currently have any commitments for future funding 
product development programs our product development portfolio features multiple novel  small molecule drug candidates whose specialized mechanisms of action are intended to provide therapeutic benefit for a range of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders  as well as muscle disorders

research and development expenses our research and development expenditures include costs related to preclinical and clinical trials  scientific personnel  supplies  equipment  consultants  sponsored research  stock based compensation  and allocated facility costs 
we do not track fully burdened research and development costs separately for each of our drug candidates 
we review our research and development expense by focusing on three categories research  development  and other 
our research team is focused on creating a portfolio of product candidates 
table of contents that can be developed into small molecule therapeutics in our own proprietary programs or with potential collaborative partners and utilizes our robust discovery engine to rapidly discover and validate new product candidates in our focused range of therapeutic indications 
research expenses relate primarily to personnel expenses  lab supplies  fees to third party research consultants and compounds 
our development group leads the implementation of our clinical and regulatory strategies and prioritizes disease indications in which our compounds may be studied in clinical trials 
development expenses relate primarily to clinical trials  personnel expenses  lab supplies and fees to third party research consultants 
other expenses primarily consist of allocated facilities costs and allocated stock based compensation expense relating to personnel in research and development groups 
in addition to reviewing the three categories of research and development expense described in the preceding paragraph  we principally consider qualitative factors in making decisions regarding our research and development programs  which include enrollment in clinical trials and the results thereof  the clinical and commercial potential for our drug candidates and competitive dynamics 
we also make our research and development decisions in the context of our overall business strategy  which includes the evaluation of potential collaborations for the development of our drug candidates 
the following table presents our total research and development expense by category 
years ended december  in thousands categories research development other other expenses mainly represent allocated facilities costs of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  and allocated stock based compensation expenses of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
for the period from january  to december   our total research and development expense by category was million  million  and million  for research  development and other  respectively 
for the year ended december   a major portion of our total research and development expense was associated with our allocated facilities costs  the salaries of our research and development personnel  allocated stock based compensation expense and research and development expense for our asthma program  as well as our oral jak inhibitor program 
for the year ended december   the major portion of our total research and development expense was related to the extension trials in ra patients and the oral jak inhibitor program 
for the years ended december   the major portion of our total research and development expense was associated with our two phase b clinical trials taski and taski  as well as the related extension trials in ra patients 
the phase clinical trials of fostamatinib in ra were completed in we licensed the rights to fostamatinib to az in february on september   az announced the enrollment of the first patient in the phase clinical program for fostamatinib  referred to as oskira az also announced that in the first quarter of they had commenced a phase b clinical trial  oskira  that explores fostamatinib as a monotherapy in ra 
recently  az indicated that the phase studies in ra are continuing as planned 
oskira completed full enrollment in the fourth quarter of az expects to file a nda for fostamatinib in the united states and a european equivalent in the second 
table of contents half of az will be responsible for conducting and funding all future development  regulatory filings  manufacturing and global commercialization of products containing most of our oral syk inhibitors 
the scope and magnitude of future research and development expense are difficult to predict given the number of clinical trials that we will need to conduct for any of our potential products  as well as our limited capital resources 
preclinical testing and clinical development are long  expensive and uncertain processes 
in general  biopharmaceutical development involves a series of steps  beginning with identification of a potential target and including  among others  proof of concept in animals and phase  and clinical trials in humans 
each of these steps is typically more expensive than the previous step 
success in early stages of development often results in increasing expenditures for a given product candidate 
significant delays in clinical testing could materially impact our product development costs and timing of completion of the clinical trials 
we do not know whether planned clinical trials will begin on time  will need to be halted or revamped or will be completed on schedule  or at all 
clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons  including delays in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial  delays from scale up  delays in reaching agreement on acceptable clinical trial agreement terms with prospective clinical sites  delays in obtaining institutional review board approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective clinical site or delays in recruiting subjects to participate in a clinical study 
we currently do not have reliable estimates of total costs for a particular drug candidate to reach the market 
our potential products are subject to a lengthy and uncertain regulatory process that may involve unanticipated additional clinical trials and may not result in receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals 
failure to receive the necessary regulatory approvals would prevent us from commercializing the product candidates affected 
in addition  clinical trials of our potential products may fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy  which could prevent or significantly delay regulatory approval 
we do not have a reasonable basis to determine when or if material net cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of our drug candidates will occur 
commercialization of our product candidates depends upon successful completion of extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy for humans 
we do not know whether we  or any of our current or potential future collaborative partners  will undertake clinical trials of potential products beyond the trials already concluded and the trials currently in process 
it will take us  or our current or potential future collaborative partners  several years to complete any such testing  and failure can occur at any stage of testing 
interim results of trials do not necessarily predict final results  and acceptable results in early trials may not be repeated in later trials 
moreover  we or our current or potential future collaborative partners may decide to discontinue development of any project at any time for regulatory  commercial  scientific or other reasons 
to date  we have not commercialized any of our drug candidates  and we may never do so 
for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the timing and costs of completing the development of our drug candidates  see part i 
item a 
risk factors  including in particular the following risks if our corporate collaborations or license agreements are unsuccessful  our research and development efforts could be delayed 
if conflicts arise between our collaborators or advisors and us  any of them may act in their self interest  which may be adverse to our stockholders interests 
if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval to market products in the united states and foreign jurisdictions  we will not be permitted to commercialize products from our research and development 

table of contents we might not be able to commercialize our product candidates successfully if problems arise in the clinical testing and approval process 
there is a high risk that drug discovery and development efforts might not successfully generate good product candidates 
we will need additional capital in the future to sufficiently fund our operations and research 
because we expect to be dependent upon collaborative and license agreements  we might not meet our strategic objectives 
delays in clinical testing could result in increased costs to us 
for further discussion on research and development activities  see research and development expense under results of operations below 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the terms of our research and development collaborations ie revenue recognition of upfront fees and certain contingent payments  investments  stock based compensation  impairment issues  the estimated useful life of assets  and estimated accruals and contingencies  on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that there were no significant changes in our critical accounting policies during the year ended december  as compared to those previously disclosed in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition we present revenue from our collaboration arrangements under financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  collaboration arrangements 
our revenue arrangements with multiple elements are evaluated under fasb asc  multiple element arrangements as amended by accounting standards update asu  and are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has standalone value to the customer  whether the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered element and whether delivery or performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially under our control 
following the adoption of asu on january   consideration we receive under collaboration arrangements is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on the selling price hierarchy  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria is applied to each of the separate units 
advance payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue until earned 
revenues related to collaborative research with our corporate collaborators are recognized as research services are performed over the related development periods for each agreement 
under these agreements  we are required to perform research and development activities as specified in each respective agreement 
the payments received are not refundable and are generally based on a contractual cost per full time equivalent employee working on the project 
our research and 
table of contents development expenses under the collaborative research agreements approximate the revenue recognized under such agreements over the term of the respective agreements 
it is our policy to recognize revenue based on our level of effort expended  however  revenue recognized will not exceed amounts billable under the agreement 
revenues associated with substantive  at risk milestones pursuant to collaborative agreements are recognized upon achievement of the milestones 
we consider a milestone to be substantive at the inception of the arrangement if it is commensurate with either our performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone  it relates solely to past performance and it is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement 
non refundable contingent future amounts receivable in connection with future events specified in collaboration agreements that are not considered milestones will be recognized as revenue when payments are earned from our collaborators through completion of any underlying performance obligations  the amounts are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
stock based compensation total stock based compensation expense related to stock based awards to our officers  directors and all other employees and consultants under our stock option plans that we recognized for the years ended december   and was comprised as follows aggregate change aggregate change years ended december  from from in thousands stock based compensation expense from officer  director and employee options consultant options restructuring charges total we grant options to purchase our common stock to our officers  directors and all other employees and consultants under our stock option plans 
eligible employees can also purchase shares of our common stock at a price per share equal to the lesser of of the fair market value on the first day of the offering period or of the fair market value on the purchase date under our employee stock purchase plan purchase plan 
the benefits provided under these plans are stock based payments subject to the provisions of fasb asc we adopted the use of the straight line attribution method over the requisite service period for the entire award 
in addition  we estimate the amount of expected forfeitures when calculating compensation costs  then record actual forfeitures as they occur 
we review our forfeiture rates each quarter and make any necessary changes to our estimates 
the decrease in stock based compensation expense for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  was primarily due to the amortization of stock based compensation expense in the first quarter of related to options granted in late march of that vested over one year  in addition to the amortization of stock based compensation expense related to options granted in january of that vested over one year  while amortization of stock based compensation expense for the year ended december  primarily relates to options granted in that vested over one year 
the increase in stock based compensation expense for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  was primarily due to the stock based compensation expense amortization resulting from the increase in the number of options granted in  as compared to the same period in  as well as additional amortization of stock based 
table of contents compensation expense in the first quarter of related to options granted in late march of  which were fully amortized by the end of the first quarter of in february  we announced that we cut our research programs in virology and oncology as well as terminated certain related development and administrative staff  which resulted in the dismissal of employees  or approximately of our workforce 
this measure was intended to maintain our emphasis on our active preclinical and clinical programs  while conserving our resources 
as part of a package we offered the terminated employees  we extended the date the terminated employees had to exercise their vested options to december  rather than days from the termination date as is typically required under our equity incentive plan 
we recorded  of non cash stock based compensation expense incurred in connection with this modification in the first quarter of the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model is affected by our stock price  as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  volatility  expected term  risk free interest rate and dividends 
we estimate volatility over the expected term of the option using historical share price performance 
for expected term  among other things  we take into consideration our historical data of options exercised  cancelled and expired 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury constant maturity rate 
we have not paid and do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
in order to calculate stock based compensation expense  we also estimate the forfeiture rate using our historical experience with options that cancel before they vest 
we also record charges associated with options granted to consultants reflecting the fair value and periodic fair value re measurement of outstanding consultant options under fasb asc the valuation is based upon the current market value of our common stock and other assumptions  including the expected future volatility of our stock price  risk free interest rate and expected term 
we amortize stock based compensation related to consultants using a straight line attribution method consistent with the method used for employees and with the attribution election we made upon adoption of fasb asc research and development accruals we have various contracts with third parties related to our research and development activities 
costs that are incurred but not billed to us as of the end of the period are accrued 
we make estimates of the amounts incurred in each period based on the information available to us and our knowledge of the nature of the contractual activities generating such costs 
clinical trial contract expenses are accrued based on units of activity reported by third parties 
expenses related to other research and development contracts  such as research contracts  toxicology study contracts and manufacturing contracts are estimated to be incurred generally on a straight line basis over the duration of the contracts 
raw materials and study materials purchased by third parties are expensed at the time of purchase 
many of our estimates are based significantly or in part on information provided for us by third parties 
if such information were not reported properly  our research and development expense amounts could be misstated

liquidity and capital resources cash requirements from inception  we have financed our operations primarily through sales of equity securities  contract payments under our collaboration agreements and equipment financing arrangements 
we have consumed substantial amounts of capital to date as we continue our research and development activities  including preclinical studies and clinical trials 
in february  we entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with az for the global development and commercialization of our oral syk inhibitors for the treatment of human diseases other than those primarily involving respiratory or pulmonary dysfunction 
az is responsible for conducting and funding all future development  regulatory filings  manufacturing and global commercialization of products containing most of our oral syk inhibitors 
the agreement became effective on march  and  in connection with the effectiveness of the agreement  we received an upfront payment from az of million in april in october  we received million from az for completing the transfer of the fostamatinib long term open label extension study to az and for the initiation of phase clinical 
table of contents studies in the fostamatinib program by az 
az is required to pay us up to an additional million if specified development  regulatory and launch events are achieved for fostamatinib 
we are also eligible to receive up to an additional million if specified sales levels are achieved for fostamatinib  as well as significant stepped double digit royalties on net worldwide sales  if any 
future events that could trigger payments to us under the az agreement are based solely on az s future efforts and achievements of milestones 
in june  we completed an underwritten public offering in which we sold  shares of our common stock pursuant to an effective registration statement at a price to the public of per share 
we received net proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities  as compared to approximately million as of december   an increase of approximately million 
the increase was primarily attributable to net proceeds of approximately million from our public offering in the second quarter of  partially offset by operating expenses for the year ended december   as well as payments of certain capital expenditures 
we believe that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to support our current and projected funding requirements through at least the next months 
we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong  and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of our product candidates and other research and development activities  including risks and uncertainties that could impact the rate of progress of our development activities  we are unable to estimate with certainty the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical trials and other research and development activities 
our operations will require significant additional funding for the foreseeable future 
unless and until we are able to generate a sufficient amount of product  royalty or milestone revenue  we expect to finance future cash needs through public and or private offerings of equity securities  debt financings or collaboration and licensing arrangements  as well as through interest income earned on the investment of our cash balances and short term investments 
with the exception of contingent and royalty payments that we may receive under our existing collaborations  we do not currently have any commitments for future funding 
to the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our stockholders could at that time experience substantial dilution 
any debt financing that we are able to obtain may involve operating covenants that restrict our business 
to the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements  we may be required to relinquish some of our rights to our technologies or product candidates  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
our future funding requirements will depend upon many factors  including  but not limited to the progress and success of clinical trials and preclinical activities including studies and manufacture of materials of our product candidates conducted by our collaborative partners or licensees or us  the ability to achieve the events identified in our collaborative agreements that trigger payments to us from our collaboration partners  the progress of research programs carried out by us  any changes in the breadth of our research and development programs  the progress of the research and development efforts of our collaborative partners  our ability to acquire or license other technologies or compounds that we seek to pursue  
table of contents our ability to manage our growth  competing technological and market developments  the costs and timing of obtaining  enforcing and defending our patent and other intellectual property rights  the costs and timing of regulatory approvals and filings by us and our collaborators  and expenses associated with the pending and potential additional related purported securities class action lawsuits  as well as any unforeseen litigation 
insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research or development programs  to lose rights under existing licenses or to relinquish greater or all rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose or may adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern 
for the year ended december  and  we maintained an investment portfolio primarily in money market funds  us treasury bills  government sponsored enterprise securities  and corporate bonds and commercial paper 
cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested with regard to liquidity and capital preservation 
wherever possible  we seek to minimize the potential effects of concentration and degrees of risk 
recently  the credit rating for the us long term sovereign debt was downgraded by s p 
given the short duration of our investment portfolio  we believe that such downgrade did not materially affect the value of our investments 
we have evaluated our investment strategy and decided not to change it at this time 
there is no assurance that further deterioration in the conditions of the credit and financial markets would not negatively impact our current investment portfolio 
we will continue to monitor the impact in the downgrade of the credit rating and the disruptions in the financial markets to our investment portfolio and if future changes in our investment strategy are necessary

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities in which we invest may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the market value amount of our investment will decline 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and available for sale securities in a variety of securities  including money market funds and government and non government debt securities 
in  and  we maintained an investment portfolio primarily in money market funds  u 
s 
treasury bills  government sponsored 
table of contents enterprise securities  and corporate bonds and commercial paper 
due to the primarily short term nature of these investments  we believe we do not have a material exposure to interest rate risk and market risk arising from our investments
