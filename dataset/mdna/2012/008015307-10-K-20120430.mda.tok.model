explanatory note management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition md a is provided to help provide an understanding of our business  financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report 
our md a is organized as follows overview 
this section contains trend analysis  a summary of the challenges we encountered this fiscal year and steps we are taking to address these challenges 
this section may contain forward looking statements 
these statements are based on our current expectations and actual results may materially differ from such expectations 
among the factors that could cause actual results to vary are those described in this overview section and in item a 
risk factors 
results of operations 
this section provides an analysis of results of operations for the two fiscal years presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes 
liquidity and capital resources 
this section provides an analysis of cash flows  a discussion of outstanding debt  working capital and capital expenditures  and commitments  both firm and contingent  that existed as of january   and trends  demands  events and uncertainties with respect to our ability to finance our continuing operations 
critical accounting policies 
this section discusses the accounting policies i that require us to make estimates that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  ii for which a different estimate which could have been made would have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  iii that are the most important and pervasive policies utilized  and iv that are the most sensitive to material change from external factors 
overview we design and manufacture aircraft instrumentation and sensor systems 
these products are used for both primary flight data and for standby purposes in cockpits that use electronic displays for primary flight data 
as cockpit panel space becomes more valuable in the new age of glass displays  we have maintained a strong position with original equipment manufacturers oems as a premier supplier of quality aircraft instrumentation in both the military and commercial aircraft marketplace 
this allows us to offer a fully integrated avionics package  from air data collection products to display and backup instrumentation and allows our aircraft manufacturer customers to reduce their number of suppliers 
our unique capabilities in air data collection products continue to expand with the development of multiple air data system designs for domestic and international customers  including highly advanced contour flushport systems as well as new variants of our legacy probe designs 
these technologies support manned aircraft and the expanding unmanned autonomous vehicle uav markets 
during fiscal year  we were awarded development contracts to modify or extend air data capabilities for products on existing airframes using these technologies 
building on our expertise with mechanical instrumentation  we have successfully developed and marketed digital instrumentation and displays for both primary flight data systems as well as standby redundant systems to complement our mechanical product line 
our current market focus has been  and will continue to be  the design  development and supply of electronic and mechanical primary and standby flight control systems components and instruments 
these include altimeters  airspeed indicators  angle of attack indicators  stall warning systems  air data measurement systems and flight display systems 
these products are critical to aircraft operation  performance and safety 
in conjunction with our development and production activities  we have developed expertise in the building  testing and validation of critical test equipment  including environmental stress screening chambers and wind tunnels 
we are expanding that knowledge to offer customers the ability to order turnkey solutions for their test needs 
the trend in the aerospace industry continues toward digital cockpits and away from mechanical cockpit instrumentation that was our foundation 
during fiscal year  we continued to make progress in our ability to design and manufacture digital instrumentation that is integrated into cockpit flight management systems 
we maintained and strengthened our commitment to research and development to further enhance our product line as we anticipate continued movement toward digital cockpits in the aerospace industry 
our new oasis multi function standby display is being promoted in support of this trend 
we plan to position ourselves such that we continue to offer both digital and mechanical instrumentation solutions to our customers 
while we believe that this strategy will  over time  strengthen our position in the aerospace industry  we cannot guarantee that this strategy will be successful or that we will have access to the capital resources needed to fully support this strategy 
a significant amount of our business relates to the sale of our products to us and foreign military programs 
as a consequence  our sales can fluctuate materially  either favorably or unfavorably  depending upon the level of government spending on those military programs which are a major focus of our manufacturing efforts 
while we have been successful in obtaining contracts to supply military needs in recent years  sudden reductions in government spending or delays in the government contract award process could have a material unfavorable effect on our current and future military sales and related cash flows 
while we cannot predict the outcome of the us government contract award or budget process  we expect that the majority of the military programs that we supply will be sustained at current or near current levels 
additionally  us government procurement offices often require long periods of time to issue requests for proposals and to negotiate contracts 
such lengthy contract cycle times may delay the award of certain anticipated contracts of significant value to the company 
delays of significant contract awards may have an adverse effect on the financial results of the company 
similarly  changes in the commercial sector of the aerospace industry can have a favorable or unfavorable impact on our future business 
while we have historically invested heavily in product development for both funded and unfunded programs  oem requirements may change such that additional product development efforts will be necessary to maintain or increase our revenue in the aerospace industry 
with respect to ongoing contracts  several of our commercial customers continue to operate with reduced operations and manufacturing 
while this may be offset by additional increases in aftermarket support  it is likely that our business will continue to be negatively affected until the economy recovers and our customers resume prior levels of production and growth 
recently  we are finding that with the negative effects of the ongoing recession  the general aviation and business jet markets are taking longer to recover than previously expected 
continued reductions of customer deliveries may have a significant adverse effect on our financial results 
recognizing the risks and challenges of the current environment in both our military and commercial markets  we continue to closely analyze our operations and our cost structure for opportunities to enhance our financial performance in the face of a difficult economic environment 
we will continue to evaluate our operations and implement actions we deem appropriate to counter the near term challenges in our markets while preserving our ability to be responsive to our customers as the economy improves 
results of operations our senior management regularly reviews the performance of our operations including reviews of key performance metrics and the status of operating initiatives 
we review information on the financial performance of the operations  new business opportunities  customer relationships and initiatives  independent research and development ir d activities  human resources  manufacturing effectiveness  cost reduction activities  as well as other subjects 
we compare performance against budget  against prior comparable periods and against our most recent internal forecasts 
we believe overall prospects for our financial performance to be very good over the long term  while we continue to work our way through short term challenges 
during fiscal year  we received new orders totaling million  not including options  which were million  or  greater than fiscal year these orders increased our backlog of firm orders to nearly million as of january   a increase over the backlog of million as of january  these orders are expected to be delivered over the next three years and include products and services for both domestic and international programs 
however  our financial performance in fiscal year was adversely affected by the slower economy generally  and in the aerospace industry in particular  resulting in reduced sales of certain products 
in addition  the move of our repair station from virginia to florida also impacted earnings  an investment that we expect will improve customer service and reduce overall operating costs 
the virginia property held for sale and the virginia leased property continue to use cash for maintenance and debt servicing without contributing significantly to our operations  thereby adversely affecting our results of operations 
our ability to enhance gross profit and operating results will require that we introduce new products and grow our business while continuing to improve manufacturing throughput and delivery performance 
we are well engaged in implementing lean manufacturing principles  supported by training programs  to further develop a consistent  disciplined  and innovative engineering and production culture 
we complement these initiatives with a marketing and sales strategy that builds on our market presence and core competencies in sensor  air data computation  and display technologies 
we believe that our recent and planned future investments in support of our customers will produce strong returns as our markets continue their recovery 
because of our greatly improved operating metrics  as well as direct customer feedback with respect to quality and delivery performance  we are far better positioned to win new business 
we believe that our improved systems  focused value stream teams  and growing capabilities will enable us to far more reliably fulfill commitments to our customers  suppliers  and shareholders 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year net sales were  during fiscal year  a decrease of  compared to  for fiscal year during fiscal year  our sales volume decreased from the prior year by approximately million on reduced demand for mechanical instruments and sensor products  offset by approximately million of increased sales of new development products and services  while the sales of spares and repairs were comparable year to year 
gross profit for fiscal year was compared to for fiscal year the decrease in gross profit in fiscal year  as a percent of sales  reflects a the completion of two customer funded development contracts  including additional current year losses  b contract loss provisions on one customer funded development contract  c increased costs associated with lean investment activities  including process development  documentation  and training  and d costs associated with the transition of the virginia repair station to our florida facility 
management views these costs as investments in technology and capabilities that are expected to benefit future business opportunities 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a for fiscal year decreased  or  compared to fiscal year the net decrease was primarily due to a lower ir d costs and b lower business development expenses 
interest expense  net decreased to  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year  primarily due to lower interest expense and accretion expense relating to the investors notes payable 
gains from casualty of  in fiscal year relate to the insurance claim from our august  fire 
we reported a loss on extinguishment of debt in fiscal year in the amount of  representing accelerated accretion expense relating to the portion of the notes payables repaid early versus  reported in fiscal year representing a accelerated accretion expense relating to the portion of the notes payables repaid early and b costs relating to the extinguishment of debt with our prior bank 
income before taxes was  in fiscal year  down  from income before taxes of  in fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to lower gross profit and the gain from casualty loss reported in fiscal  offset by reduced selling  general and administrative costs and lower interest costs  as explained above 
income tax expense was  in fiscal year compared to income tax expense of  for fiscal year the effective tax rate of in fiscal year is higher than the effective tax rate of in fiscal year due primarily to permanent differences remaining relatively constant while income levels were lower in fiscal year than the prior year 
for fiscal year  our net income was approximately  or basic and diluted income per share  compared to net income of approximately  or basic and diluted income per share for the year ended january  the lower income per share amounts were driven by lower income before taxes combined with the higher effective tax rate  as explained above 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of capital have been cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit facility  described below 
as of january   we had approximately  in cash and cash equivalents  compared to approximately  as of january  in addition  as of january  and  we had  and  respectively  available under the credit facility 
our cash provided by operating activities was  for fiscal year  an increase in cash provided of  compared to cash provided of  for fiscal year this net increase in cash provided by operating activities is primarily attributable to increases in cash provided by operating activities of  as presented in decreased prepaid expenses and other current assets due to the release of deferred charges related to completed engineering contracts in fiscal year compared to the continued deferral of engineering contract charges in fiscal year   from slower customer payments which increased accounts receivable at january  when compared to january   however  less than the increase in accounts receivable at january  when compared to january    from decreased inventory at january  when compared to inventory levels at january  and  from eliminated repayments of customer advances in fiscal year  compared to repayments of customer advances in fiscal year primarily offset by increases in cash used in operating activities of  as presented in decreased accrued expenses and other liabilities due primarily to the release of  in contract loss provisions related to completed engineering contracts in fiscal year compared to no releases of contract loss provisions in fiscal year  due primarily to the provision and write off of obsolete inventory in fiscal year   from reduced accretion of long term debt in fiscal year when compared to accretion expense in fiscal year and  from decreased operating net income in fiscal year when compared to operating net income in fiscal year our cash used in investing activities increased  in fiscal year when compared to fiscal year due primarily to increased additions of  in capital improvements and equipment during fiscal year compared to additions of  of capital improvements and equipment during fiscal year our cash used in financing activities for fiscal year was  when compared to cash provided by financing activities in fiscal year of  we note a change of  the change was attributable to  of net pay down of our credit facility  as well as an additional  net pay off of the investors notes payable described below 
offsetting the cash used in financing activities was cash provided by financing activities of  due to additional draw downs on our line of credit 
our days sales in accounts receivable increased to days at january   up from days at january   due in large part to our customers lengthening their payment cycles 
through cash management and purchasing practices  our outstanding balances with production suppliers declined as days purchases in accounts payable decreased to days at january   down from days at january  however  we continue to be challenged to maintain favorable payment terms with certain suppliers 
our liquidity will depend on our ability to achieve budgeted operating results and to refinance or renew our revolving credit line note when it matures on june  sufficient liquidity is necessary to  among other things  i satisfy working capital requirements  ii fulfill necessary capital spending  and iii meet our debt obligations in fiscal year and beyond 
although our fiscal year cash flows from operations improved over the prior year  we continue to experience liquidity challenges because of our reduced earnings  increased demand for capital additions and debt repayment during fiscal year when compared to fiscal year our failure to improve our operating results could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and could require the implementation of curative measures  including raising capital  deferring planned capital expenditures and research and development efforts  reductions in force  reducing discretionary spending  and selling assets 
there can be no assurance that our proposed plans and actions will be successful or that unforeseen circumstances will not require us to seek additional funding sources in the future or effectuate additional plans to conserve liquidity 
in addition  there can be no assurance that in the event additional sources of funds are needed  they will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
bmo harris bank credit facility we are party to a loan agreement the loan agreement with bmo harris bank with a maximum amount of credit facilities the credit facility available to us of  the loan agreement provides for a a  revolving line of credit  pursuant to a revolving line of credit note in the original principal amount of up to  the revolving credit line note  b a  first real estate mortgage loan  c a  term loan and d a  equipment line of credit 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the credit facility contains certain financial and other restrictive covenants  including the requirement to maintain i minimum total stockholders equity  ii a ratio of funded debt to ebitda  and iii a fixed charge coverage ratio 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
for the period measured as of january   we were in compliance with all covenants in the credit facility 
on april   bmo harris bank waived the company s january  non compliance with the funded debt to editda covenant in the credit facility 
on april   pursuant to a joint amendment to loan agreement and revolving line of credit note  bmo harris bank amended the credit facility s funded debt to ebitda covenant to for the balance of fiscal year as a result  on april   the company was in compliance with the funded debt to ebitda covenant under the bmo harris bank credit facility 
additionally  on that date  bmo harris bank extended the maturity date of the revolving credit line note to june  on june   bmo harris bank amended the revolving credit line note by extending the maturity date to june  and amended the interest rate applicable to the revolving credit line note to one month libor plus basis points  which eliminated the prior requirement of a floor 
also  on that date  bmo harris bank amended the interest rate calculation method within the loan agreement which requires the use of a day calculation method 
this method applies the ratio of the applicable interest rate over a year of days  multiplied by the outstanding principal balance of the revolving credit line note and then multiplied by the actual number of days the principal balance is outstanding 
this calculation method results in a higher effective interest rate than the numeric interest rate stated in the revolving credit line note 
for the period measured as of july   the company did not comply with the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant in the credit facility 
on september   bmo harris bank waived the company s july  non compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant in the credit facility 
for the period measured as of october   the company did not comply with the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant in the credit facility 
on december   bmo harris bank waived the company s october  non compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant in the credit facility 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
on september   the company entered into an amendment the amendment to the loan agreement 
the amendment temporarily increased the limit under the revolving credit line note from  to  for a ninety day period commencing on september  and ending on december  to evidence this credit increase  the company simultaneously replaced the revolving credit line note through issuance of a new revolving line of credit note in the initial principal amount of  the amended and restated revolving credit line note 
except as amended to reflect the increased original principal amount and temporarily increased credit limit  the amended and restated revolving credit line note contains the same terms and conditions as the revolving credit line note  which are described in more detail below 
the amended and restated revolving credit line note matures on june  and provides a line of credit in an amount equal to the lesser of a the revolving credit limit of i  until december  and ii  from december  until the maturity date  or b a borrowing base determined based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
interest is payable monthly 
the interest rate applicable to the amended and restated revolving credit line note is one month libor plus basis points 
the interest rate calculation method requires the use of a day calculation method which applies the ratio of the applicable interest rate over a year of days  multiplied by the outstanding principal balance of the amended and restated revolving credit line note and then multiplied by the actual number of days the principal balance is outstanding 
this calculation method results in a higher effective interest rate than the numeric interest rate stated in the amended and restated revolving credit line note 
we were in compliance with all covenants within the credit facility as of january  investors notes payable on may   we entered into separate unsecured loans the notes payable with three separate private investors collectively  the investors bruce j 
stone  redmond family investments  lllp and martin l 
schaffel 
each note payable contained a drawdown provision allowing us to borrow up to an aggregate of  documentation for the notes payable provided for issuance of warrants with an exercise price of per warrant issued at the rate of one warrant for every four dollars loaned to us and common shares at the rate of one share for every ten dollars loaned to us 
additionally  any amounts borrowed are subject to interest per annum  payable monthly 
on may   we borrowed an aggregate principal amount of  under the notes payable 
this transaction resulted in issuance of  warrants to the investors that are exercisable until the warrants expire on april   as well as  common shares 
this aggregate amount borrowed of  was initially payable in full under each of the three notes on or before april  on february   we borrowed an additional  from the investors under the notes payable and entered into amendments to the notes payable 
these modifications a extended the maturity date of the subordinated notes for a period of one year from april  to april   b removed our obligation to issue shares of our common stock on each cash drawdown made on or after february   c revised the ratio of common shares underlying warrants issuable per each of principal amount borrowed from 
shares per of principal amount to 
shares per of principal amount with respect to cash drawdowns made on or after february   and d deleted certain negative covenants relating to the issuance of securities 
the warrant modifications a extended the expiration date of any warrants issued prior to february  for a period of five years from april  to april   b extended the expiration date of any warrants issued on or after february  from april  to the sixth anniversary date of the issuance of the warrant certificate  and c revised the purchase price for any warrants issued on or after february  from per share to a price equal to of the volume weighted average of the selling price of our common stock on february  and for the trading days prior to february   or per share 
the related warrants  issued to the investors pursuant to the additional  loan are exercisable at any time before the warrants expire on february  the warrants and common shares issued under the notes payable are recorded as a separate component of interest and are being accreted into the loan balances over the term of the loans 
for the fiscal years ended and  we recognized accretion of  and  respectively  presented as additional interest expense 
in addition  as a result of early repayments to the investors during fiscal years and  we recognized accelerated interest accretion expense in the amount of  and  respectively  which is reported as loss on extinguishment of debt 
on march   we completed repayment of the notes payable in full satisfaction of the remaining debt outstanding of  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
working capital and capital expenditures our working capital at january  was  compared to  at january  this decrease in working capital of  as of january  relates  in part  to an increase in the balance under our revolving line of credit of  a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of  due primarily to released deferred charges on completed engineering contracts and a decrease in inventory of  due primarily to the write off of obsolete inventory 
these unfavorable changes to working capital are offset  in part  by favorable changes to working capital associated with an increase in accounts receivable of  the pay down of current maturities of long term debt of  and a decrease in accrued liabilities of  due primarily to the release of contract loss provisions related to completed engineering contracts 
the collection of our accounts receivable is the primary source of cash used to fund our operations 
our banking line of credit is used as an additional source of cash as necessary from time to time  and we sweep any excess cash back against the line of credit on a daily basis to minimize interest expense 
we believe that cash collected from our accounts receivable  as further supplemented by advances under our credit facility  are adequate to fund our ongoing operations for the next twelve months 
prior to the maturity date of the amended and restated revolving credit line note on june   we intend on refinancing or renewing our credit facility with bmo harris bank 
however  there can be no assurance that we will achieve our expected operating results and or have access to and or renew or refinance our credit facility  or that unforeseen circumstances will not require us to seek additional funding sources in the future 
in addition  there can be no assurance that in the event additional sources of funds are needed  they will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
our future capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including research and development  expansion of product lines and other factors 
furthermore  we may need to develop and introduce new or enhanced products  respond to competitive pressures  invest or acquire businesses or technologies or respond to unanticipated requirements or developments  which would require additional resources 
currently  our cash flow from operations alone may not be sufficient to meet these challenges 
our capital expenditures for fiscal year were  compared to  for fiscal year historically  our capital budget was intended to replace fixed asset equipment as needed and to take advantage of technological improvements that would improve productivity 
we replaced certain critical fixtures  environmental test chambers and testing equipment that we lost in the august  fire during fiscal years and additionally  we renovated and reconfigured our florida production facility in those years to accommodate equipment previously located in our building destroyed in the fire 
inflation and changing prices our profitability is dependent  among other things  on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the cost of key operating resources  including labor and raw materials 
substantial increases in cost of sales and expenses could impact our operating results to the extent that such increases cannot be passed along to customers 
while we are taking steps to mitigate our risk to rising prices with prudent purchasing practices and improving our inventory management techniques  there can be no assurance that future supplies of raw materials and labor will not fluctuate due to market conditions outside of our control 
certain operating costs such as taxes  insurance and other outside services continue to increase at or above the general rate of inflation  and we may be subject to other cost and supply fluctuations outside of our control 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of january  contractual obligations the following table presents estimated cash requirements for contractual obligations outstanding as of january  payments due by period less than one year to greater than one year years years to years after years total purchase commitments   long term debt   revolving credit facility  operating leases   total contractual obligations   environmental matters in preparation for the sale of the earlysville  virginia facility  we engaged an environmental consulting firm to survey the property for possible soil or groundwater contamination 
this survey revealed impacts to both shallow soils and groundwater that may have resulted from the accidental loss of solvents 
as a result of the initial and subsequent surveys  contamination treatment was determined to be necessary at an estimated total cost of  as of january   as determined by an environmental compliance specialist  and which is included in the environmental liability 
thus  we capitalized these contamination treatment costs in our financial statements as an increase to property held for sale  net  since such costs will be incurred in preparation for the sale of the earlysville  virginia facility 
we have had discussions with the former owner of the property concerning responsibility for contamination treatment 
we joined the former owner of the property in soliciting proposals in from environmental consulting firms and received a proposal from which management estimates the cost of contamination treatment to be approximately  depending on the findings of additional studies  the scope and cost of the contamination treatment may change 
current estimates of future monitoring  oversight and other related costs are estimated between approximately  and  as of january   we and the former owner of the property were negotiating the terms of administrative consent orders with the us environmental protection agency for completion of the contamination characterization and treatment plans 
we continue to be in communication with the former owner of the property concerning its responsibility to cover the costs of the contamination characterization and treatment 
we will reassess the accrued liability and record any appropriate adjustments in our financial statements following completion of the characterization process as required by these orders 
costs incurred during the fiscal year ended january  and january  to pay an environmental consulting firm to characterize contamination that may be present in the ground between the our property and nearby homes amounted to  and  respectively 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the accompanying consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of those consolidated financial statements and this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure items  including disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  at the date of our consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and as a result of trends and uncertainties identified above under results of operations and liquidity and capital resources and in item a 
risk factors 
further  such differences could be material 
set forth below is a discussion of our critical accounting policies 
we consider critical accounting policies to be those i that require us to make estimates that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  ii for which a different estimate which could have been made would have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  iii that are the most important and pervasive policies utilized  and iv that are the most sensitive to material change from external factors 
additionally  the policies discussed below are critical to an understanding of the consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimates about the effect of matters that are highly uncertain 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on business operations is discussed throughout this md a where such policies affect reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion regarding the application of these and other accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates and the related disclosure included herein with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition the company generally recognizes revenue from sales of its products when the following have occurred evidence of a sale arrangement exists  delivery or shipment has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
for fixed price contracts  the company may recognize revenue on a multiple elements arrangement basis 
the multiple elements arrangement method requires the company to evaluate all deliverables in an arrangement to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting 
the company makes that determination at the inception of the arrangement 
in an arrangement with multiple deliverables  the delivered item s shall be considered a separate unit of accounting if a the delivered item s have value to the customer on a standalone basis  b there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item s and c the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item s and delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor 
the company may also recognize its revenue under the completed contract method 
for long term  fixed price contracts meeting certain criteria  the company may elect to follow the percentage of completion method of accounting for revenue recognition 
under this method  contract revenue is computed as that percentage of estimated total revenue that costs incurred to date bear to total estimated costs  after giving effect to the most recent estimates of costs to complete 
from time to time  the company will record costs and estimated profits in excess of billings for a contract 
revisions in costs and revenue estimates are reflected in the period in which the revisions are determined 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined without regard to the percentage of completion 
periodically  the company enters into research and development contracts with customers 
when the contracts provide for milestone or other interim payments  the company will recognize revenue either under the milestone method or the multiple elements arrangement method 
the milestone method requires the company to deem all milestone payments within each contract as either substantive or non substantive 
that conclusion is determined based upon a thorough review of each contract and the company s deliverables committed to in each contract 
for substantive milestones  the company concludes that upon achievement of each milestone  the amount of the corresponding defined payment is commensurate with the effort required to achieve such milestone or the value of the delivered item 
the payment associated with each milestone relates solely to past performance and is deemed reasonable upon consideration of the deliverables and the payment terms within the contract 
for non substantive milestones  including advance payments  the recognition of such payments are pro rated to the substantive milestones 
milestones may include  for example  the successful completion of design review or technical review  the submission and acceptance of technical drawings  delivery of hardware  software  spares  test equipment or regulatory agency certifications 
accounts receivable  allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses we continuously evaluate our customers and provide reserves for anticipated credit losses as soon as collection becomes compromised 
while credit losses have historically been within expectations of the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that have been experienced in the past 
measurement of such losses requires consideration of historical loss experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data  including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates and financial health of specific customers 
inventories the company values inventory at standard cost which generally reflects the most recent significant cost for manufactured or purchased inventory 
standards are revalued from time to time to reflect the lower of cost using a method that approximates the first in  first out method fifo or net realizable value 
the reserve for obsolete and slow moving inventory is based upon reviews of inventory quantities on hand  usage and sales history 
work in process inventories we employ certain methods to estimate the value of work in process inventories for financial reporting purposes 
our practice has been to conduct cycle counts of inventory throughout the year 
generally  for items that are in process at the end of a fiscal year  we will make an estimate during the cycle counting process regarding the percentage of completion of such items in order to accurately reflect costs incurred to date on the production of the items that are still in process 
these estimates are affected by the nature of the operation at which the items are located at the time a physical inventory is conducted  and are subject to judgment 
this practice was employed for fiscal years and manufacturing overhead cost application we establish our inventoriable cost of manufacturing overhead by calculating our overhead costs as a percentage of direct labor and applying that percentage to direct labor that has been charged to inventory on a twelve month rolling average basis 
this application percentage is reviewed and adjusted annually 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance we account for income taxes in accordance with us gaap  which states that deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided against the future benefit of deferred tax assets to the extent it is determined that it is more likely than not that the future tax benefits associated with the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
property held for sale property held for sale is reported at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
depreciation on property held for sale is discontinued at the time the criteria  established by us gaap  are met 
the earlysville  virginia property is presently held for sale 
the property consists of a  square foot manufacturing facility on approximately acres of land 
in preparation for the sale of the earlysville  virginia facility  we engaged an environmental consulting firm to survey the property for any possible soil or groundwater contamination 
this survey revealed impacts to both shallow soils and groundwater that may have resulted from the accidental loss of solvents by a former owner of the property 
as a result of the initial and subsequent surveys  the remaining contamination treatment costs are estimated at  as of january  we have capitalized these contamination treatment costs as an increase to property held for sale  net  since such costs will be incurred in preparation for the sale of the earlysville  virginia facility and will not result in a carrying value in excess of the estimated fair value less cost to sell 
costs incurred during fiscal year totaled  and costs incurred during the fiscal year ended january  totaled  at this time  we cannot predict how much  if any  we will incur for more costs in fiscal year goodwill and intangible assets the carrying value of goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment and will be reviewed more frequently if current events and circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
an impairment loss is charged to expense in the period identified 
as current events and circumstances warrant  the company examines the carrying value of its intangible assets with finite lives  such as capitalized software and development costs  purchased intangibles  and other long lived assets  to determine whether there are any impairment losses 
if indicators of impairment are present and future cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the asset s carrying amount  an impairment loss is charged to expense in the period identified 
factors that may cause impairment include negative industry or economic trends or significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results 
long lived assets the useful lives of property  plant and equipment for purposes of computing depreciation are land improvements years buildings and improvements years machinery and equipment years patterns  dies  and tools years furniture and fixtures years we periodically evaluate long lived assets for potential impairment and will record an impairment charge whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
as of january  and january   we do not believe that any assets are impaired 
we will capitalize production costs for computer software that is to be utilized as an integral part of a product when both a technological feasibility is established for the software  and b all research and development activities for the other components of the product have been completed 
amortization is charged to expense at the greater of the expected unit sales versus units sold or the straight line method for a period of three years from the date the product becomes available for general release to customers 
income taxes the company and its includable subsidiaries file a consolidated us federal income tax return in accordance with the provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
the company s accounting for income taxes represents management s best estimate of various events and transactions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities are measured at the balance sheet date using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
the realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods under the tax law in the applicable tax jurisdiction 
valuation allowances are established when management determines  based on available information  that it is more likely than not that deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
significant judgment is required in determining whether valuation allowances should be established as well as the amount of such allowances 
when making such determination  consideration is given to  among other things  the following future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards  future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  taxable income in prior carryback years and tax planning strategies 
we believe that we will ultimately recover a majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets 
however  should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely 
we re evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a regular basis 
this evaluation is based on factors such as changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  new audit activity  and effectively settled issues 
determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires judgment 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 
the company classifies tax related interest and tax related penalties as a component of income taxes 
research and development research and development costs that are not associated with specific customer contract requirements are expensed in the period incurred and are included in selling  general and administration expenses 
environmental expenditures the company assesses its property held for sale  along with any property that is being taken out of its initially intended use  for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances that would result in an environmental liability 
in addition  management assesses its current property in use for any environmental issues 
liabilities for environmental remediation costs not related to retirements of tangible long lived assets  and arising from claims  assessments  litigation  fines  and penalties and other sources  are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment and or remediation can be reasonably estimated 
legal costs incurred in connection with environmental remediation are expensed as incurred 
recoveries of environmental remediation costs from third parties  which are probable of realization  are separately recorded as assets  and are not offset against the related environmental liability  in accordance with us gaap 
stock based compensation the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of us gaap using the modified prospective transition method which requires us to recognize compensation expense on a prospective basis 
us gaap requires that all stock based compensation be recognized as an expense in the financial statements and that such cost be measured at the fair value of the award 
under this method  in addition to reflecting compensation for new share based awards  expense is also recognized to reflect the remaining service period of awards that had been included in pro forma disclosure in prior periods 
the stock based compensation expense is included in selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
during the fiscal years ended january  and january   the company recorded stock based compensation of  and  respectively 
stock issued in payment for services provided by members of the board of directors is expensed in the period the services are provided 
during both fiscal years ended january  and  the company recorded director fees expense  through the issuance of stock  of product warranties we provide for the estimated costs of warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized 
we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates and historical and projected repair costs 
warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the customer it was sold to  but generally includes parts and labor over a period generally ranging from one to five years 
we regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary 
use of estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap 
these principles require management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported and contingent amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  including such items as i inventory  restructuring and environmental costs  ii percentage of completion estimates  iii other miscellaneous accruals and iv valuation allowances for accounts receivable  inventory and deferred tax assets 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and such differences could be material 
adoption of new accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended the guidance on the annual testing of goodwill for impairment 
the amended guidance will allow us to assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test required under current accounting standards 
this guidance will be effective for our fiscal year ending january   with early adoption permitted 
we have determined that this new guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued guidance amending certain fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in united states generally accepted accounting principles us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
the amendments change the wording used to describe many of the requirements in us gaap for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
the amendments are intended to create comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap and ifrs 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  we do not expect material financial statement implications relating to the adoption of this guidance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not issue or invest in financial instruments or their derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
our market risk is limited to fluctuations in interest rates pertaining to our borrowings under our existing debt facilities which require the payment of interest at a variable rate equal to one month libor plus to basis points 
we therefore are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on funded debt 
any increase in these rates could adversely affect our interest expense 
the extent of market rate risk associated with fluctuations in interest rates is not quantifiable or predictable because of the volatility of future interest rates and business financing requirements 
we use no derivative products to hedge or mitigate interest rate risk 
based on the outstanding balances on our credit facilities as of january   a increase in interest rates would cost us approximately  annually 
we purchase materials for use in our products based on market prices established with our suppliers 
many of the materials purchased can be subject to volatility due to market supply and demand factors outside of our control 
to mitigate this risk  in part  we attempt to enter into fixed price purchase agreements with reasonable terms 
we have limited market risk exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates as we have a limited number of purchase and sale transactions denominated in british pounds
